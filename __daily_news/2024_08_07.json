But Aruna Shahiâs team showed a significant revival to hold Iran to 24-24, with Usha Bhandari winning three points in a row. Iran earned the match points two more times but captain Shahi used her decade-long experience and wit before Niruta Thagunna capped off a brilliant Nepal comeback with a rock-solid spike.Having gained a 2-0 advantage, Nepal then won the third set, which also went neck-to-neck most of the time, to set up a mouth-watering final against India.It was also Nepalâs first ever victory over Iran in womenâs volleyball.âIt is a very happy moment for us,â said Nepal coach Jagadhish Bhatta during the presentation.âIran are technically sound. But our players were more motivated. Nepal had committed several mistakes against Iran in the previous game (group stage). Today our team corrected them,â he added.âObviously, our team made some mistakes against Iran (in the semi-final)â¦. but they were more cautious in the crucial moments.â Nepal will head into the final with full of confidence having beaten them 25-18, 12-25, 25-17, 18-25, 15-13 for a historic win.Bhatta was confident Nepal will repeat the feat again.âI believe in my team. I believe that Nepal will defeat India and win the trophy,â Bhatta added.Niruta Thagunna said Nepal will give their best in the final against India, once again.âWe have already defeated India once in this tournament. But we still have weaknesses to work on. We are ready for India,â said Thagunna, who had been one of the most outstanding players this season.

Yet the insecurity over the possible emergence of rival leaders apparently continues to gnaw at the septuagenarian leader. The much-discussed reentry of ex-Nepali President Bidya Devi Bhandari into the UML fold may have given Oli many sleepless nights. Bhandari is not his only headache. Speaking at a party meeting on Sunday, Oli warned the UML rank and file that no kind of factionalism would be tolerated in the party. He added, for good measure, that even though such diktats had been issued in the past, this time he was dead serious. But then the chairperson is himself being accused of promoting factionalism. For instance, Bishnu Paudel, a trusted lieutenant of Oli, was made the finance minister on top of his responsibility of monitoring the partyâs organisational activities. But Prithivi Subba Gurung, the new minister of information and communication, who has often had testy ties with Oli, is now without any responsibility in the party. (Earlier, he used to lead the UMLâs parliamentary affairs department.) The âburdenâ of dual responsibilities is apparently fine for a leader close to the party chair, someone more distant cannot be similarly overburdened. While Oli spoke on Sunday, he was also hinting at the undesirability of other possible factions in his party.

This tussle seems to have displeased Oli, perhaps because it suggests even his close acolytes might not be under his total control.A degree of competition is not just desirable but healthy for political parties. Yet Oli is having none of it. He warned his party that the promotion of factional politics in the name of internal democracy is unacceptable. Factionalism and internal democracy are both anathema to Oli. Even while he may boast that he will run the party for another two decades, it is only natural for those in and outside the UML to think of his eventual successor as party chair. Only with the right kind of debate will the right candidate emerge. Trying to maintain complete control is one sure way to break the party, as Oli found out in 2021. It might have worked to his advantage back then, yet if something like that happens again, Oliâs political stature is sure to be diminished. Oli as the partyâs custodian should be promoting healthy debates and discussions instead of trying to stifle dissent.

They also form the government, endorse its budget, policies and programmes, sanction treaties and agreements, monitor government activities and address citizensâ concerns. This makes the government accountable to the people through parliament. However, the legislative role extends beyond law-making to ensuring that laws achieve their objectives.Therefore, the Post-Legislative Scrutiny (PLS) concept emerged to meet the intended objective. The Law Commission of the United Kingdom defines it as \"a broad form of review, the purpose of which is to address the effects of the legislation in terms of whether the intended policy objectives have been met by the legislation and, if so, how effectively.\"The Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD), in its 2023 manual, defines PLS as a systematic and structured process through which parliaments review the implementation and impact of legislation. This process helps parliaments understand what worked well and what did not, and identify the best way forward. PLS in the UKIn the UK, all House of Commons and House of Lords committees are free to conduct PLS work. The process involves a formal review of Acts three to five years after Royal Assent. A PLS memorandum is published by the competent department and submitted to the relevant House of Commons select committee, which then decides whether further inquiry is needed. The involvement of both parliament and the government in PLS ensures comprehensive scrutiny. Since March 2008, the cabinet office has produced detailed guidance for departments on PLS, and the Guide to Making Legislation was reissued in 2022, including specific guidance on PLS. This ensures that ministries and departments submit explanatory memoranda on laws to the concerned parliamentary committees, which then endorse them or conduct wider examinations as necessary.The best part of the UKâs PLS model is its collaborative approach, involving both parliament and government. This makes PLS a parliamentary activity with a comprehensive evaluation involving multiple stakeholders. The UK model highlights the importance of systematic and structured reviews, providing clear guidelines for evaluating legislation and fostering a culture of accountability and continuous improvement in law-making and implementation.PLS in NepalNepal adopts a bicameral parliamentary system with the House of Representatives (HoRs) and the National Assembly (NA), collectively known as the Federal Parliament. Article 104 of the constitution mandates each House to frame rules to conduct its business, maintain order during meetings and regulate the committeesâ constitution, functions and procedures. Based on this, both Houses have developed separate regulations to manage their activities.Nepalâs NA initiated PLS in 2018 by incorporating provisions for \"evaluation, study, and researching the implementation status of the Act\" in its regulation. The HoRs followed suit in 2022 by including provisions for evaluating the implementation status of laws within its jurisdiction. The legislative management committee has the authority for PLS in the NA, whereas in the HoRs, all parliamentary committees share this responsibility. The NAâs public policy and delegated legislation committee is tasked with researching delegated legislation, an integral part of PLS.There are 10 parliamentary committees in the HoRs and four in the NA. HoRs Rule 178 defines the role of these committees, including evaluating the implementation status of laws. The NAâs legislative management committee is specifically responsible for managing PLS issues, as clarified in Rule 147. Although the NAâs regulations do not specify a timeframe for PLS, the legislative management committee has set a procedure for evaluating laws that have been in force for at least three years.The NAâs regulations, Rule 147(1), allow for \"evaluation, study, and researching the implementation status of the Act.\" Rule 148(B)(c) provides directions to the government based on reports prepared after studying and researching the effectiveness of implementing Acts. This structured approach ensures that the NA can effectively oversee the implementation of legislation and make recommendations for improvements.In contrast, the HoRs initially did not have specific provisions for PLS. However, the 2022 regulations included a clause in Rule 178(J) that allows the evaluation of the implementation of laws. The HoRsâ regulation now states that concerned committees can evaluate problems in implementation, issues to be improved, or the significance of laws related to their jurisdiction, which have been in force for at least three years. Additionally, the Speaker is responsible for determining the procedure for evaluating the status of law implementation. The parliament secretariat has drafted the procedure and handed it to the Speaker; however, according to a secretariat official, it has not yet been issued.The legislative management committee of the NA has conducted PLS on five laws so far. Despite the initial lack of formal provisions in the HoRs, the Law, Justice, and Human Rights Committee conducted PLS on two laws in 2078 BS, based on the understanding that PLS is a parliamentary privilege.An example of PLS in practice is found in the Sports Development Act, 2077. Section 57 of this Act mandates that the Sports Ministry evaluate its effectiveness five years post-authentication. This provision, introduced during the bill's discussions and subsequent parliamentary processes, marked the first inclusion of a PLS clause in Nepali law. Since then, by the end of July 2024, 14 acts authenticated by the president have included PLS provisions, emphasising the growing recognition of the need for systematic legislative evaluation.Implementation challengesHowever, despite these advancements, Nepal faces challenges in implementing PLS. A report by the legislative management committee in 2023 indicated that the implementation status of directions from PLS reports is poor. Similarly, the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives has not shown satisfactory execution of its PLS findings. Awareness of PLS among government ministries and bodies remains low, with many new bills lacking PLS provisions.Lessons from the UKSeveral recommendations can be drawn from both Nepali experiences and UK practices to address these issues. First, there should be uniformity in the terminology used across both Houses of Parliament. The NAâs \"evaluation of act\" is narrower than the HoRs' \"evaluation of laws.\" A standardised term like \"evaluation of implementation status of laws\" would align with international practices and provide more precise guidance.Second, parliamentary committees should evaluate acts and delegated legislation, incorporating these responsibilities within the broader framework of PLS. Additionally, government bodies must become more aware of the importance of PLS. Conducting seminars and training sessions can help make sure that PLS provisions are included in future bills.The legislative framework should also specify clear timelines for PLS. While the HoRs' regulations allow for PLS on laws in force for three years, the NAâs procedures are less explicit. Aligning these timelines will streamline the PLS process across both Houses.Furthermore, the Federal Parliament should maintain ultimate authority over PLS, allowing the government to conduct self-evaluations but reserving final quality assessments for parliamentary committees. This balance will ensure thorough scrutiny while maintaining accountability.Some Provincial Assemblies have now started using this tool. However, considering the coordination issues between the Federal Parliament and the federal government at the federal level, the Provincial Assemblies should first take the provincial government into confidence before proceeding with this work. Unless the provincial government takes full ownership, its full implementation is impossible. The Provincial Assembly and the government should work together.Nepalâs journey towards effective PLS can benefit significantly from the UKâs model. By fostering collaboration between parliament and the government, standardising procedures and raising awareness among government bodies, Nepal can enhance the effectiveness of its laws and ensure they continue to meet their intended objectives. Most importantly, continuously knocking on the government and parliamentary bodies, including the provinces, is essential. This process will succeed only by keeping them well-informed. Otherwise, it will not. Therefore, awareness programmes and training are the first and mandatory requirements.

These disadvantaged groups often lack the resources and agency to influence decisions impacting their lives. Climate justice emphasises that responsibilities for addressing climate change should align with contributions to the problem, considering systemic socio-economic and intergenerational inequalities.The crisis exacerbates economic disparities between countries, hindering poorer nationsâ ability to provide basic services and invest in sustainable development goals (SDGs). It intensifies competition for scarce resources like food, water, arable land and forests, restricting access for the poor and heightening socio-economic inequalities. Reports show that from 2010 to 2020, areas highly vulnerable to floods, droughts and storms experienced a mortality rate 15 times greater than regions with very low vulnerability. However, those most affected have the least influence on climate-related decisions, and policies often overlook their concerns and priorities.The Paris Agreement The Paris Agreement, established during COP21, marked a significant milestone in recognising climate injustice. Its aims include limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, building resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate impacts, and securing finance and support for low-carbon and climate-resilient development. Despite these goals, the global stocktake of the Paris Agreement at COP28 revealed slow progress in all areas of climate action, highlighting the urgent need for rapid greenhouse gas emission reductions. According to the Climate Policy Initiative (2023), less than 3 percent of the global total of adaptation finance went to or within least developed countries, and the 10 countries most affected by climate change, including Nepal, only received less than 2 percent of total climate finance between 2000 and 2019.Nepal in climate justiceAs a least-developed, mountainous nation contributing minimally to global greenhouse gas emissions, Nepal is uniquely positioned to advocate for global climate justice. The country faces disproportionate warming rates and erratic precipitation; its Himalayan glaciers at risk of significant volume loss by 2100. Nepal's economy, heavily reliant on climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture, tourism and hydropower, is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts.Nepal is a party to key international climate agreements, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. The country has developed a comprehensive climate change policy, a national adaptation plan (NAP) and a long-term strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045. Notably, Nepal has achieved its target of maintaining 45 percent forest cover by 2030 and is progressing well in clean energy generation and electric vehicle use. However, the country requires substantial financial support of $33 billion to achieve its 2030 NDC targets and $47 billion to implement NAP priority programmes by 2050.Recent leadership and milestones Nepal has prioritised mountain and climate change issues since preparing its National Adaptation Programme of Actions (NAPA) in 2010. Building on previous initiatives, the Government of Nepal began to systematically advocate for the mountain agenda in national and global forums last year. In 2023, Nepal initiated a systematic approach to climate justice. At the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Climate Ambition Summit (2023), COP28 and the Non-Aligned Movement, former PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal highlighted critical issues: Keeping global temperature increases below 1.5 degrees Celcius, delivering $100 billion per year to developing countries by 2025, doubling adaptation finance, ensuring climate finance is adequate and transparent, and addressing the concerns of vulnerable groups in climate action.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterresâs visit to Nepal further bolstered this advocacy, as he witnessed the devastating effects of climate change on the mountains and interacted with local communities. Guterresâs subsequent addresses called for committed international financial support for climate action, resonating with the urgency of Nepalâs situation.At COP28, Nepal hosted high-level sessions, including a âCall of the Mountainsâ roundtable, emphasising the need for expert dialogue on âMountains and Climate.â The COP28 decision to hold an expert dialogue on mountains and climate change at the 60th session of the SBSTA in Bonn in June 2024 was a significant achievement. Nepal further hosted the âMountains, People, and Climateâ international dialogue in May 2024 in Kathmandu, strengthening solidarity and prioritising mountain-based actions for climate justice.Immediate priorities and next stepsNepal must review and enhance its policies, institutions and capacities to address global and national climate needs. The second Environment Protection and Climate Change Management National Council meeting established a high-level task force to review and analyse existing policies, institutional capacities and coordination mechanisms, including learning from international practices. The task forceâs recommendations must be reviewed and adopted for effective implementation.Nepalâs capacity in international climate negotiations is inadequate due to the absence of a permanent negotiation team. A plan to form a permanent multi-sector negotiation team and enhance its capacity is underway, aiming to strengthen Nepalâs negotiation abilities at COP29 and beyond.Provisions related to climate actions in key government plans and programmes, such as the 16th Plan and the policies for the next fiscal year, must be implemented. This includes adopting risk-informed development practices, promoting climate-resilient infrastructure, applying an integrated approach to harmonise climate change and disaster risk planning and implementation, promoting international dialogue on climate change impacts on mountains and people and enhancing Nepalâs access to international climate finance. These include loss and damage funds as principles of climate justice and a rights-based approach. Moreover, the Government of Nepal (GoN) should prepare a strategic roadmap to define and support its journey to climate justice. This roadmap will reaffirm the governmentâs position and provide a pathway for advocacy. The GoN has already submitted a written statement to the International Court of Justice regarding state obligations concerning climate change and should actively participate in subsequent phases.Ensuring the participation and mobilisation of government, parliamentarians, civil society and the private sector is also crucial for a unified voice and commitment to climate justice. Nepal must clarify its position on accepting international climate finance and its conditionalities, emphasising that loans for resilient livelihoods or compensating loss and damage contradict social and environmental justice principles.Equally vital is continuing unified efforts among government, private sector and civil society, including marginalised and indigenous groups. By maintaining this momentum, Nepal can lead the global agenda on climate justice, advocating for the rights of vulnerable populations and contributing to the sustainable future of humanity and the planet. ","summary":"Climate change is an escalating threat to humanity and the planet, disproportionately affecting nations and populations that have contributed least to the problem. These disadvantaged groups often lack the resources and agency to influence decisions impacting their lives. Climate justice emphasises that responsibilities for addressing climate change should align with contributions to the problem, considering systemic socio-economic and intergenerational inequalities.The crisis exacerbates economic disparities between countries, hindering poorer nationsâ ability to provide basic services and invest in sustainable development goals (SDGs). It intensifies competition for scarce resources like food, water, arable land and forests, restricting access for the poor and heightening socio-economic inequalities. Reports show that from 2010 to 2020, areas highly vulnerable to floods, droughts and storms experienced a mortality rate 15 times greater than regions with very low vulnerability. However, those most affected have the least influence on climate-related decisions, and policies often overlook their concerns and priorities.The Paris Agreement The Paris Agreement, established during COP21, marked a significant milestone in recognising climate injustice. Its aims include limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, building resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate impacts, and securing finance and support for low-carbon and climate-resilient development. Despite these goals, the global stocktake of the Paris Agreement at COP28 revealed slow progress in all areas of climate action, highlighting the urgent need for rapid greenhouse gas emission reductions. According to the Climate Policy Initiative (2023), less than 3 percent of the global total of adaptation finance went to or within least developed countries, and the 10 countries most affected by climate change, including Nepal, only received less than 2 percent of total climate finance between 2000 and 2019.Nepal in climate justiceAs a least-developed, mountainous nation contributing minimally to global greenhouse gas emissions, Nepal is uniquely positioned to advocate for global climate justice. The country faces disproportionate warming rates and erratic precipitation; its Himalayan glaciers at risk of significant volume loss by 2100. Nepal's economy, heavily reliant on climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture, tourism and hydropower, is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts.Nepal is a party to key international climate agreements, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. The country has developed a comprehensive climate change policy, a national adaptation plan (NAP) and a long-term strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045. Notably, Nepal has achieved its target of maintaining 45 percent forest cover by 2030 and is progressing well in clean energy generation and electric vehicle use. However, the country requires substantial financial support of $33 billion to achieve its 2030 NDC targets and $47 billion to implement NAP priority programmes by 2050.Recent leadership and milestones Nepal has prioritised mountain and climate change issues since preparing its National Adaptation Programme of Actions (NAPA) in 2010.

Soon after a government falls and a new prime minister assumes office, provincial leaders are toppled, senior bureaucrats are transferred, and ministers are changedâand so are the ambassadors. Little do our leaders seem to care how detrimental the coming and going of envoys is for the countryâs image. The new coalition government headed by KP Oli has recently finalised the names of 19 envoys to serve in different capitals. The ambassadors appointed by the previous coalition under Pushpa Kamal Dahal were recalled. Only time will tell the fate of the new appointees, as we cannot say how long the incumbent government will last. Recalling envoys en masse every time there is a government change is not conducive for a country like Nepal that is having to maintain an increasingly difficult balance between major powers like India, China and the US. Ambassadors, when appointed to a new place, need some time to familiarise themselves with their new environment. But if they are replaced no sooner than they are appointed, the very purpose of diplomacy is lost. Half of Nepalâs ambassadors are political appointees and the rest are career diplomats. The political appointments in particular are problematic. Krishna Prasad Oli, a close associate of the prime minister, has been picked as the ambassador to China. (His main coalition partner, Sher Bahadur Deuba, the Nepali Congress chief, also undoubtedly got to have his say in other picks.) Oliâs envoys are predominantly so-called upper-caste men, with only four women and not a single Dalit ambassador nominee. There also seems to be little forethought on when and when not to recall ambassadors. Take the case of Shankar Sharma, Nepalâs former ambassador to India. Appointed by Deuba in March 2022 when he was in a coalition with Dahal, Sharma was recalled when Dahal allied with Oli to form a new government back in March this year. He has been reappointed after coming to power of the UML-Congress coalition. This kind of immature diplomacy with a country as important as India will do great harm to Nepalâs interests. Experts have suggested increasing the proportion of career diplomats as ambassadors from the current 50 percent to 80 or 90 percent. That will apparently decrease political meddling in the process. Perhaps an even better idea is to pick ambassadors, at least to important capitals like New Delhi, Beijing and Washington DC, on the basis of broad political understanding. After all, even if there is a change in government, a combination of the same two or three parties will come to power. If that is the case, why not make these picks judiciously through political consultations and let the ambassadors work for their full four-year term? That would also be in keeping with our national interest. One thing that can be done to ensure that the right people are picked is to make the nominees undergo a rigorous parliamentary vetting process. Up until now, such hearings for ambassador picks have been no more than rituals. But as we recently saw in the case of Krishna Man Pradhan, someone charged with sexual exploitation who was nominated as election commissioner, the parliamentary hearing process can be quite effective in keeping out the bad eggs. Again, in these testing times around the world for international relations and diplomacy, Nepal cannot afford to continue with its current ad hoc approach.

Waker-Uz-Zaman then reached out to Hasinaâs office, conveying to the prime minister that his soldiers would be unable to implement the lockdown she had called for, according to an Indian official briefed on the matter.The message was clear, the official said: Hasina no longer had the armyâs support.Details of the online meeting between military top brass and the message to Hasina that she had lost their backing have not previously been reported.They help to explain how Hasinaâs 15-year rule, during which she brooked little dissent, came to such a chaotic and sudden end on Monday, when she fled from Bangladesh to India.The nationwide curfew had been imposed after at least 91 people were killed and hundreds injured in nationwide clashes on Sunday, the deadliest day since student-led protests against Hasina began in July.Army spokesman Lt. Col. Sami Ud Dowla Chowdhury confirmed the Sunday evening discussions, which he described as a regular meeting to take updates after any disturbance. He did not provide details when presented with additional questions about decision-making at that meeting.Hasina could not be reached and her son and advisor, Sajeeb Wazed, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Reuters spoke to ten people familiar with the events of the past week, including four serving army officers and two other informed sources in Bangladesh, to piece together the final 48 hours of Hasinaâs reign. Many of them spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.Hasina, who has ruled Bangladesh for 20 of the last 30 years, was elected to a fourth term leading the country of 170 million in January, after arresting thousands of opposition leaders and workers. That election was boycotted by her main rivals.Her iron-fisted grasp on power has been challenged since summer by protests triggered by a court ruling to reserve government jobs - heavily coveted amid high youth unemployment - for certain segments of the population. The decision was overturned but the demonstrations had quickly morphed into a movement to oust Hasina.Zaman has not publicly explained his decision to withdraw support from Hasina. But the scale of the protests and a death toll of at least 241 made supporting Hasina at all costs untenable, three former senior Bangladesh army officers told Reuters.âThere was a lot of uneasiness within the troops,â said retired Brig. Gen. M. Sakhawat Hossain. âThat is what probably (put) pressure on the chief of army staff, because the troops are out and they are seeing what is happening.âZaman, who is related to Hasina by marriage, had showed signs of wavering in his support for the prime minister on Saturday, when he sat on an ornate wooden chair and addressed hundreds of uniformed officers in a town hall meeting. The military later made some details of that discussion public.The general declared that lives had to be protected and called on his officers to show patience, said army spokesman Chowdhury.It was the first indication that Bangladeshâs army would not forcefully suppress the violent demonstrations, leaving Hasina vulnerable.Retired senior soldiers such as Brig. Gen. Mohammad Shahedul Anam Khan were among those who defied the curfew on Monday and took to the streets.âWe were not stopped by the army,â said Khan, a former infantry soldier. âThe army has done what he had promised the army would do.ââSHORT NOTICEâOn Monday, the first full day of the indefinite nationwide curfew, Hasina was holed up inside the Ganabhaban, or âPeopleâs Palaceâ, a heavily-guarded complex in the capital Dhaka that serves as her official residence.Outside, on the streets of the sprawling city, crowds gathered. Tens of thousands of people had answered protest leadersâ call for a march to oust the leader, streaming into the heart of the city.With the situation spiralling out of her control, the 76-year-old leader decided to flee the country on Monday morning, according to the Indian official and two Bangladesh nationals familiar with the matter.Hasina and her sister, who lives in London but was in Dhaka at the time, discussed the matter and flew out together, according to a Bangladesh source. They left for India around lunch, local time.Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told parliament on Tuesday that New Delhi had urged âvarious political forces with whom we were in touchâ to resolve the situation via dialogue throughout July.But as crowds gathered in Dhaka on Monday ignoring the curfew, Hasina decided to resign âafter a meeting with leaders of the security establishmentâ, he added. âAt very short notice, she requested approval to come for the moment to India.âA second Indian official said it was âdiplomaticallyâ conveyed to Hasina that her stay had to be temporary for fear of negatively impacting Delhiâs ties with the next government in Dhaka. Indiaâs Ministry of External Affairs did not immediately return a request for comment.Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, whom the protesting students want to lead the interim government after Hasinaâs ouster, told The New Indian Express newspaper that India had âgood ties with the wrong people...

After Hasinaâs father was assassinated in 1975, Hasina took refuge in India for years and built deep links with her neighbourâs political elite.Returning to Bangladesh, she gained power in 1996, and was seen as more sensitive to Indiaâs security concerns than her political rivals. The Hindu-majority nation also regarded her secular stance as favourable for the 13 million Hindus in Bangladesh.But back in Bangladesh, resentment still lingered even among retired soldiers that Hasina had been allowed to leave.âPersonally, I feel that she should not have been given a safe passage,â said Khan, the veteran. âThat was a folly.â ","summary":"The night before long-time leader Sheikh Hasina abruptly fled Bangladesh amid deadly protests, her army chief held a meeting with his generals and decided that troops would not open fire on civilians to enforce a curfew, two serving army officers with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.Gen.

But a person familiar with Washingtonâs thinking said the selection suggested that Hamas could toughen its position in ceasefire negotiations and make it harder to reach a deal.They added, however, that Israel was already aware that even before his formal appointment Sinwar would have the final word on any agreement to halt the fighting, and the announcement merely set the seal on that.Ten months since the surprise attack by thousands of Hamas-led fighters who swarmed into Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip in the early hours of the morning of Oct. 7, the war has turned the Middle East on its head and threatened to spiral into a wider regional conflict.Some 1,200 Israelis and foreigners were killed and more than 250 taken hostage into Gaza. In response, Israel launched a relentless campaign that has so far killed almost 40,000 Palestinians and left the densely populated enclave in ruins.Attempts at reaching a ceasefire that would give the exhausted population a respite and enable the hostages remaining in captivity to be brought home have foundered amid mutual recriminations from Hamas and Israel.Hamas official Osama Hamdan told Al Jazeera that the movement remained committed to reaching a deal and the team that handled the negotiations under Haniyeh would continue under Sinwar, who he said was following the talks closely.But Hani Al-Masri, a political analyst in Ramallah, said Sinwarâs appointment to lead the movement overall was a direct challenge to Israel, and sent a message about Hamasâ adherence to his âextremist and resistant approachâ.âAs Sinwar manages the negotiations, he will manage the movement,â he said.

She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nationâs divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelorâs degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, âNot having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.âOn March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. âThere are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,â he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the âKumari Gharâ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. âMatina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,â said Shakya. âThe kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,â he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. âThe traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,â he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or âgoddessesâ, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjanâs complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, âIf Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.âThe case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the countryâs President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjanâs petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.âPeople who donât understand the culture shouldnât comment on it,â she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. âPeople who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,â she said.âAfter the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,â she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.âThe only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,â said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. âKumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumariâs tuition time,â he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.âThe Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,â said Shakya, former Kumari Matinaâs father.âSome people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I donât believe it violates any of my childâs rights.âWhile the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. âShe enjoys this normal life and it didnât take her long to adjust as well,â says Matinaâs father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. ","summary":"In 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nationâs divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelorâs degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, âNot having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.âOn March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. âThere are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,â he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the âKumari Gharâ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar.

During the construction phase, infrastructure generates real cash flow for workers and their families. In the long run, it has a direct and indirect impact on the economy, with a multiplier effect, particularly in job creation.In Rupandehi, which hosts the industrial city Bhairahawa, and Lumbini, a landmark of the Buddhist world listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997, infrastructure built with a sizeable investment has gone to waste.Big infrastructure projects like the international convention centre, meditation centre, industrial zones, and Gautam Buddha International Airport have failed to generate income and have turned into veritable white elephants.Nature has started reclaiming most of the under-utilised infrastructure.Since 2010, talk of building an international airport led to the construction of large-scale infrastructure, including a bevy of luxury hotels.Proliferating factories and a rapidly spreading transport network turned the Butwal-Bhairahawa metroplex into an economic powerhouse.Nepal opened its second international airport in May 2022 in the southern city of Bhairahawa, but no international flight stops there right now.The objective of building an international airport in Bhairahawa was to bring in more tourists, energise businesses and create jobs. But the situation is just the opposite. Traders are closing down their shops and moving abroad for decent jobs.The private sector, too, invested heavily. When the finished project started to sit idle, it hit the sector, and many enterprises were teetering into bankruptcy.Economists term this development in Lumbini a cascading failureâa breakdown in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts leads to the failure of other parts. Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician and data curator at the National Statistics Office, said Lumbini province saw heavy investment from the government and the private sector, but the output has slowed. âEnterprises are unable to raise even the operating cost.âIn the last fiscal year, Lumbini province was estimated to grow at 4.05 percent to a GDP of Rs814 billion, from the low base of the 1.99 percent growth it had achieved in the previous fiscal year. Lumbini is estimated to contribute 14.26 percent to the national GDP. The highest value-added growth rate in Lumbini was in electricity and gas, which grew by 28.93 percent, while the manufacturing sector was estimated to shrink by a negative 1.43 percent in the last fiscal year.Most completed infrastructures in Lumbini have become white elephants, as their expenditures have been growing instead of them generating income. The Butwal International Convention Center, built with an investment of Rs1.11 billion in ward 10 of Butwal Sub Metropolis, is currently without business. The centre has 13 halls, each with a capacity to accommodate 2,700 people. The auditorium is the largest of the 13.The government built the convention centre to organise national and international conferences and events, but it is not generating much income. Construction started in 2014 and the centre was inaugurated in August 2022.Officials say that the centre is struggling to pay its staff. While the centre is under-utilised and lacks maintenance, bushes have grown around it.Dharmendra Panthi, chief of the Butwal International Convention Center project, said 22 events or functions have been conducted in the past three years, earning Rs4 million. The centre is currently closed as the provincial cabinet is yet to pass the operating guidelines even in three years.However, Panthi said they have been occasionally renting the hall on request. The centre charges Rs96,000 for a day-long event.Prabin Pathak, president of the Nepal Hoteliers Association, who took part in a recent function at the convention centre, said the infrastructure is in a sorry state due to lack of periodic maintenance.âIf the building is not utilised properly, it will be a waste of tax money,â said Pathak. âThe washroom faucets are dry, and it is difficult to sit in the hall due to the stench from the washroom.ââIn Nepal, there is a growing trend of building new infrastructure, but their upkeep is often ignored. This is sad,â Pathak said. âNo one is accountable for the losses the projects incur. Similarly, questions are raised about the quality of construction. In most projects, low-quality materials are used, severely compromising the structural integrity.âA hall with a capacity to accommodate 5,000 people built near the Buddhaâs birthplace, Lumbini, has yet to do any business, except hosting a few functions. It was built with an investment of Rs720 million.Sanuraja Shakya, member-secretary of the Lumbini Development Trust, said that if a social organisation wants to conduct a function at the centre, they have to pay a fee.Shakya said that since it is a meditation centre, they do not allow other functions, especially those involving entertainment.Questions were raised about the construction when the roof started leaking soon after projectâs completion. It was repaired later.Likewise, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Bhairahawa, has not been fully operational for a long time. As factories have not been set up in the SEZ, the area has turned into a jungle. Construction of the SEZ had started in 2003 and it was inaugurated in 2014.Located in south-central Nepal, the Bhairahawa Special Economic Zone has 69 industrial plots of sizes from 1,400 to 3,700 square metres. A few industrialists have booked plots, but have not set up their plants as the government has failed to provide pledged services and amenities. The government had promised to provide 24-hour electricity, a one-stop service system, customs, banks, and insurance among other things inside the SEZ.âEvery year, new entrepreneurs book plots, but do not set up their factories due to associated tough conditions,â said Saput Dumre, assistant director of SEZ. Dumre said industrialists are concerned about the mandatory export provision. According to SEZ guidelines, which were amended three months ago, firms that lease space inside the SEZ must export at least 30 percent of manufactured goods. âThere is a water tank in the SEZ, but it has no water, the weighing machine does not work, the petrol pump is defunct, there are no parking areas, and the road is covered in thick bushes,â said Ujjwal Prasad Kasaju, a central member of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Then there is the new Gautam Buddha International Airportâall dressed up, and nowhere to go. The airport awaits applications for flight slots from international airlines after more than two years of opening.Nepal's second international airport was ready after ten years and nearly Rs40 billion pumped into the project, but despite the build-up, the expected rush of eager carriers is nowhere to be seen.The airport is a landmark located in south central Nepal and spread over 787 bighas (533 hectares).The modern facility has a 15,169-square-metre terminal building that can serve nearly a million passengers a year. The airport's 3,000-metre runway is long enough to handle the largest commercial jets. However, no commercial jet wants to fly to the airport. ","summary":"Lumbini's infrastructure, including an international airport, convention center, meditation center, and industrial zones, built with significant investment, now lie idle, leading to a cascading economic failure, while private sector enterprises struggle with idle infrastructure."},{"hash":"e17b47f7fe003ff92cb68f3a60c5e56f43cd2569481cb36acb8704cb44d7a5f9","title":"navigating-kathmandu-with-disability-is-a-challenge","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/kathmandu/2024/07/28/navigating-kathmandu-with-disability-is-a-challenge","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/thumb3-1722125796.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1722124800000,"source":"kp","category":"kathmandu","content":"In Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions. While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadiâs scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.âI donât know if I can call the footpaths accessible,â Dawadi says. âThere is tactile paving for white cane users but itâs not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.âHer experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isnât entirely critical; she appreciates the KMCâs sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesnât just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. âThey need options that wonât affect their income; a crackdown wonât work.âDawadi emphasises that KMC shouldnât view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure âdisabled-friendly.â Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. âPeople with disabilities should be involved in planning,â she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.âOn many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,â he explains. âThe footpath has become just a showpiece.âRishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmanduâs footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministryâs Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMCâs recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishiâs organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.âThe constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,â Adhikari said. âForget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.âRishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, âforcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.â This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.âDespite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,â Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. âThis reflects a major failure of the stateâs duty,â he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the countryâs road infrastructure. âWe donât know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,â she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. âWithout clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, itâs hard for us to find our destinations,â Ray says. âAs I canât hear, I rely on signs for guidance.âRay also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. âCrossing the road can be chaotic,â he notes. âWith drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.âRay was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didnât suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMCâs new footpaths and railings are a step forward but âthey are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.âAccording to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term âdisabled-friendlyâ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an âinclusivity checklistâ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. âWhat about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?â he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, âStates Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.âDespite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. âThereâs no guidance or facilities for us,â she said.Shrestha criticises the KMCâs approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. âConstruction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,â he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. âWhile weâre committed to making footpaths accessible, weâre not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,â he said.âWeâve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we canât address every issue alone.âBaburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. âWe are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,â he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.âWeâve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmanduâs pavements and roads, but that doesnât mean theyâre not problematic,â Kumal says. âAccessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.â ","summary":"In Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions.

But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.âOn many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,â he explains. âThe footpath has become just a showpiece.âRishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmanduâs footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministryâs Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMCâs recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishiâs organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.âThe constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,â Adhikari said. âForget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.âRishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, âforcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.â This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.âDespite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,â Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. âThis reflects a major failure of the stateâs duty,â he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the countryâs road infrastructure. âWe donât know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,â she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. âWithout clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, itâs hard for us to find our destinations,â Ray says. âAs I canât hear, I rely on signs for guidance.âRay also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. âCrossing the road can be chaotic,â he notes. âWith drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.âRay was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didnât suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMCâs new footpaths and railings are a step forward but âthey are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.âAccording to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term âdisabled-friendlyâ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an âinclusivity checklistâ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. âWhat about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?â he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, âStates Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.âDespite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. âThereâs no guidance or facilities for us,â she said.Shrestha criticises the KMCâs approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. âConstruction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,â he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. âWhile weâre committed to making footpaths accessible, weâre not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,â he said.âWeâve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we canât address every issue alone.âBaburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. âWe are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,â he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.âWeâve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmanduâs pavements and roads, but that doesnât mean theyâre not problematic,â Kumal says. âAccessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.â "},{"hash":"6f3b51d5018bef5f0354fdc058c4c368aff98622a31bdb15cb1d933bfa3d6a6e","title":"monetary-policy-orchestration","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/07/29/monetary-policy-orchestration","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/LeadPostFile1-1722260285.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1722211200000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"The Monetary Policy for Fiscal Year 2024-25 issued last Friday by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the monetary authority of Nepal, is generally hailed as expansionary.

These, indeed, are more reactive than well-thought-out sustainable policy responses that are unlikely to deliver desirable impacts on containing the severe recessionary trends faced by the economy.Monetary policy-makingFor decades now, Nepalâs monetary policy formulation has been a ritual orchestration rather than a substantive assertion of legally empowered independence by the NRB. The first compromise on monetary policy independence emanated from the fact that the Nepali currency is strictly pegged with the Indian currency. Pragmatically, the pluses of this arrangement may outweigh the minuses for the Nepali economy, so policymakers are not even considering discontinuing it.First, according to the universally acclaimed monetary theory of the impossible trinity, âa country canât have a fixed exchange rate, independent monetary policy, and free capital movement all at onceâ.

It will have a bearing on both investment and foreign exchange reserves. The new monetary policy grossly overlooks this phenomenon.Despite repeating a decade-old idea of setting up a second-tier oversight institution to regulate the saving and credit cooperatives and streamlining the operations of the microfinance institutions, the policy has blatantly failed to reinvigorate the small-and-medium-enterprise (SME) ecosystem. At present, the SMEs of Nepal face a grave crisis of legal/official recognition that has, in turn, impeded their access to formal financing mechanisms.The Economic Census of Nepal 2018 has shown that out of 923,356 establishments, only 462,605, or 50.1 percent, are registered.

Political analysts and observers, too, say that Thapa and Sharma have failed to reflect the strength of their popular mandate in the party decision making process.Prior to its 14th general convention, the party had the provision of one elected general secretary whereas the other was nominated by the party President after the general convention. In the last convention, the party amended its statute and made it mandatory to elect both the general secretaries and other party bearers through voting.With Thapa and Sharma elected as the Congress general secretaries, they were expected to challenge the septuagenarian party President Sher Bahadur Deuba.However, as a party insider claims, the general secretary duo themselves are struggling to create their space in party leadership. This struggle is a testament to the challenges they face in cementing their influence in the Congress, says a party leader.âThe partyâs general secretary is usually occupied with official work,â Prakash Sharan Mahat, a Congress spokesperson, told the Post. âHow active they are in the partyâs internal affairs is not something I can comment on.âAfter being elected as the partyâs general secretaries, Thapa and Sharma have publicly spoken about being kept in the dark on vital matters. For instance, while speaking at the 42nd BP Memorial programme held on July 20, Thapa said the July 1 agreement between Congress and CPN-UML reached to form a new coalition government came as a surprise.Purushottam Dahal, a senior journalist close to the Congress, says the two general secretaries didnât understand their exact role.âThe general secretaryâs role is to make the partyâs central secretariat functional, but they are trying to be reactionary, which is inappropriate,â Dahal told the Post. âTo make the party functional, they should not wait for a green signal from the party president.âHowever, General Secretary Sharma rubbishes such a claim.âThere have been some transformative changes in the party after we assumed the role of general secretaries,â Sharma told the Post. âFrom establishing a library in the partyâs central office to holding the BP Koirala Literature Festival, we have made the party more vibrant.âHe argued that what has happened is that the duo have failed to publicise some of their important works.The general secretaries claim they are facing difficulties because of the party leadershipâs working style, but some leaders donât buy that argument.Sharma further claims that their work is often hindered by the generational gap with Deuba.âIn addition, both of us general secretaries were elected from different panels during the general convention, which caused some misunderstanding among party leaders,â Sharma said.But there are other Congress leaders who accuse the general secretaries of suddenly turning risk-averse. âThey are bound by the party statute as the party follows a presidential system where the president prevails over others,â Govinda Pokharel, a newly appointed head of the Economic Policy and Planning Department of the Congress, told the Post. âHowever, the two general secretaries cannot accommodate all groups in the party, and hence their difficulties.â According to Pokharel, after becoming the partyâs office bearers, they are slowly turning cautious. âAlthough they have a very popular base and they also have content-based knowledge on development, they are not being able to use their potential.â Sharma differs.âWe have challenged the party leadership on many issues to establish our agenda,â Sharma said. âAt the partyâs Mahasamiti meeting in February, we successfully proposed contesting the upcoming election with the partyâs own strengthâ¦ The party's central committee meeting, which will commence on Wednesday, will pass our proposal as it is.â A Congress leader close to General Secretary Thapa, however, acknowledged that Thapa is sometimes clueless about the partyâs functioning.âFrom the beginning, the general secretaries have not been able to mobilise the leaders in their fold effectively,â Shankar Tiwari, a Congress youth leader close to Thapa, told the Post. âSometimes they prevail over the party president, but on many other occasions they are also at his mercy.âMeanwhile, a few Congress leaders claim that the popularity of the general secretaries duo is diminishing, which could make it difficult for them to elevate themselves in party politics in the coming days. There are ample examples where Congress leaders lost their revolutionary spirit after becoming general secretary, says the leader.Only three past general secretaries of Congress have succeeded in becoming party chief and the prime minister. Krishna Prasad Bhattarai was the general secretary of the party soon after the establishment of democracy in Nepal in 1950. Likewise, Girija Prasad Koirala, another general secretary during the 1990s, later became the prime minister as well as the party President. Sushil Koirala was the third general secretary to become party president, and the prime minister. Jagat Nepal, a long-time Congress observer, says that apart from the prime minister, two of the Congressâs general secretaries have become the countryâs President, if not party president and prime minister. âRam Baran Yadav, the first President of the country, and Ramchandra Paudel, the current President, both were once the partyâs general secretary,â Nepal told the Post. Besides, Taranath Ranabhat, the former general secretary of the party, and Paudel became Speakers of the House of Representatives in the 1990s.Nepal added that despite not being elevated to the partyâs top position, a few former general secretaries of Congress had played an important role in national politics. âWe canât draw a sweeping conclusion that leaders lose their influence after becoming general secretary,â he said.Apart from the leaders mentioned above, Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, Krishna Prasad Sitaula, Prakash Man Singh, Sashank Koirala, and Purna Bahadur Khadka were the few among others who took up the responsibility of the general secretary.âAs far as why they were not able to lift themselves to the top position is concerned, sometimes, despite their personal efficiency, circumstances might not be favourable,â Dahal, the senior journalist, said.General Secretary Sharma echoes Dahal.In the past, the party president used to nominate one of the two general secretaries. In such a case, the nominated general secretary would obviously not be able to challenge the party chief, Sharma said. From the 14th general convention, the party started to elect both general secretaries through voting by party delegates.

This struggle is a testament to the challenges they face in cementing their influence in the Congress, says a party leader.âThe partyâs general secretary is usually occupied with official work,â Prakash Sharan Mahat, a Congress spokesperson, told the Post. âHow active they are in the partyâs internal affairs is not something I can comment on.âAfter being elected as the partyâs general secretaries, Thapa and Sharma have publicly spoken about being kept in the dark on vital matters. For instance, while speaking at the 42nd BP Memorial programme held on July 20, Thapa said the July 1 agreement between Congress and CPN-UML reached to form a new coalition government came as a surprise.Purushottam Dahal, a senior journalist close to the Congress, says the two general secretaries didnât understand their exact role.âThe general secretaryâs role is to make the partyâs central secretariat functional, but they are trying to be reactionary, which is inappropriate,â Dahal told the Post. âTo make the party functional, they should not wait for a green signal from the party president.âHowever, General Secretary Sharma rubbishes such a claim.âThere have been some transformative changes in the party after we assumed the role of general secretaries,â Sharma told the Post. âFrom establishing a library in the partyâs central office to holding the BP Koirala Literature Festival, we have made the party more vibrant.âHe argued that what has happened is that the duo have failed to publicise some of their important works.The general secretaries claim they are facing difficulties because of the party leadershipâs working style, but some leaders donât buy that argument.Sharma further claims that their work is often hindered by the generational gap with Deuba.âIn addition, both of us general secretaries were elected from different panels during the general convention, which caused some misunderstanding among party leaders,â Sharma said.But there are other Congress leaders who accuse the general secretaries of suddenly turning risk-averse. âThey are bound by the party statute as the party follows a presidential system where the president prevails over others,â Govinda Pokharel, a newly appointed head of the Economic Policy and Planning Department of the Congress, told the Post. âHowever, the two general secretaries cannot accommodate all groups in the party, and hence their difficulties.â According to Pokharel, after becoming the partyâs office bearers, they are slowly turning cautious. âAlthough they have a very popular base and they also have content-based knowledge on development, they are not being able to use their potential.â Sharma differs.âWe have challenged the party leadership on many issues to establish our agenda,â Sharma said. âAt the partyâs Mahasamiti meeting in February, we successfully proposed contesting the upcoming election with the partyâs own strengthâ¦ The party's central committee meeting, which will commence on Wednesday, will pass our proposal as it is.â A Congress leader close to General Secretary Thapa, however, acknowledged that Thapa is sometimes clueless about the partyâs functioning.âFrom the beginning, the general secretaries have not been able to mobilise the leaders in their fold effectively,â Shankar Tiwari, a Congress youth leader close to Thapa, told the Post. âSometimes they prevail over the party president, but on many other occasions they are also at his mercy.âMeanwhile, a few Congress leaders claim that the popularity of the general secretaries duo is diminishing, which could make it difficult for them to elevate themselves in party politics in the coming days. There are ample examples where Congress leaders lost their revolutionary spirit after becoming general secretary, says the leader.Only three past general secretaries of Congress have succeeded in becoming party chief and the prime minister. Krishna Prasad Bhattarai was the general secretary of the party soon after the establishment of democracy in Nepal in 1950. Likewise, Girija Prasad Koirala, another general secretary during the 1990s, later became the prime minister as well as the party President. Sushil Koirala was the third general secretary to become party president, and the prime minister. Jagat Nepal, a long-time Congress observer, says that apart from the prime minister, two of the Congressâs general secretaries have become the countryâs President, if not party president and prime minister. âRam Baran Yadav, the first President of the country, and Ramchandra Paudel, the current President, both were once the partyâs general secretary,â Nepal told the Post. Besides, Taranath Ranabhat, the former general secretary of the party, and Paudel became Speakers of the House of Representatives in the 1990s.Nepal added that despite not being elevated to the partyâs top position, a few former general secretaries of Congress had played an important role in national politics. âWe canât draw a sweeping conclusion that leaders lose their influence after becoming general secretary,â he said.Apart from the leaders mentioned above, Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, Krishna Prasad Sitaula, Prakash Man Singh, Sashank Koirala, and Purna Bahadur Khadka were the few among others who took up the responsibility of the general secretary.âAs far as why they were not able to lift themselves to the top position is concerned, sometimes, despite their personal efficiency, circumstances might not be favourable,â Dahal, the senior journalist, said.General Secretary Sharma echoes Dahal.In the past, the party president used to nominate one of the two general secretaries. In such a case, the nominated general secretary would obviously not be able to challenge the party chief, Sharma said. From the 14th general convention, the party started to elect both general secretaries through voting by party delegates.

During the party convention, rival leaders often present parallel political documents.While the incumbent party chief presents a political paper, those from the anti-establishment camp float a different paper to counter its ideas. This eventually sets the ground for a two-line struggle in a communist party. Though communists tried to sugarcoat the two-line struggle as a way to rejuvenate party activities and strengthen intra-party democracy, political analysts say such exercise is limited to propping up factions.Â For Nepali politicians, factions are platforms to exercise power. âWhen two or more leaders with parallel influential groups exist within the party, that often results in factionalism,â Keshav Dahal, a political analyst, told the Post. âBut when there are no leaders to challenge the partyâs top leader, there remain fewer chances for groupism.âAfter a group of UML leaders under former party chiefs Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal split the party to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) in 2021, there was no one to openly challenge Oli. Therefore, the UML doesnât have a faction now running activities parallel to the party establishment from the centre to the grassroots, which used to be the case in the past.Oli was the one who led a strong faction for many years when Nepal or Khanal was the party chief. Then, why is Oli himself afraid of factional activities in the party?UML leaders say there are no reasons for the party chair to fear from an exercise of intra-party democracy if the top leaders donât promote factional activities.âIt is the duty of the party leader not to engage in factionalism within the party, rather than urging party members not to do so,â Usha Kiran Timilsina, a central committee member of the UML, told the Post. âIf the leadership does not promote this, party members will automatically avoid factionalism.âAnother UML leader lambasted Oli for being the party's arbitrary leader and a promoter of groupism.A UML standing committee member said the partyâs central secretariat meeting on August 1 showed favouritism while deciding a work division among top leaders. He claimed that leaders close to Oli and General Secretary Shankar Pokharel got important responsibilities while others were sidelined.When Prithvi Subba Gurung, the minister for communication and information technology in the Oli Cabinet, is relieved of party responsibilities after becoming minister, Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel of the same Cabinet is given the partyâs responsibility as well, the leader told the Post, requesting anonymity.According to the work division decided last week, Paudel still coordinates the monitoring of the partyâs organisational activities. Gurung had earlier got the responsibility of leading the partyâs parliamentary affairs department.

The tussle visible among second-rung leaders while picking the chief minister in Lumbini is the latest case in point.When the Congress and the UML decided to form the Lumbini provincial government under the UMLâs leadership, many saw UMLâs Lumbini Assembly leader Leela Giri as a natural candidate for chief minister.However, Chet Nath Acharya, the deputy leader of the assembly, was appointed the chief minister on July 22. Giri is close to party vice-chair Bishnu Paudel while Acharya is loyal to Pokharel. As General Secretary Pokharel is closer to Oli, the party chief directly instructed Lumbini assembly members of the UML to support Acharyaânot Giri. âWe are not sure why the party selected Acharya instead of Giri, but we believe it was due to the rivalry between party vice-chair Paudel and General Secretary Pokharel,â a provincial assembly member then told the Post on the condition of anonymity.âDue to the personal rivalry between Paudel and Pokharel, Acharya got the opportunity despite Giri having been considered the chief minister.âDuring the party's provincial convention held in September last year, Paudel and Pokharel were fiercely engaged in electing leaders loyal to them as the provincial committee chair.

They included some key Maoist leaders such as Ram Bahadur Thapa, Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, Lekh Raj Bhatta, Prabhu Sah and Mani Thapa. Some central committee members and scores of other cadres from various lower committees followed them to join the UML, the bigger communist party among the two.The UML and the Maoist Centre jointly fought the general elections in 2017 and later merged to form the NCP in 2018. But the merger was challenged in court, accusing them of copying the name of a fringe communist party. The Supreme Court in 2021 invalidated the merger, reviving their original parties.While around 30 central level Maoist leaders had joined UML, only a few have succeeded to hold important positions in the UML.CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli on Thursday convened the partyâs central secretariat meeting to divide work among the leaders as several of them have become ministers in federal and provincial governments. The same meeting relieved former Maoist leader Mani Thapa of all his positions and roles from the party citing his failure to fulfill the roles and responsibilities assigned by the organisation.Thapa, who was a standing committee member in the UML, however, had reportedly tendered his resignation around a year ago expressing his differences on various issues with the UML leadership.Former key maoist leaders Ram Bahadur Thapa and Lekh Raj Bhatta are now vice-chair and secretary in the UML, respectively. Former Maoist leader Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, who was elected UML secretary in 2022, is now suspended after he is accused in Bhutanese refugee scam. He is now in judicial custody as the case is sub-judice.Prabhu Sah, a prominent Maoist leader of Madhesh Province, quit the UML to form the Aam Janata Party.Lil Bahadur Thapa and Jwala Kumari Sah are politburo members in the UML.According to multiple UML leaders with Maoist background, Mani Thapa remained inactive in the party activities and he also remained inactive during the November 2022 election.A Maoist-turned-UML leader said that the former Maoist Centre leaders, who were given more importance at the time of NCP split and immediately after joining the UML, were gradually sidelined. âThat was one of the reasons why Mani Thapa became inactive in party activities,â the leader told the Post requesting anonymity.At the time of the NCP split, UML chair Oli was in serious trouble as the then UML leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhalanath Khanal, backed by a powerful group of second-rung leaders, had challenged him in the party. At the time, Oli managed to stay in the leadership taking support of the former Maoist leaders.âThapa was a standing committee member in the UML. I am not aware of what exactly he had expected in the party but he was unhappy,â another UML leader with Maoist background told the Post. âIt was Thapaâs personal decision to stay away from party activities.

Some Maoist leaders got a chance to become ministers after joining the UML, says a UML leader.Mani Thapa himself was never given a ministerial position as a Maoist Centre leader but soon after joining the UML, he got the opportunity to lead the Ministry of Water Supply under the KP Sharma Oli government.Similarly, Jwala Kumari Sah held ministerial berths more than three times after joining the UML.Giridharilal Naupane, another UML leader with Maoist background, claimed that the leadersâ former Maoist background was no longer an issue in the UML. âWe former Maoist leaders have already been mixed in the UML like sugar in water,â he said. âIf some former Maoist leader raises the question to UML, it is due to their misunderstanding.âMeanwhile, some leaders argue that the UML leadership didnât support Rayamajhi when he got in trouble after being accused in the refugee scam. The party leader still considered Rayamajhi an outsider, they say.âIf any UML leader other than Rayamajhi was indicted in the refugee scam, the UML would have made a lot of efforts to release him from custody,â a Maoist-turned-UML leader told the Post on condition of anonymity.However, Maoist-turned-UML leader Tanka Angbuhang, who claims to have met Rayamajhi recently in jail, claims that Rayamajhi himself does not feel the party has alienated him.âDuring our meeting, Rayamajhi did not show any displeasure to the party,â Aangbuhang told the Post. ","summary":"When the Supreme Courtâs verdict in March 2021 dissolved the then Nepal Communist Party (NCP) and revived the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre), most of the leaders returned to their mother parties.A group of Maoist leaders, however, joined the UML. They included some key Maoist leaders such as Ram Bahadur Thapa, Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, Lekh Raj Bhatta, Prabhu Sah and Mani Thapa. Some central committee members and scores of other cadres from various lower committees followed them to join the UML, the bigger communist party among the two.The UML and the Maoist Centre jointly fought the general elections in 2017 and later merged to form the NCP in 2018. But the merger was challenged in court, accusing them of copying the name of a fringe communist party. The Supreme Court in 2021 invalidated the merger, reviving their original parties.While around 30 central level Maoist leaders had joined UML, only a few have succeeded to hold important positions in the UML.CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli on Thursday convened the partyâs central secretariat meeting to divide work among the leaders as several of them have become ministers in federal and provincial governments. The same meeting relieved former Maoist leader Mani Thapa of all his positions and roles from the party citing his failure to fulfill the roles and responsibilities assigned by the organisation.Thapa, who was a standing committee member in the UML, however, had reportedly tendered his resignation around a year ago expressing his differences on various issues with the UML leadership.Former key maoist leaders Ram Bahadur Thapa and Lekh Raj Bhatta are now vice-chair and secretary in the UML, respectively. Former Maoist leader Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, who was elected UML secretary in 2022, is now suspended after he is accused in Bhutanese refugee scam. He is now in judicial custody as the case is sub-judice.Prabhu Sah, a prominent Maoist leader of Madhesh Province, quit the UML to form the Aam Janata Party.Lil Bahadur Thapa and Jwala Kumari Sah are politburo members in the UML.According to multiple UML leaders with Maoist background, Mani Thapa remained inactive in the party activities and he also remained inactive during the November 2022 election.A Maoist-turned-UML leader said that the former Maoist Centre leaders, who were given more importance at the time of NCP split and immediately after joining the UML, were gradually sidelined. âThat was one of the reasons why Mani Thapa became inactive in party activities,â the leader told the Post requesting anonymity.At the time of the NCP split, UML chair Oli was in serious trouble as the then UML leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhalanath Khanal, backed by a powerful group of second-rung leaders, had challenged him in the party. At the time, Oli managed to stay in the leadership taking support of the former Maoist leaders.âThapa was a standing committee member in the UML. I am not aware of what exactly he had expected in the party but he was unhappy,â another UML leader with Maoist background told the Post. âIt was Thapaâs personal decision to stay away from party activities. It has nothing to do with the partyâs work style.âThe Postâs attempts to contact Thapa were unsuccessful.Among the leaders who left the Maoist Centre to join the UML, Ram Bahadur Thapa, Rayamajhi, and Bhatta had played crucial roles in leading the decade-long Maoist insurgency.Some UML leaders with Maoist backgrounds admitted that they get discouraged when the party leadership does not acknowledge the peopleâs war.

Officials at the Public Construction Department under the metropolis said that the contractor resumed the work after the High Court, Patan issued an interim order paving the way for following an interim order from the High Court, Patan allowing the work to proceed. âNow there is no obstruction from locals nor from federal government agencies,â said Baburam Bhattarai, a member of the City Planning Commission under the KMC. âWe hope that the project will be completed at the earliest.âThe metropolis had awarded a contract to widen the sidewalks by 1.5 metres along both sides of the road section between the New Road gate and the Juddha Statue roundabout in the last fiscal year. The work started in the New Road area in May, but a jurisdictional dispute between the city office and the Road Division, Kathmandu, caused the project to come to a halt. The division confiscated contractorsâ equipment, and the federal government deployed police in to prevent the city office from working. Some local residents, too, had demonstrated against the pavement widening plan. The division had even repaired the parts of roads cut for pavement expansion.And on June 9, the metropolis moved the High Court challenging the breach of jurisdiction by the road division, which is a federal agency, and its intervention in the cityâs work.City officials were already frustrated by the years-long delay by federal agencies in completing another project, the widening of Kathmanduâs Ring Road in the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section, which has caused huge inconvenience to the public due to dust and mud.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed city officials to dump truckloads of dirt from the Ring Road section in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office at Minbhawan, accusing federal agencies of delaying the work.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years due to Covid and delays in clearing the power poles and in some cases structures along the right of way.Regarding the jurisdiction dispute over the sidewalk widening work in the city, a division bench of judges Dhurba Raj Nand and Prakash Kharel at the High Court Patan issued an interim order in favour of the metropolis on Sunday.The City office has already widening pavements by 1 metre on both sides in the Bhrikutimandap area. âNeither did the federal government agency intervene, nor did locals object while expanding pavement in the Bhrikutimandap area by narrowing the road,â said Bhattarai. âFurther decisions on pavement widening in other areas like Thamel, Handigaun and others will be taken after collecting public feedback.âOfficials said that the long-term plan is to restrict motor vehicles altogether in the New Road area due to heavy pedestrian traffic. âWe have also been working to find a solution to the parking problem and weighing various options including setting up multi-storey parking facilities,â said Bhattarai, who is also an urban planner.Officials said that pavements in the New Road area, which always remain crowded, should be widened to ensure free pedestrian movement. Officials claimed that New Road residents have also requested the city office to expand the pavement.According to city officials, local residents have, from time to time, complained about feeling unsafe and experiencing sexual harassment on the narrow and crowded sidewalks.

Officials said the move aims to ensure smooth transfer of waste as roads to the landfill often become impassable during the monsoon, preventing the passage of garbage trucks.âWe have deployed three excavators, two bulldozers and two loaders to clear landslide debris along the road to the Bancharedanda landfill,â said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. âAlso, we have kept five more vehicles on standby for immediate deployment if needed.âEvery year, during monsoon season, the road to landfill sites gets obstructed in multiple places, obstructing the transfer of house waste collected in the three districts of the capital cityâKathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Apart from these, some local levels of Kavrepalanchok also discard garbage at the landfill site at Bancharedanda.The metropolis officials said that they had purchased 10 high-pressure pumps to drain floodwaters from inundated settlements.âFive pumps have already been sent to the high-risk areas along riversides,â said Shrestha. âThese can quickly pump away floodwaters.âThe city office started repairing the Sisdole road leading to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district just a few weeks before the start of the monsoon. Officials said Rs30 million had been allocated for repairs, which included fixing potholes, concreting roads, and other works.Around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised, according to officials.Besides monsoon-induced road obstructions, garbage disposal is sometimes disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions cause weeks-long halt to door-to-door garbage collection, leading people in the Valley to discard their trash on streets.Officials said that a high-pressure pump is being used to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground.Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The City office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMCâs waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.The city office recently sold non-degradable waste worth Rs700,000.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmanduâs chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didnât work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMCâs part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled.

This will be the first commercial work an unmanned aerial vehicle does in Nepalâs high-altitude zone.The heavy lifter from Chinaâs biggest drone maker, Da Jiang Innovations (DJI), will take on tasks traditionally handled by Sherpas. Officials believe it will help reduce casualties on Everest.Then, in spring (March-May), DJI drones, which make sounds similar to a swarm of bees, will be put to work on Everest.It will fly to Camp I (5,943 metres) to supply ropes and ladders to prepare routes and bring garbage to the Everest base camp at 5,364 metres.On Sunday, a tripartite memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee, the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, and the Airlift Technology Pvt Ltd for the use of advanced drone technology to efficiently manage garbage in the mountains of the Khumbu region.In April, Chinese drone maker DJI conducted the worldâs first drone delivery test on Everest.âAfter a successful test in April, we plan to use drones commercially in the Everest region,â said Jagat Bhusal, chief administration officer of the rural municipality that hosts Everest. The test result showed that the DJI FlyCart 30, the long-distance heavy lifter drone, could airlift 234 kg per hour between Camp I and Base Camp, a task usually accomplished by at least 14 porters in six hours. Drone manufacturer DJI is under the microscope as US lawmakers push for a ban on Chinese drones, amid deteriorating relations between the US and China, the worldâs largest trading nations.Nepali officials and mountaineers, however, see the drone as a life-saving vehicle.Traditionally, local Sherpa guides are responsible for transporting supplies and clearing trash on Everest. They may need to cross the icefall over 30 times a season to transport supplies such as oxygen bottles, gas canisters, tents, food, and ropes.All climbers and guides must navigate the icefall on the route to the worldâs tallest peak. The icefall is so notoriously dangerous that even experienced Sherpas hesitate to move when the sun shines.The Khumbu Icefall, a river of ice a kilometre or so long, is usually crossed at night or early morning, with climbers putting headlamps on their helmets.Normally, the route is crossed early in the morning, when the ice blocks and the hanging glaciers are stable and avalanche risks are low.During the day, as the sun warms the mountain, the hanging glaciers melt, and ice crumbles, increasing the risk of avalanche.âUsing drones will help us avoid the dangers in the Khumbu Icefall,â said Bhusal. On April 18, 2014, an avalanche resulting from a falling serac buried 16 Sherpa guides in the Khumbu Icefall, eventually leading to the cancellation of the seasonâs expeditions.Last year, three Sherpa guides mobilised to prepare the routes were buried under the ice masses triggered by an avalanche in the Khumbu Icefall. Their bodies are yet to be recovered.The Himalayan Database and the government records show that nearly 50 individuals died on the icefall between 1953 and 2023.The climb from Everest Base Camp to Camp I takes six hours. Between these two camps lies the Khumbu Icefall, the most treacherous part of the route.The most exciting and easiest part of the route is reaching Camp II (6,400 metres), which takes four hours from Camp I.There is a set of restrictions in the mountains for carrying loads.According to government rules, workers climbing high altitudes must not carry loads exceeding 20kg between 5,000 and 6,000 metres, 17 kg between 6,001 and 7,000 metres, 14 kg between 7,001 to 8,000 metres, and 12 kg for altitudes above 8,000 metres.âYes, there are concerns that the machines may actually cut jobs. But our sole purpose is to reduce potential deaths in the Khumbu Icefall, the danger zone,â said Bhusal.âWe will train Sherpas, as drone operators cannot handle tasks at the higher camps. In the future, all work will be done by Sherpas.â In the trial phase, the drone could lift 30 kg from Camp I. However, its performance dropped to 18 kg from Camp II. âBased on the MoU framework, we will soon sign a commercial agreement with the drone supplier,â said Bhusal. âThe municipality will monitor all the activities.âThe municipality has, so far, spent Rs800,000 on the trial. Climate change is melting snow and ice, exposing even more garbage and bodies that have been covered for decades on Everest. This waste pollutes the natural environment and poses a severe health risk to everyone who lives in the Everest watershed.Nearly 100 tonnes of garbage were collected during this spring climbing season from Everest and Lhotse, which share the same base camp.According to the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee (SPCC), 77.19 tonnes of waste was collected from the Everest base camp alone during the Spring 2024 climbing season. With 8-9 tonnes coming from the higher camps brought down by the expedition agencies, the SPCC collected 85 tonnes of waste this spring.The breakdown of collected waste shows burnable garbage at 27.99 tonnes, recyclable garbage at 7.51 tonnes, human waste at 27.53 tonnes, and kitchen waste at 14.15 tonnes. The Nepal Army also collected over 11 tonnes of garbage. In Spring 2023, the SPCC managed nearly 70 tonnes of waste from expedition groups.Insiders say the Everest Base Camp has become more luxurious, leading to an accumulation of people and garbage. Nearly 60,000 people trek to the Base Camp annually.Since 2015, the SPCC has enforced the 8 kg garbage rule, requiring every climber ascending the Everest base camp to return with at least 8 kg of garbage. Visitors to Everest must also pay a $4,000 garbage deposit, which is refunded if the person returns with 8 kg.Before this yearâs climbing season, the Supreme Court issued a mandamus order directing the government to regulate the rising number of expeditions on the worldâs tallest mountain.The court order followed frequent traffic jams and increasing trash on Everest, which has even been called the âworld's highest garbage dumpâ.âDrones can replace helicopters as a relatively low-risk transport vehicle to supplement supplies on the plateau, which will greatly expand the application space of UAVs,â Cai Yong, a senior engineer at East China Normal University, told Xinhua, the state news agency of China, after the April test.In recent years, more electric drones have been used in agriculture and forestry, power line inspection, logistics, and emergency rescue, and each breakthrough will help save human and material resources and protect the safety of life and property, Jin Wei, deputy secretary-general of the China UAV Industry Innovation Alliance, told Xinhua.The April tests used the DJI FlyCart 30 to fly three bottles of oxygen and 1.5 kg of other supplies from the base camp to Camp I of the world's highest peak and to carry garbage down on the return trip.During the tests, the DJI FlyCart 30 flew up to 6,191.8 metres on Everest, which straddles the Nepal-China border.Â  ","summary":"Come autumn, Nepal will deploy heavy lifter drones to transport garbage from the 6,812-metre tall Ama Dablam, south of Everest.

The latest trade strategy is meant to support Nepal's graduation from the least developed country (LDC) status to a developing country by 2026.As per the statistics, export earnings from the goods identified by NTIS 2023 totalled Rs110.38 billion in the review period.Nepalâs total export amounted to Rs152.38 billion in the last fiscal year.The aim of NTIS 2023 is to diversify the export market for which a country-wise strategy was said to be prepared and implemented. But little has been done towards that end.âItâs true. Few works have been done for the implementation of the latest trade strategy and the result is not as expected,â said an official at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies requesting anonymity. There are problems in production, quality entrepreneurship development and global price competitiveness in the implementation of trade strategy. âWe have started consultation with the private sector and stakeholders since the beginning of the current fiscal year regarding the legal, resource and other aspects of effective implementation of a trade strategy in the current fiscal year,â said the official.The ministry has got a budget of Rs34.5 million for the implementation of NTIS in the current fiscal year. Officials said that budget constraint is one of the problems in the full implementation of the trade strategy.According to the latest NTIS estimation, around Rs463 billion will be required for its implementation.The major target of NTIS 2023 is to attain Nepalâs trade-to-GDP ratio of 55 percent by 2026 from 43.81 percent in 2021. Trade is the sum of exports and imports of goods and services measured as a share of the gross domestic product (GDP).Proper coordination among the ministries and government bodies concerned is crucial for an effective implementation of the trade strategy but in the lack of the coordination there is a problem in budget mobilisation.âThe development of entrepreneurship and its ecosystem from the private sector and increase in the governmentâs capital expenditure are also required to achieve the objective of NTIS.âTrade experts have been stressing for long that as Nepal is preparing to graduate from the âleast developedâ status by 2026, the increase in the export of high-value goods is not satisfactory which is not a good sign for the graduation.âThe performances of former NTIS-listed goods were not good, demonstrating that Nepal failed to develop the productsâ value chain. Making plans alone doesnât work if they are not properly executed,â said Purushottam Ojha, former commerce secretary and trade expert in a recent interview with the Post. âThere are problems in increasing and enhancing production, assuring quality and marketing Nepali products.âA major implication of LDC graduation is the loss of preferential market access available through LDC-specific schemes under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) and other arrangements.After LDC graduation, Nepal may lose a huge European market as it might not get facilities under the Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative. This scheme grants full duty-free and quota-free access to the European Union Single Market for all products (except arms and ammunition).There are around 184 activities for the implementation of the NTIS and provision requiring monitoring and evaluation. But the monitoring mechanism does not seem to have done its work, a trade expert said. There should be a dedicated review after a certain time gap, which helps focus on problematic issues.The export of iron and steel products, readymade garment, fabrics, medicinal herbs, cement, footwear, lentils, fruits, honey and textile, yarn and rope has increased in the last fiscal year.Shipment of iron and steel rose by 60 percent to Rs17.40 billion during the review period, making it top exportable goods from listed products. The export of iron and steel contributed 11.4 percent in total export share.Export of textile, yarn and rope increased by 30.09 percent to Rs19.22 billion contributing second largest export from Nepal. The export of textile, yarn and rope contributed 12.6 percent to the total export.Readymade garment export increased by 9.12 percent to Rs8.96 billion in the review period.The export of fabrics increased by 6.68 percent to Rs2.52 billion while medicinal herbs shipment increased by 19.27 percent to Rs2.25 billion.Cement shipment jumped by 449.05 percent to Rs1.97 billion during the review period. Footwear exports grew by 22.84 percent to Rs1.32 billion.Nepalâs lentils export increased by 14.12 percent to Rs568.47 million while fruits export jumped 517 percent to Rs19.02 million. The export of honey rose by 210.83 percent to Rs57.47 million.The exports of carpet, readymade garment, cardamom, jute and related products, felt products, dog food, pashmina, rosin and resin acid, ginger, handmade paper, silver and gold jewellery, vegetable, tea, coffee and spice fell in the last fiscal year compared to the previous one.Shipments of carpet from Nepal declined by 8.12 percent to Rs10.57 billion while cardamom export declined by 4.06 percent to Rs7.94 billion.Exports of jute and processed goods fell by 7.86 percent to Rs7.04 billion.Shipment of felt products dropped by 8.18 percent to Rs4.79 billion in the review period.Dog chew export came down by 6.59 percent to Rs3.18 billion in the last fiscal year.

Trade is the sum of exports and imports of goods and services measured as a share of the gross domestic product (GDP).Proper coordination among the ministries and government bodies concerned is crucial for an effective implementation of the trade strategy but in the lack of the coordination there is a problem in budget mobilisation.âThe development of entrepreneurship and its ecosystem from the private sector and increase in the governmentâs capital expenditure are also required to achieve the objective of NTIS.âTrade experts have been stressing for long that as Nepal is preparing to graduate from the âleast developedâ status by 2026, the increase in the export of high-value goods is not satisfactory which is not a good sign for the graduation.âThe performances of former NTIS-listed goods were not good, demonstrating that Nepal failed to develop the productsâ value chain. Making plans alone doesnât work if they are not properly executed,â said Purushottam Ojha, former commerce secretary and trade expert in a recent interview with the Post. âThere are problems in increasing and enhancing production, assuring quality and marketing Nepali products.âA major implication of LDC graduation is the loss of preferential market access available through LDC-specific schemes under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) and other arrangements.After LDC graduation, Nepal may lose a huge European market as it might not get facilities under the Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative. This scheme grants full duty-free and quota-free access to the European Union Single Market for all products (except arms and ammunition).There are around 184 activities for the implementation of the NTIS and provision requiring monitoring and evaluation. But the monitoring mechanism does not seem to have done its work, a trade expert said. There should be a dedicated review after a certain time gap, which helps focus on problematic issues.The export of iron and steel products, readymade garment, fabrics, medicinal herbs, cement, footwear, lentils, fruits, honey and textile, yarn and rope has increased in the last fiscal year.Shipment of iron and steel rose by 60 percent to Rs17.40 billion during the review period, making it top exportable goods from listed products. The export of iron and steel contributed 11.4 percent in total export share.Export of textile, yarn and rope increased by 30.09 percent to Rs19.22 billion contributing second largest export from Nepal. The export of textile, yarn and rope contributed 12.6 percent to the total export.Readymade garment export increased by 9.12 percent to Rs8.96 billion in the review period.The export of fabrics increased by 6.68 percent to Rs2.52 billion while medicinal herbs shipment increased by 19.27 percent to Rs2.25 billion.Cement shipment jumped by 449.05 percent to Rs1.97 billion during the review period. Footwear exports grew by 22.84 percent to Rs1.32 billion.Nepalâs lentils export increased by 14.12 percent to Rs568.47 million while fruits export jumped 517 percent to Rs19.02 million. The export of honey rose by 210.83 percent to Rs57.47 million.The exports of carpet, readymade garment, cardamom, jute and related products, felt products, dog food, pashmina, rosin and resin acid, ginger, handmade paper, silver and gold jewellery, vegetable, tea, coffee and spice fell in the last fiscal year compared to the previous one.Shipments of carpet from Nepal declined by 8.12 percent to Rs10.57 billion while cardamom export declined by 4.06 percent to Rs7.94 billion.Exports of jute and processed goods fell by 7.86 percent to Rs7.04 billion.Shipment of felt products dropped by 8.18 percent to Rs4.79 billion in the review period.Dog chew export came down by 6.59 percent to Rs3.18 billion in the last fiscal year. Shipment of pashmina also fell 5.32 percent to Rs3.02 billion.Export of rosin and resin acids declined by 10.51 percent to Rs1.47 billion. Shipment of Nepali paper declined by 10.18 percent to Rs1.02 billion.Gold and silver jewellery exports declined by 69.14 percent and 22.39 respectively to Rs58.23 million and Rs167.05 million accordingly.Nepalâs tea, coffee and spice exports shrank by 4.48 percent to Rs13.44 billion.Shipment of pasta fell by 14.38 percent to Rs1.96 billion during the review period.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishraâs early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, âThe Sewing Tinâ, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Postâs Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. Itâs been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdainâs groundbreaking book, âKitchen Confidentialâ, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorousâit involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of âThe Sewing Tinâ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staffâeconomic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriersâI had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at âJunoonâ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant âThe Sewing Tinâ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.âThe Sewing Tinâ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing suppliesâsomething uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?Iâm on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But Iâm still learning and want to explore more of Nepalâs cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because itâs got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.Iâve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their foodâitâs like theyâre sharing a story. Theyâve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. Itâs okay to give helpful advice but donât be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldnât also just copy whatâs popular, they should cook what they truly love. Thatâs what makes food special and meaningful.Mishraâs signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve "},{"hash":"4f18229de2a5d8016e8888758de34cc858e98af2b542ed3077fa8ab2d1e49a3b","title":"patience-passion-and-pastries","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/recipes/2024/04/27/patience-passion-and-pastries","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/BakeleusbyCeleus-1714186343.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1714176000000,"source":"kp","category":"recipes","content":"Celeus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.âYou can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,â says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow Houseâs Night Market. Bakeleusâs menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. âThis connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,â she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility.

","summary":"Celeus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.âYou can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,â says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow Houseâs Night Market. Bakeleusâs menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. âThis connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,â she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility.

Yet, pockets of the past remainâsmall, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in todayâs Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hourâs walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokanaâs historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the âKhokana Museumâ. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the areaâs history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean waterâa practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.Â  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot âAbout Dry Grassesâ, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happeningâto what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say âlifeâs turning point?â How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.âHow much oxygen do you need for the summit?â sounds more like âHow much do you need to hold on to life?â How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, âIs this journey worth this much?âI had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my fatherâs memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered natureâs masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like âHow will I endure?â and âHow will I finish?â started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of âGodsâ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just thereâbefore and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled âMy Soul Beyond the Mountainâ.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. ","summary":"âHow much oxygen do you have for the summit?âI think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot âAbout Dry Grassesâ, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happeningâto what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say âlifeâs turning point?â How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.âHow much oxygen do you need for the summit?â sounds more like âHow much do you need to hold on to life?â How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, âIs this journey worth this much?âI had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my fatherâs memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered natureâs masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like âHow will I endure?â and âHow will I finish?â started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of âGodsâ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just thereâbefore and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colomboâs Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resortâs expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the islandâs famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lionâs Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. âThatâs a better figure now as we are recovering.âThe travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the UkraineâRussia war, and Chinaâs zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the countryâs GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the worldâs best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.âTourism is gaining momentum,â says Somasiri. âThe British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.âJanuary-August is the peak season for foreigners. âFrom December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,â says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, âDon't take selfies with your back to Buddha.â Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.âThese infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the countryâs dry zone,â says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrewâs, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lankaâs hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as âLittle Englandâ. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sitaâs whereabouts.In Ella, Ravanaâs waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasnât crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galleâs 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.âThe main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,â says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.âWe have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,â added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. âWe have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,â says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.âThe other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,â says Pathirana.

However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.âThe main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,â says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.âWe have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,â added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. âWe have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,â says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.âThe other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,â says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki MandirâJanaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earthâthe Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10Â°c to 20Â°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the worldâs third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the schoolâto quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. Itâs the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leaderâs birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidimâs lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldnât help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughterâsymbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932â1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interestsâas a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimesâgambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?âI remember once seeing a small board that read âJawalakhel Zoological Gardenâ,â Koirala says. âI donât know whether it was from Juddhaâs time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.âKoirala adds, âThere is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddhaâs time.âBirds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepalâs rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepalâs royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book âSocial History of Nepalâ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapurâs King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipurâs King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained âtiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deerâ¦ heron, peacockâ¦ pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.âJung Bahadur Ranaâs zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to âsupervise and inspect itâ. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddhaâs biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in âThe Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Ranaâ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmanduâs Rana community including Juddhaâs descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, SchÃ¶nbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the worldâs first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddhaâs inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled âCentral zoo in state of neglectâ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day âreceived a pair of leopards as a giftâ, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report âCentral Zoo Master Planâ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals âincluding deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmanduâ could be put into one compound in the âlonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhariâ.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patanâs King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zooâs layoutâexcept for the small plots of lands acquired laterâthat was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddhaâs zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosuresâthe southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddhaâs zoo house?âWe cannot tell for sure,â Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.âIn those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,â Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monalâfrom the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddhaâs zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shresthaâs account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungleâs kingâcreatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as giftsâappearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsherâs âShree Teen Juddha Mahimaâ published during Juddhaâs reign in 1943.âOne need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,â he writes. âIt will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.âAmong these incredible creatures, one reigned supremeâlion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungleâs king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddhaâs zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.âWhere bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,â Koirala says. âThese were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.âNear these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddhaâs place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zooâs entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddhaâs elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumariâs enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumariâs statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumariâs statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhelâs most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.âOn June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbarâ¦ the pond nearby looked very scenic,â says a Gorkhapatra news report titled âStatue installationâ dated July 5, 1935. âBecause it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranathâ¦ and moreover since an ideal womanâs statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.âLess than fifty metres from Karma Kumariâs statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zooâs meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zooâs lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?âI think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,â Subodh Rana said. âIt is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.âFor one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one âneed not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countriesâ suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatarsâa neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lionâs roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world cameâcreatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each otherâs joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddhaâs Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddhaâs Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. ","summary":"What animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?âWe only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,â says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. âThat too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.âToday, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the worldâfrom tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932â1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interestsâas a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimesâgambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?âI remember once seeing a small board that read âJawalakhel Zoological Gardenâ,â Koirala says. âI donât know whether it was from Juddhaâs time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.âKoirala adds, âThere is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddhaâs time.âBirds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepalâs rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepalâs royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book âSocial History of Nepalâ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapurâs King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipurâs King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained âtiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deerâ¦ heron, peacockâ¦ pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.âJung Bahadur Ranaâs zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to âsupervise and inspect itâ. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddhaâs biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in âThe Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Ranaâ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmanduâs Rana community including Juddhaâs descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, SchÃ¶nbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the worldâs first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddhaâs inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled âCentral zoo in state of neglectâ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day âreceived a pair of leopards as a giftâ, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report âCentral Zoo Master Planâ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals âincluding deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmanduâ could be put into one compound in the âlonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhariâ.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patanâs King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zooâs layoutâexcept for the small plots of lands acquired laterâthat was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddhaâs zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosuresâthe southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddhaâs zoo house?âWe cannot tell for sure,â Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.âIn those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,â Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monalâfrom the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddhaâs zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shresthaâs account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungleâs kingâcreatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as giftsâappearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsherâs âShree Teen Juddha Mahimaâ published during Juddhaâs reign in 1943.âOne need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,â he writes. âIt will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.âAmong these incredible creatures, one reigned supremeâlion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungleâs king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddhaâs zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.âWhere bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,â Koirala says. âThese were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.âNear these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddhaâs place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zooâs entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddhaâs elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumariâs enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumariâs statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumariâs statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhelâs most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.âOn June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbarâ¦ the pond nearby looked very scenic,â says a Gorkhapatra news report titled âStatue installationâ dated July 5, 1935. âBecause it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranathâ¦ and moreover since an ideal womanâs statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.âLess than fifty metres from Karma Kumariâs statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zooâs meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zooâs lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?âI think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,â Subodh Rana said. âIt is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.âFor one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one âneed not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countriesâ suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. âAll books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,â Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. âI donât know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.âTranslating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepalâs book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the whoâs who of the world literature. Such endeavours havenât just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. âThese translations are poor,â Baral says. âTomes with 1200â1300 pages have been trimmed to 200â300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.âAnother popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.âWe have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,â Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The bookâs Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: âAchyut Koirala, who has a masterâs in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.âKoirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasnât just translated the book but has also done âcreative writingâ with it.âRich Dad Poor Dadâ, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books thatâs perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the bookâall unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, âAt this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.âBasanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. âBut how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!â Thapa wonders. âReaders who havenât read the original wouldnât know the faults in the translated versions.â Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ârecreateâ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslimaâs books are the major victimsTaslimaâs memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as âSangharshaâ, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the bookâs sequel as âPrem ra Jeevanâ. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslimaâs permission. âAbout a decade back, we didnât know how to ask for permission,â he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody elseâs work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslimaâs anthology of essays No Country for Women as âAaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhainaâ. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. âI have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,â Pradhan, who is also a childrenâs book writer, says. âI just copy-edited it upon request.âBishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. âWe translated the book long ago,â he says. âWe are still trying to get translation rights.âIndigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrarâs Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. âAfter I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,â Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Kheraâs You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the bookâs unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they donât even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that itâd be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the authorâs permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldnât demand much for translation rights given Nepalâs small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. âPublishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,â he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harariâs bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the bookâs translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguruâs Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. âThis phenomenon not just hampers Nepalâs fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the countryâs reputation in the global market,â Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. âWe donât have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,â he says. âNobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.â Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.Oneâs pain, anotherâs pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, âThis is a pirated copy and Iâm the author of this book.â The youth wasnât bothered and replied, âOkay, you can buy it at a discount.âThis anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehtaâs friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. âWe sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,â says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepalâs image internationally. âThere was a time when Bangladesh would be known as âpiracy kingâ,â he said. âNow there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.âAs tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.âAfter the governmentâs decision, we stopped importing books for a while,â says Shrestha of Education Books. âThe import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.âPirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesnât levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. âThe government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the countryâs economy as well,â he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House Indiaâs sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. âTo confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,â Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, âKeeping ISBN number at oneâs will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.âBy the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrarâs office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Actâs clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Actâs subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Actâs clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. âAll books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,â Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. âI donât know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.âTranslating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepalâs book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the whoâs who of the world literature. Such endeavours havenât just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. âThese translations are poor,â Baral says. âTomes with 1200â1300 pages have been trimmed to 200â300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.âAnother popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.âWe have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,â Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The bookâs Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: âAchyut Koirala, who has a masterâs in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.âKoirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasnât just translated the book but has also done âcreative writingâ with it.âRich Dad Poor Dadâ, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books thatâs perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the bookâall unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, âAt this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.âBasanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. âBut how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!â Thapa wonders. âReaders who havenât read the original wouldnât know the faults in the translated versions.â Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ârecreateâ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslimaâs books are the major victimsTaslimaâs memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as âSangharshaâ, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the bookâs sequel as âPrem ra Jeevanâ. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslimaâs permission. âAbout a decade back, we didnât know how to ask for permission,â he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody elseâs work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslimaâs anthology of essays No Country for Women as âAaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhainaâ. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. âI have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,â Pradhan, who is also a childrenâs book writer, says. âI just copy-edited it upon request.âBishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. âWe translated the book long ago,â he says. âWe are still trying to get translation rights.âIndigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrarâs Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. âAfter I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,â Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Kheraâs You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the bookâs unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they donât even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that itâd be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the authorâs permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldnât demand much for translation rights given Nepalâs small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. âPublishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,â he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harariâs bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the bookâs translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguruâs Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. âThis phenomenon not just hampers Nepalâs fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the countryâs reputation in the global market,â Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. âWe donât have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,â he says. âNobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.â Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.Oneâs pain, anotherâs pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, âThis is a pirated copy and Iâm the author of this book.â The youth wasnât bothered and replied, âOkay, you can buy it at a discount.âThis anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehtaâs friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. âWe sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,â says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepalâs image internationally. âThere was a time when Bangladesh would be known as âpiracy kingâ,â he said. âNow there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.âAs tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.âAfter the governmentâs decision, we stopped importing books for a while,â says Shrestha of Education Books. âThe import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.âPirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesnât levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. âThe government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the countryâs economy as well,â he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House Indiaâs sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. âTo confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,â Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, âKeeping ISBN number at oneâs will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.âBy the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrarâs office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Actâs clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Actâs subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Actâs clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the âimportation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.âIf anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provisionâs implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. âCreation is a crucial part of humanityâs benefit,â he says. âIf intellectual property is not protected effectively, then thereâd be no inspiration to create something.âBal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.âIn the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,â Mukhiya says. âBut in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.â(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum Eastâa close-knit settlement of 425 housesâwas considered the Maoistsâ âbase areaâ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. âYouths started going to America about six-seven years ago,â he said. âIf they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.â Budhaâs own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the USâa country that the Maoists used to call their âenemyâ, an âimperialistic forceâ. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditorsâ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. âAfter the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldnât live in the village peacefully,â said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, âWhen will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!âDhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. âNow we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlalâs trip abroad],â Nanda Kala said. âThereâs no point staying here.âStories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. âItâs not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,â he said. âI aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.âFor six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. âWhen I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,â he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupakâs wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.âI still donât know what exactly happened,â said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupakâs trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, âI only have memories.âLack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, âWorkers of the world, unite!â, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, thereâs nothing he can do. âHow could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?â he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didnât herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. âMeter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,â he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dangâs Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. âOnly those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,â he said.One can infer from Pandeyâs statements that the families of such illegal travellers donât want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesnât include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the âbase areasâ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. âThis is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,â Shrestha said. âThe Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.â Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgencyâs âbase areasâ is due to the political systemâs abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. âThe traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,â he said. âDevelopments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.â(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

Rupakâs wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.âI still donât know what exactly happened,â said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupakâs trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, âI only have memories.âLack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, âWorkers of the world, unite!â, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, thereâs nothing he can do. âHow could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?â he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didnât herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. âMeter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,â he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dangâs Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. âOnly those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,â he said.One can infer from Pandeyâs statements that the families of such illegal travellers donât want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesnât include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the âbase areasâ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. âThis is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,â Shrestha said. âThe Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.â Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgencyâs âbase areasâ is due to the political systemâs abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. âThe traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,â he said. âDevelopments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.â(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

Upper castes are generally blamed for committing crimes against Dalits, but it is not exclusive to them.

He said, âIâm a criminal of history.

The fact that they continue to humiliate and attack Dalits even now should deeply concern them. Itâs also time they realised their grave mistake of excluding Dalits from their movements, which peaked in the late 1990s and included them in their fight against Brahmanism. Dalits themselves recognise many differences between their issues and those of ethnic minorities; however, in reality, there are many overlaps. For one thing, in the eyes of the so-called high-caste Hindu, even ethnic minorities are low-caste Shudra; they, too, are denied the sacred thread and treated as untouchable. Upper castes, mainly orthodox Hindus, donât accept rice prepared by members of ethnic communities. High castes wouldnât normally marry ethnic minorities, and even if they did, the latter would face certain restrictions, mainly in the religious and spiritual sphere. An ethnic woman married to an upper caste may be barred from worshipping the lineage deities, for example.Not to mention, thanks to the extensive Hinduisation of ethnic groups over the years, thereâs a degree of caste hierarchy practised within and amongst those communities as well. The Gurung wouldnât marry a Tamang, for example, as the latter has been placed only slightly above the Dalit on the scale of ritual pollution. If the ethnic activists had brought Dalits on boardâor at least forged a strong alliance with themâtheir movements would have become larger and stronger. In the meantime, their populace would probably have been educated about the fallacy and inhumanity associated with the Dalit exclusion. Members of ethnic communities would have learnt that the rejection of caste hierarchy also implies the termination of ritual hierarchy altogether. Thus, the behaviour of these ethnic groups towards Dalits would have hopefully changed quite drastically by now. Ethnic leaders and activists not only excluded Dalits from their movements but also didnât talk about ending untouchability. They were keen on toppling the Bahun hegemony and separating and suppressing the Dalits. This has been a big failure of ethnic and indigenous identity politics so far. Proponents of ethnic identity should now see this drawback, as Gopal Kiranti seems to have done, and try to bring Dalits along with them. The Front for Identity, led by Prof Lawoti, appears keen to move in this direction. Identity: Horizontal versus vertical In a highly caste-ridden society like ours, the issues of collective identity and individual freedom seem conflicting. Ethnic politics does reify and solidify group boundaries. Ethnic groups are eager to highlight and bolster those inter-group boundaries, whereas Dalits want to dissolve those boundaries once and for all. How do we conceptually overcome this apparent mismatch?Notably, ethnic groups are horizontally arrangedâlong-term Hinduisation and caste-ification notwithstanding. They are culturally separate but, by and large, equal in status hierarchy. Thereâs much equality in how these groups interact with each other. Ethnic activists are keen to preserve and promote this horizontal separation.This doesnât necessarily hurt Dalitsâ quest for equality because they want to dismantle the vertical hierarchy and arrange themselves horizontally. They donât want the statuses to be conceived as big and small, high and low, top and bottom, pure and impure. This explains why many Dalits hate the caste system while loving their caste identities. Dalit caste associations arenât as big and influential as ethnic associations, yet they have been an important part of the Dalit movement for decades.Once people understand the difference between these two sets of identities arranged horizontally and vertically, the ethnic and Dalit movements can coalesce. This way, ethnic and Dalit campaigners can find common ground and struggle together. This should be the new way forward to accelerate societal change.

Both Pakistanâs authoritarians and activists should ensure that digital deployments do not exacerbate gender discrimination in our country.Talk of tech is by default optimistic, and marginalised groups have overall benefited from digital technology, whether through finding online communities of like-minded souls or accessing information and services previously denied to them. The greatest threat to this digital empowerment remains access: Pakistanâs digital gender gap is severe, with 26 percent of women accessing the internet as compared to 47pc of men.While internet infrastructure is often posited as the solution to access gaps, the Amnesty report emphasises that the persistence of patriarchal structures in the digital realm means that discrimination endures even where infrastructure becomes available. One reason for this is the datafication of our lives. To exist in the 21st century, you need a data profile. And this profile is born from digital identity cards, online credit histories, e-bills to physical addresses, and yes, unfettered internet access. These are all things routinely denied to marginalised groups, particularly women, in the offline world. Any new digital regulation that prioritises security considerations over inclusion would be doing a disservice to the Pakistani people.Data collection is also inherently discriminatory. The approach is often rooted in existing structural inequality, rendering marginalised groups invisible online as well. The Amnesty report points to digital identity systems as a key example of this. Think of our own national identity cards that require identification in the context of patriarchal family structures. Nadra is specifically called out in the report for deciding in 2023 to temporarily suspend the option for individuals to identify as âXâ in the gender category, leaving many transgender people without digital identification and so without access to other social services.Of course, with more inclusive data profiles comes a greater need for data protection and privacy. For marginalised groups, datafication also means enhanced vulnerability. Such groups may go online to access information or services that are sensitive or stigmatised (for example, information about reproductive health). The ability to freely access and share information and services without fear of surveillance should be respected as a core human right.There is also a gendered aspect to the economic opportunities that digitisation offers. The Pakistani debate on technology has become entirely securitised. But digital access is also about finding jobs in the gig economy, availing the benefits of digital entrepreneurship and ensuring that contract workers are fairly compensated by non-transparent algorithms. In all these arenas, women are at higher risk of reduced access to opportunity, discriminatory wages and oppressive workplace surveillance.

How it will be judged in months and quarters to come remains to be seen. For now, the stock market has spoken. The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE), which had already been rallying feverishly since early July, surged by 4.4 percent on July 28âthe first day of trading after the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the countryâs central bank, published the policy on July 26. The NRB has drawn accolades for adopting an expansionary policy. It lowered the benchmark interest rates, scrapped the Rs200 million margin-loan cap for institutional investors and reduced provisioning requirement for banks, among others.Stocks particularly reacted to the removal of the margin-loan ceiling for institutional investors. A brief history is in order: Three years ago, the 2021-22 monetary policy limited margin loan per customer to Rs40 million at one bank and Rs120 million at multiple banks. The NRB aimed to rein in the prevailing massive investor speculation back then. Soon after, the NEPSE tagged 3,227 in August 2021 and headed lower. The snorting bulls were up in arms and put all kinds of pressure on the Maha Prasad Adhikari-led central bank to roll back the cap, to no avail. Last October, the Rs120 million ceiling was upped to Rs150 million for individual investors and Rs200 million for institutional investors. Fast forward to now, and the cap for individual investors remains, but a limit no longer binds institutional investors. They can borrow as much as they wish. The NEPSE shot up by 35.5 percent in July to reach 2,761. Earlier, soon after it peaked in August 2021, it was rangebound between 1,800 and 2,200 before it broke out in the middle of last month. The July move looks parabolic, but volume is fully cooperating. As of mid-June, banks and financial institutions (20 commercial banks, 17 development banks and 17 finance companies) held Rs87.1 billion in margin loans, up from Rs76.5 billion as of mid-July last year. It is safe to assume that the latest monetary policy will embolden investors to take on additional leverage.Setting bad precedent Leaving aside the fact that leverage cuts both ways and contractions in leverage will hurt stocks, the current market momentum is up, and leverage can be beneficial. The NRB should closely monitor how the current bull will evolve and what kind of speculative mania this will spawn. Three years ago, the NEPSE continued to rise non-stop for over two years before it reached a record in August 2021. More important is whether the NRB leadership will have the willingness and the courage to tackle a scenario in which excessive leverage risks hurting investors and/or the economy. In this regard, Governor Adhikari withstood undue pressure from even former finance ministers who wanted looser margin-lending rules.Yuba Raj Khatiwada, the current economic adviser to Prime Minister KP Oli and former NRB governor, vice chairman of the National Planning Commission as well as finance minister, was one of several former finance ministers to openly call on the NRB to remove the margin-loan cap last year. Whether last monthâs lifting of the Rs200 million cap for institutional investors was done at the sole discretion of the central bank or Khatiwada had a hand in it, we donât know. This much we do know: The monetary policy, originally scheduled to come out on July 19, was delayed by a whole week. Apparently, on July 18, Khatiwada wanted to study the policy and borrowed it, causing the dillydally. This sets a bad precedent.According to the Nepal Rastra Bank Act 2002, (1) The objectives of the bank are (i) To formulate and manage monetary and foreign exchange policies in order to maintain price and balance of payment stability for the achievement of economic stability and sustainable development of the economy; (ii) To raise public confidence towards the banking and financial system by making the sectors stable and by increasing access to financial services; (iii) To develop a secure, healthy and efficient payment system. (2) The bank, without any prejudice to the objectives referred to in subsection 1, will extend cooperation in the implementation of economic policies of the government of Nepal.Restore central bank credibilityThe Act also states that the bank shall be an autonomous and corporate body with perpetual succession. Sub-section 2 nonetheless creates room for government intervention, particularly considering that the bankâs seven-member board of directors comprises the governor, two deputy governors, secretary at the Ministry of Finance and three others appointed by the government. If the newly appointed prime minister wanted to review the monetary policy, he should have done so via Finance Minister Bishnu Poudel. The Act states that any contact between the bank and the government should be made through the Ministry of Finance. It was wrong for Khatiwada to interject himself into this.Internal politics within the Oli-led NPC-UML may have played a role. Bishnu Poudel is the party's vice-chairman, while Shanker Pokharel is the general secretary. The two locked horns in July, trying to instil their loyal for the position of chief minister of Lumbini Province. In the end, with Oliâs blessing, Pokharelâs candidate won. It is logical to assume that Poudel and Khatiwada have different priorities for handling the stock market/economy. This, however, cannot justify Khatiwadaâs intervention. The optics are jarring. Good governance, the rule of law and the end of corruption are some catchphrases thrown around in the Oli-led coalition government. Khatiwadaâs faux pas is anything but good governance.Central banks live or die by credibility. The NRBâs primary responsibility is to carry out monetary policy. Fiscal policy falls under the purview of the government. By nature, politicians are driven by the next election cycle and would like good thingsâsuch as rising stock pricesâto unfold during their time in power. In contrast, the NRB, as a regulator, cannot and should not wish for higher or lower prices; rather, it should focus on creating a durable investing environment. Bringing out a monetary policy a week later than the scheduled time does not help boost the confidence of foreign investors, largely because this was due to government intervention. Let the âindependentâ NRB stay independent. ","summary":"The instant reaction to the Monetary Policy for Fiscal Year 2024-25 has been celebratory for the most part.

The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE), which had already been rallying feverishly since early July, surged by 4.4 percent on July 28âthe first day of trading after the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the countryâs central bank, published the policy on July 26. The NRB has drawn accolades for adopting an expansionary policy. It lowered the benchmark interest rates, scrapped the Rs200 million margin-loan cap for institutional investors and reduced provisioning requirement for banks, among others.Stocks particularly reacted to the removal of the margin-loan ceiling for institutional investors. A brief history is in order: Three years ago, the 2021-22 monetary policy limited margin loan per customer to Rs40 million at one bank and Rs120 million at multiple banks. The NRB aimed to rein in the prevailing massive investor speculation back then. Soon after, the NEPSE tagged 3,227 in August 2021 and headed lower. The snorting bulls were up in arms and put all kinds of pressure on the Maha Prasad Adhikari-led central bank to roll back the cap, to no avail. Last October, the Rs120 million ceiling was upped to Rs150 million for individual investors and Rs200 million for institutional investors. Fast forward to now, and the cap for individual investors remains, but a limit no longer binds institutional investors. They can borrow as much as they wish. The NEPSE shot up by 35.5 percent in July to reach 2,761. Earlier, soon after it peaked in August 2021, it was rangebound between 1,800 and 2,200 before it broke out in the middle of last month. The July move looks parabolic, but volume is fully cooperating. As of mid-June, banks and financial institutions (20 commercial banks, 17 development banks and 17 finance companies) held Rs87.1 billion in margin loans, up from Rs76.5 billion as of mid-July last year. It is safe to assume that the latest monetary policy will embolden investors to take on additional leverage.Setting bad precedent Leaving aside the fact that leverage cuts both ways and contractions in leverage will hurt stocks, the current market momentum is up, and leverage can be beneficial. The NRB should closely monitor how the current bull will evolve and what kind of speculative mania this will spawn. Three years ago, the NEPSE continued to rise non-stop for over two years before it reached a record in August 2021. More important is whether the NRB leadership will have the willingness and the courage to tackle a scenario in which excessive leverage risks hurting investors and/or the economy. In this regard, Governor Adhikari withstood undue pressure from even former finance ministers who wanted looser margin-lending rules.Yuba Raj Khatiwada, the current economic adviser to Prime Minister KP Oli and former NRB governor, vice chairman of the National Planning Commission as well as finance minister, was one of several former finance ministers to openly call on the NRB to remove the margin-loan cap last year. Whether last monthâs lifting of the Rs200 million cap for institutional investors was done at the sole discretion of the central bank or Khatiwada had a hand in it, we donât know. This much we do know: The monetary policy, originally scheduled to come out on July 19, was delayed by a whole week. Apparently, on July 18, Khatiwada wanted to study the policy and borrowed it, causing the dillydally. This sets a bad precedent.According to the Nepal Rastra Bank Act 2002, (1) The objectives of the bank are (i) To formulate and manage monetary and foreign exchange policies in order to maintain price and balance of payment stability for the achievement of economic stability and sustainable development of the economy; (ii) To raise public confidence towards the banking and financial system by making the sectors stable and by increasing access to financial services; (iii) To develop a secure, healthy and efficient payment system. (2) The bank, without any prejudice to the objectives referred to in subsection 1, will extend cooperation in the implementation of economic policies of the government of Nepal.Restore central bank credibilityThe Act also states that the bank shall be an autonomous and corporate body with perpetual succession. Sub-section 2 nonetheless creates room for government intervention, particularly considering that the bankâs seven-member board of directors comprises the governor, two deputy governors, secretary at the Ministry of Finance and three others appointed by the government. If the newly appointed prime minister wanted to review the monetary policy, he should have done so via Finance Minister Bishnu Poudel. The Act states that any contact between the bank and the government should be made through the Ministry of Finance. It was wrong for Khatiwada to interject himself into this.Internal politics within the Oli-led NPC-UML may have played a role. Bishnu Poudel is the party's vice-chairman, while Shanker Pokharel is the general secretary. The two locked horns in July, trying to instil their loyal for the position of chief minister of Lumbini Province. In the end, with Oliâs blessing, Pokharelâs candidate won. It is logical to assume that Poudel and Khatiwada have different priorities for handling the stock market/economy. This, however, cannot justify Khatiwadaâs intervention. The optics are jarring. Good governance, the rule of law and the end of corruption are some catchphrases thrown around in the Oli-led coalition government. Khatiwadaâs faux pas is anything but good governance.Central banks live or die by credibility. The NRBâs primary responsibility is to carry out monetary policy. Fiscal policy falls under the purview of the government. By nature, politicians are driven by the next election cycle and would like good thingsâsuch as rising stock pricesâto unfold during their time in power. In contrast, the NRB, as a regulator, cannot and should not wish for higher or lower prices; rather, it should focus on creating a durable investing environment. Bringing out a monetary policy a week later than the scheduled time does not help boost the confidence of foreign investors, largely because this was due to government intervention. Let the âindependentâ NRB stay independent.

He has studied and written extensively on water resources, trans-boundary water cooperation, flood management, wash services and climate change adaptation, clean energy transition and related policy studies. In this interview with the Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal, Dixit discusses river management in Nepalâs urban areas: Where have we gone wrong in this endeavour and what can we do? You have extensively studied river systems and have been following changes seen in river basins. How do you see recent problems caused by encroachment and rampant development activities?We humans have lived and have to continue to live within water cycles: water evaporates from the ocean to the sky and then precipitates to the land and flows via rivers back to the ocean. Rivers that function as arteries of the land surface, sustaining humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems face widespread abuses: pollution, rampant extraction of their bed and banks, fragmentation and degradation. Without rivers, we would not be who we are. Unfortunately, we have forgotten this essence. We neglect and abuse rivers. In 1981, just after the monsoon ended, I, along with my students, walked from Sundarijal to Teku studying Bagmati riversâ sediment. At many places, we walked on the riverbed. The river then was clean. Gradually, the river systems began to face all-round decay. I have read painful accounts of my contemporaries who remember swimming in the clean Bagmati and its tributaries. In less than 50 years, our rivers in Kathmandu Valley and other basins no longer look like rivers. I feel helpless and ache with pain at this collective failure! What state of rivers are we passing on to our next generation?River encroachment is common across Nepal but more serious in urban areas, including in Kathmandu. How can this be stopped?Our approach to rivers is an imitation of the trend common across South Asia, or the subcontinent, which is again largely based on the knowledge system developed in the industrialised Global North without contextualising locally. The region features waterscapes of high and punctuated rainfall during the monsoon months, rivers, wetlands, ponds, and springs, all connected with groundwater aquifers in one of the most complex landscapes of the world: the Himalaya-Ganga region. Yet, current development endeavours subjugate water rather than respect and live with it. In 2022, the Indus River in Pakistan faced major floods with devastating consequences. Referring to these floods, a group of global scientists stated that âthe impacts [of the floods] were the outcome of an outdated river management system.â This approach is primarily based on building of physical structures such as buildings, bridges and roads close to rivers interfering with their natural flows. The approach that began in the early twentieth century keeps marching on even while we are facing twenty first century water challenges.There is an increasing trend of building corridor roads along the rivers in Kathmandu as well as other places. Is this a good or bad practice? In Nepal, road building in the hills has earned the sobriquet of âdozer roads,â meaning politically designed roads excavated by heavy machine operators without adhering to basic engineering, social, environmental, or hydrological safeguards. Even highways built with âengineering,â such as the Mugling-Narayanghat section, face regular accidents. The sliding of the two buses in the Trishuli is the recent example. Building roads along the banks of rivers, defined as âriver corridors,â is the preferred approach for improving connectivity. In the Kathmandu Valley, this is also associated with rivers shackled within concrete walls in the name of river beautification. In the monsoon, however, they all overflow as we have been seeing in the last few years and this year as well.What will happen to these rivers 10-15 years down the line? Is there any chance of some of our rivers dying? Or, will the measures taken in recent times protect them?All rivers must flow clean and free in selected stretches. But today, rivers are disconnected with their floodplains. Within walls and embankments, they have become conduits of filth. Many rivers are already seriously degraded. If the current trend continues, many rivers may die. I remember Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, filmmaker, and author, who wrote: âWater and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.â Our current efforts at conserving, developing and managing rivers are grossly inadequate. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw some rivers heal as human actions across the board ceased due to the lockdown. But this healing came at huge human and economic costs. The lessons, however, are clear. We must stop turning rivers into garbage cans for them to begin to heal. The onus lies on us, our activities, our governance, and the policies we make and put into practice effectively. We need new ways of imagining rivers in harmony with human needs. Otherwise, the rivers will die. If rivers die, what will become of us?What problems may city dwellers face as a result of this continued destruction of rivers?A 2020 analysis of rivers in Nepal found that the quality of rivers in the mid-hills and the Tarai are already deteriorating. Industries, cities, towns, and agriculture produce waste that, when disposed of in rivers untreated, cause pollution. Solid and liquid wastes produced by expanding cities and towns pollute nearby rivers, streams, and water bodies. Pollution kills aquatic life such as fish, which are sources of livelihood for many communities. Polluted rivers and water bodies degrade human and environmental health, leading to negative impacts on human livelihoods. The impacts of pollution on rivers are considerable during non-monsoon months when river discharge, and consequently the capacity of rivers to dilute waste, are low.What should be done to conserve the rivers, at least in the present form, and stop further damages?All rivers are a combination of water (W), energy (E), biodiversity aquatic (B), and sediment (S), represented by the acronym WEBS. In the current scheme of things, the focus is on water and energy. Aquatic ecosystems are the concern of only those working on freshwater ecosystems. They are neglected in the larger context though the state has made some provisions for conserving ecosystems. In Nepalâs Hydropower Development Policy of 2001 all hydropower plants must release 10 percent minimum flow to the downstream reaches to enable fish and other aquatic life to survive in the river. A 2021 study of 50 hydropower plants however found that none of the plants surveyed release environmental-flows. All hydropower plants, as per their power purchasing agreements, are required to produce maximum power during the dry season. We should start by accepting the fact that rivers need clean flowing water and respecting the policies we have made. Then we must systematically introduce changes and avoid the oversights embedded in the present approach. The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems. In the present approach, nobody seems to want sediment which is a natural consequence of flow within the water cycle.To meet such an objective, we need to begin with a system of integrated knowledge that synthesises natural science, social science, and indigenous practices. By incorporating fields such as hydrology, ecology, social science-supported context-specific engineering, and indigenous knowledge and practices, we can take a comprehensive approach to water management challenges and solutions. Interdisciplinary approaches can build collaboration, innovation, and systemic decision-making and promote innovative water management for the benefit of both ecosystems and human societies.Do you think initiatives such as river clean up campaigns run by various groups help protect these waterways?I see such initiatives as manifestation of dissatisfaction of concerned citizens with the degradation of rivers and to bring about changes. In 1990, I was part of the Save Bagmati Campaign, which aimed to highlight the degrading state of the river. This campaign has taken many new forms, and citizen groups have begun campaigns in other rivers of Nepal. They however remain fragmented and ad-hoc. Similar campaigns in some countries have led to granting rights to rivers. In 2017, New Zealand recognised the Whanganui River and its tributaries as legal entities, acknowledging their physical and spiritual significance as âliving and indivisibleâ and ensuring their survival, health, and integrity to balance the needs of humans and nature. Promulgations like Living Indus (Pakistan), Namami Gange river-improvement programme (India) can offer lessons for a holistic water journey. The collective voice of concerned citizens for the integrity of rivers can be a powerful medium for policy and pathway changes. Nepal must also begin country-wide river restoration initiatives. We need more dialogue and conservation around water challenges and solutions.As cities turn into concrete jungles, their water tables are said to be receding alarmingly. You often propose redesigning our settlements and development infrastructure in a way that wouldnât disturb riversâ natural courses and catchment areas. Could you elaborate?South Asia is a region of waterscapes containing streams, ponds, wetlands, open spaces, floodplains, springs, and underground aquifers. Yet, our towns, cities, and infrastructure are planned, designed, and built to disregard water rather than live with it. As land-centric urban growth dominates, waterscapes temporarily seem to vanish but later water comes back. In Nepali we have a saying âIn twelve years a stream returnsâ. The present practice of urban development is obsessed with concretisation, making these areas impermeable. Rainwater, part of which would naturally infiltrate the ground, now immediately reaches the rivers already constrained by walls. The river at a downstream section immediately peaks and when the rainfall stops the river has very low discharge. Basic parameters, like the intensity of rainfall (mm per hour), are poorly recognised and used in design guidelines. The interaction of current urbanisation practices and increasing extreme rainfall, temperature and humidity rise spawned by climate change and urban heat island effects will make our urban areas as crucible of hazards, and unhealthy. A new urban future must harmoniously integrate nature, including water bodies and wetlands, and preserve natural land cover, including traditional ponds to promote groundwater recharge. It can be further achieved by preserving green open spaces, forests, gardens, permeable âspongeâ pavements, and natural waterfronts for healthier communities in sustainable cities. The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving riversâ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey. ","summary":"Ajaya Dixitâs current work focuses on studying challenges of building resilience across boundaries and at sub-national scales. He has studied and written extensively on water resources, trans-boundary water cooperation, flood management, wash services and climate change adaptation, clean energy transition and related policy studies. In this interview with the Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal, Dixit discusses river management in Nepalâs urban areas: Where have we gone wrong in this endeavour and what can we do? You have extensively studied river systems and have been following changes seen in river basins. How do you see recent problems caused by encroachment and rampant development activities?We humans have lived and have to continue to live within water cycles: water evaporates from the ocean to the sky and then precipitates to the land and flows via rivers back to the ocean. Rivers that function as arteries of the land surface, sustaining humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems face widespread abuses: pollution, rampant extraction of their bed and banks, fragmentation and degradation. Without rivers, we would not be who we are. Unfortunately, we have forgotten this essence. We neglect and abuse rivers. In 1981, just after the monsoon ended, I, along with my students, walked from Sundarijal to Teku studying Bagmati riversâ sediment. At many places, we walked on the riverbed. The river then was clean. Gradually, the river systems began to face all-round decay. I have read painful accounts of my contemporaries who remember swimming in the clean Bagmati and its tributaries. In less than 50 years, our rivers in Kathmandu Valley and other basins no longer look like rivers. I feel helpless and ache with pain at this collective failure! What state of rivers are we passing on to our next generation?River encroachment is common across Nepal but more serious in urban areas, including in Kathmandu. How can this be stopped?Our approach to rivers is an imitation of the trend common across South Asia, or the subcontinent, which is again largely based on the knowledge system developed in the industrialised Global North without contextualising locally. The region features waterscapes of high and punctuated rainfall during the monsoon months, rivers, wetlands, ponds, and springs, all connected with groundwater aquifers in one of the most complex landscapes of the world: the Himalaya-Ganga region. Yet, current development endeavours subjugate water rather than respect and live with it. In 2022, the Indus River in Pakistan faced major floods with devastating consequences. Referring to these floods, a group of global scientists stated that âthe impacts [of the floods] were the outcome of an outdated river management system.â This approach is primarily based on building of physical structures such as buildings, bridges and roads close to rivers interfering with their natural flows. The approach that began in the early twentieth century keeps marching on even while we are facing twenty first century water challenges.There is an increasing trend of building corridor roads along the rivers in Kathmandu as well as other places. Is this a good or bad practice? In Nepal, road building in the hills has earned the sobriquet of âdozer roads,â meaning politically designed roads excavated by heavy machine operators without adhering to basic engineering, social, environmental, or hydrological safeguards. Even highways built with âengineering,â such as the Mugling-Narayanghat section, face regular accidents. The sliding of the two buses in the Trishuli is the recent example. Building roads along the banks of rivers, defined as âriver corridors,â is the preferred approach for improving connectivity. In the Kathmandu Valley, this is also associated with rivers shackled within concrete walls in the name of river beautification. In the monsoon, however, they all overflow as we have been seeing in the last few years and this year as well.What will happen to these rivers 10-15 years down the line? Is there any chance of some of our rivers dying? Or, will the measures taken in recent times protect them?All rivers must flow clean and free in selected stretches. But today, rivers are disconnected with their floodplains. Within walls and embankments, they have become conduits of filth. Many rivers are already seriously degraded. If the current trend continues, many rivers may die. I remember Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, filmmaker, and author, who wrote: âWater and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.â Our current efforts at conserving, developing and managing rivers are grossly inadequate. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw some rivers heal as human actions across the board ceased due to the lockdown. But this healing came at huge human and economic costs. The lessons, however, are clear. We must stop turning rivers into garbage cans for them to begin to heal. The onus lies on us, our activities, our governance, and the policies we make and put into practice effectively. We need new ways of imagining rivers in harmony with human needs. Otherwise, the rivers will die. If rivers die, what will become of us?What problems may city dwellers face as a result of this continued destruction of rivers?A 2020 analysis of rivers in Nepal found that the quality of rivers in the mid-hills and the Tarai are already deteriorating. Industries, cities, towns, and agriculture produce waste that, when disposed of in rivers untreated, cause pollution. Solid and liquid wastes produced by expanding cities and towns pollute nearby rivers, streams, and water bodies. Pollution kills aquatic life such as fish, which are sources of livelihood for many communities. Polluted rivers and water bodies degrade human and environmental health, leading to negative impacts on human livelihoods. The impacts of pollution on rivers are considerable during non-monsoon months when river discharge, and consequently the capacity of rivers to dilute waste, are low.What should be done to conserve the rivers, at least in the present form, and stop further damages?All rivers are a combination of water (W), energy (E), biodiversity aquatic (B), and sediment (S), represented by the acronym WEBS. In the current scheme of things, the focus is on water and energy. Aquatic ecosystems are the concern of only those working on freshwater ecosystems. They are neglected in the larger context though the state has made some provisions for conserving ecosystems. In Nepalâs Hydropower Development Policy of 2001 all hydropower plants must release 10 percent minimum flow to the downstream reaches to enable fish and other aquatic life to survive in the river. A 2021 study of 50 hydropower plants however found that none of the plants surveyed release environmental-flows. All hydropower plants, as per their power purchasing agreements, are required to produce maximum power during the dry season. We should start by accepting the fact that rivers need clean flowing water and respecting the policies we have made. Then we must systematically introduce changes and avoid the oversights embedded in the present approach. The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems.

Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people donât have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandoraâs Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the societyâs mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress donât seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UMLâs style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the partyâs structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the partyâs top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oliâs Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oliâs working style.Why didnât the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime ministerâs office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oliâs leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end âunnecessary bargainingâ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I donât know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?Itâs true that all three party chiefsâDeuba, Oli and Dahalâare very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. Itâs like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didnât involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The partyâs central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didnât they oppose it at the meeting? I donât see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We canât backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we donât need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the partyâs image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders donât like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal arenât given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leadersâwhether the seniors or young onesâare becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders havenât spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Havenât the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they donât get an acceptable power sharing deal, they donât cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they arenât loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them.

But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?Itâs true that all three party chiefsâDeuba, Oli and Dahalâare very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. Itâs like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didnât involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The partyâs central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didnât they oppose it at the meeting? I donât see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We canât backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we donât need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the partyâs image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders donât like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal arenât given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leadersâwhether the seniors or young onesâare becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders havenât spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Havenât the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they donât get an acceptable power sharing deal, they donât cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they arenât loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them.

The Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we havenât been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to peopleâs expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenonâranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan rangeâmakes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaskiâs Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japanâs Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures werenât as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesnât have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companiesâNTC and NCellâto transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department havenât changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we havenât been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we donât have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we donât even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Donât you think itâs already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we donât have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didnât have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecomsâNTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we canât focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why donât people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesnât match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isnât as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to peopleâs livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the âEarly Warning For Allâ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldnât limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this departmentâs organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource. ","summary":"In Nepal, monsoon-related disasters have killed numerous people despite technological and expertise advancements in weather forecasting, with the need for more stations and upgraded methods to cope with climate change, which is causing more extreme weather events."},{"hash":"1792de717ab67d9f07a44fb8a222b8bbb48b968008bc1ce4341594e687627403","title":"oppressed-classes-felt-betrayed-other-sections-didn-t-accept-maoists","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/07/15/oppressed-classes-felt-betrayed-other-sections-didn-t-accept-maoists","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/interviews/in0-1721017994.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1721001600000,"source":"kp","category":"interviews","content":"**July 1 Midnight Deal and Its Impact**\n\nThe July 1st alliance between the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML has sparked controversy.
