With power dynamics shaping law enforcement at every level—local, national, and even regional—the fragile boundary between governance and lawlessness continues to blur.\nSeveral people’s representatives, including federal parliament members, provincial ministers, and local government officials, are currently in police custody for their alleged involvement in criminal activities, including serious offenses.The Nepal Police is investigating numerous cases, raising significant concerns about the integrity and accountability of lawmakers entrusted with the responsibilities of legislation and governance.\nAccording to the Nepal Police database, 37 people’s representatives are in custody for further investigation into their alleged involvement in various crimes. \nThese individuals include two federal parliament members, one provincial minister, one mayor, one rural municipality chairperson, one vice-chairperson, and several ward chairpersons. \nMany are allegedly involved in cooperative scams. Additionally, three face charges of attempted murder, one for abduction, two for acts of discrimination, and one for child sexual abuse.\nMPs Under Police Investigation and in Custody\nSeveral Members of Parliament (MPs), responsible for making laws, are currently in police custody for violating the law, while some are still under investigation. \nFor example, Deepak Manange, an MP from the Gandaki Provincial Assembly, is in jail following a Supreme Court verdict that found him guilty of attempting to murder Milan Gurung. \nInvestigations into cooperative scams are ongoing against Rabi Lamichhane, President of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, following a recommendation by the Parliamentary Committee. \nAdditionally, an investigation into money laundering is underway. Meanwhile, Congress MP Dhanraj Gurung was interrogated by a team from the Central Bureau of Investigation regarding the Miteri Cooperative scam for five hours on November 13. \nAn investigation into Rastriya Prajatantra Party MP Geeta Basnet regarding the cooperative scam is also ongoing, with a case registered against her in Nawalparasi. \nMP Top Bahadur Rayamajhi has been remanded to custody for trial in connection with the fake Bhutanese refugee case and was suspended from his position as an MP after being remanded. \nRecently, following the recommendation for an investigation into money laundering against Rabi Lamichhane, discussions have arisen regarding whether he will be suspended from his position as an MP. \nParliamentarians from the Rastriya Swatantra Party have urged Speaker Devraj Ghimire not to suspend him. \nOn Monday, Rastriya Swatantra Party MPs Santosh Pariyar, Sobita Gautam, and Ganesh Parajuli met Speaker Ghimire at Singha Durbar and requested him not to suspend Lamichhane, citing the precedent of MP Tek Bahadur Gurung. \n\"We have requested the Speaker not to suspend him, providing the precedent of MP Tek Bahadur Gurung,\" said Ganesh Parajuli. The Speaker informed them that he is seeking legal consultation on the matter.\nWhat Was the Case of MP Tek Bahadur Gurung?\nGurung was elected as a Member of Parliament from Manang in the general election held on December 4 last year. \nAt the time of his candidacy, a corruption case was already under consideration against him. \nDuring his tenure as the State Minister for Labour and Employment, Gurung faced allegations of corruption related to renting land at Kathmandu Funpark, which led to a case being filed against him at the Special Court. \nFollowing a letter from the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), Gurung was suspended by the Parliament Secretariat on December 12, 2022. \nIn the case, the Special Court found him guilty and imposed a fine of NPR 1,21,84,000. \nAfter the verdict, Gurung filed a petition with the Supreme Court seeking the revocation of his suspension. \nThe Supreme Court, while hearing his case, determined that the letter from the CIAA and the subsequent suspension notice issued by the Parliament Secretariat were flawed. Consequently, the Supreme Court overturned the suspension through an order of remand.\nWhat Are the Provisions of the Money Laundering Act and Parliamentary Regulation?\nSection 27 of the Money Laundering (Prevention) Act states: “A person holding any position in an organized institution established under prevailing law, or a government employee, or any public servant, shall be considered suspended during the period of detention under this Act, and until the completion of the case filed under Section 22, such person will remain suspended.” \nThis section mentions automatic suspension, which applies to MPs as well, meaning it does not require a letter from the police or notice from the Speaker. \nHowever, parliamentary regulations provide a slightly different arrangement.

The India-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1950 formalized the special relationship between the two countries, ensuring reciprocal rights for Indian and Nepali citizens in areas such as residence, property ownership, business, and free movement across borders.\nBoth neighbors have a strategically important for each others and both countries prioritize fostering strong bilateral ties in their foreign policies. Their cooperation spans critical areas such as trade, energy, security, and cultural, underscoring their deep and mutually beneficial relationship.\nNepal shares its border with five Indian states—Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Sikkim, and Bihar—making it a vital hub for cultural and economic exchange between the two nations. Nepal is a priority partner of India under its ‘Neighborhood First’ Policy. \nDespite the interconnectedness of the modern world through migration, globalization, and digitalization, one constant remains: neighbors cannot be changed. Their relationship must be valued as essential for national stability, progress, and enduring friendship.  \nNepal-India relations are mutually beneficial, encompassing national security, regional stability, and economic progress. Beyond their geographical and cultural proximities, the multifaceted and multidimensional ties between the two countries have significantly influenced their relationship in a positive and constructive manner.\nNepal- India Political Relations\nNepal and India share a political relationship that is informal, unique, deep, and multifaceted. India’s support has been pivotal in shaping Nepal’s democratic movements over the years.India remains Nepal’s largest defense exporter and a reliable security partner, contributing significantly to Nepal’s military capabilities. Defense cooperation is pivotal in bolster military-to-military cooperation, emphasizing mutual trust, maintaining peace, addressing disputes, and strengthening mutual understanding.\n\n\nIndia played a key role in supporting Nepal’s democratic forces against the Rana regime in 1950, backed the pro-democracy movements against the monarchy in 1989-90 and 2006, and facilitated the peace process that ended Nepal’s decade-long armed insurgency.India served as a safe haven for underground and exiled Nepali political leaders who faced repression during the Rana regime, the Panchayat era, and after the royal coup. Several Nepali leaders, inspired by their participation in the Indian independence movement and their experiences in exile, were deeply committed to liberating Nepal from the Rana regime’s autocratic rule.\nNepal-India relations go beyond just treaties and agreements, marked by frequent high-level visits and interactions between the leaders of the two countries. These visits have fostered goodwill, trust, understanding, and cooperation, strengthening the bilateral relationship on a more mature and pragmatic footing.\nSince May 2014, Nepal and India have been 17 exchanges at the Head of State or Head of Government level. During this period, the Prime Ministers of Nepal have visited India 10 times, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has 5 visits to Nepal. \nThe last visit by Prime Minister Modi to Nepal was to Lumbini on 16 May 2022. The recent visit by a Nepali prime minister was by former PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ from 31 May to 3 June 2023. Both nations continue to explore new avenues of cooperation to revive and further enhance their relationship. In November 2016, the President of India paid a State Visit to Nepal, marking the first visit by an Indian President in 18 years. Similarly, in April 2017, the then-President of Nepal, Bidya Devi Bhandari, reciprocated with a State Visit to India.\nNepal and India both committed to strengthening bilateral relations and expanding the scope of collaboration. The most recent high-level visit was by Dr. Arzu Rana Deuba, Nepal’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, who visited India from 18th to 22nd August 2024. During her visit, she held discussions with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, and other senior Indian officials. India’s Foreign Secretary, Vikram Misri, paid an official visit to Nepal from 11th to 12th August 2024. This marked his first visit to Nepal after assuming office.  \nGeneral Upendra Dwivedi, the Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army, visited Kathmandu from 20th to 24th November 2024 for a five-day official visit. During his visit, he was conferred with the honorary rank of General of the Nepali Army. Similarly, General Ashok Raj Sigdel, Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) of the Nepali Army, embarked on a four-day official visit to India from 11th to 14th December 2024 to receive the honorary rank of General of the Indian Army.  \nThese high-level political and military visits reflect an earnest effort to revitalise and strengthen India-Nepal relations.  \nNepal-India Defense Ties\nNepal and India share a long-standing, vast, deep and unique defense relationship rooted in history and mutual cooperation. The Indian Army has been recruiting Nepali citizens as soldiers since the signing of the Tripartite Agreement on November 9, 1947, between the governments of the United Kingdom, India, and Nepal. Today, approximately 32,000 Gorkha soldiers from Nepal serve in the Indian Army, while around 1.25 lakh Indian Army pensioners reside in Nepal.\nNepal plays a critical strategic role in India’s “Himalayan frontiers” policy. Alongside Bhutan, it serves as a northern buffer state, offering protection against potential aggression from China. This underscores the importance of their military cooperation, which extends beyond traditional ties.\nDuring his addressing Nepal Constituent Assembly on August 3, 2014, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi  Praising the contribution of Gurkha soldiers in India's defence. Modi said India has won no war without the sacrifices by Nepali soldiers.\nModi, stating, “There is no war India has won without the blood of Gurkhas. I respect their contribution.” He also quoted former Indian Army chief Sam Manekshaw, saying, “If a man says he is not afraid of dying, he is either lying or is a Gurkha”.\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, six of the original ten Gurkha regiments from the British Indian Army were retained by the Indian Army. Additionally, a new regiment, the 11th Gurkha Rifles, was raised. These Gurkha regiments quickly established themselves as a permanent and vital part of the newly independent Indian Army.\nThe Gurkha regiments of the British Indian Army had earned unparalleled recognition, winning a dozen Victoria Crosses and numerous other top honors during World War I and II. In 1947, following India’s independence, the Gurkha regiments were divided between the British and Indian armies under the terms of the Tripartite Agreement.\nGurkhas from Nepal and India are not only recruited into the dedicated Gurkha battalions but also serve in other elite units, including the Indian Army’s special forces, such as parachute battalions. The Indian Army currently has seven Gurkha regiments—the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th, and 11th Gurkha Rifles—comprising around 32,000 Nepali soldiers. Each regiment consists of five to six battalions, with 800 to 1,000 soldiers per battalion, showcasing the indispensable role Gurkhas continue to play in India’s defense forces.\nOne of the unique aspects of Nepal-India defense ties is the long-standing tradition of conferring honorary general titles upon each other’s army chiefs, a practice that began in 1950 when then-Indian Army Chief General Kodandera Madappa Cariappa visited Nepal. Nepal’s Surendra Bahadur Shah was the first to be honored with the title in India. This exchange of honorary general titles reflects the close defense relations between the two nations. To date, 16 Nepal Army Chiefs and 20 Indian Army Chiefs have been bestowed this honor, marking a significant milestone in strengthening bilateral defense ties.\nDefense collaboration between India and Nepal continues to evolve, despite differences over India’s implementation of the Agnipath scheme (path of fire) which recruits young soldiers to serve for four years, with only the top-performing quarter continuing in a longer military career. Nepal has disagreed with this approach and continues to uphold the recruitment of Nepali Gurkha soldiers into the Indian Army.\nJoint military exercises between Nepal and India held annually, alternating between the two countries.The Indian Army has consistently provided support during crises in Nepal, including being the first to respond after the 2015 earthquake with search, rescue, and relief operations. \nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indian Army extended various assistance including vaccines to supporting the Nepali Army and aiding citizens through relief materials and medical supplies.Nepal-India-Bangladesh energy agreement highlighting the increasing regional collaboration in energy trade and connectivity. India is involved in hydropower projects across Nepal’s rivers that will collectively generate 8,000 MW upon completion.\n\n\nIndia remains Nepal’s largest defense exporter and a reliable security partner, contributing significantly to Nepal’s military capabilities. Defense cooperation is pivotal in bolster military-to-military cooperation, emphasizing mutual trust, maintaining peace, addressing disputes, and strengthening mutual understanding.Nepal-India Energy Cooperation:\nNepal and India have been deepening energy cooperation in recent years, focusing on Nepal’s abundant clean energy resources, namely hydropower. On January 4, 2024, the two governments signed a landmark 25-year power trade agreement during Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar’s visit to Nepal. Under this agreement, Nepal will export 10,000 MW of electricity to India within the next decade. Notably, India’s Cabinet had already approved the purchase of this power on September 5, 2023. The agreement is set to auto-renew every 10 years after the initial 25-year term, enabling medium- and long-term power purchase agreements spanning 5-10 years.\nDespite legal challenges, the Supreme Court of Nepal upheld the validity of the deal. This agreement highlights the growing synergy between the two nations in the energy sector. Nepal aims to generate 13,000 MW of electricity by 2030 and 28,500 MW by 2035 to meet both domestic and foreign export demands. With its domestic electricity needs projected to reach 13,000 MW by 2035, Nepal has targeted exporting 10,000 MW to India over the next decade and 5,000 MW to Bangladesh by 2035. Achieving these ambitious goals requires significant hydropower development to produce around 28,000 MW within the next 10 years, emphasizing Nepal’s growing role as a regional clean energy hub.\nOne of the most successful areas of the India-Nepal bilateral cooperation is the power sector. The Joint Vision Statement on Power Sector Cooperation on April 2, 2022, during the visit of Nepal’s Prime Minister to India, outlined a comprehensive roadmap for collaboration. Key pillars of this cooperation include the joint development of power generation projects in Nepal, the development of cross-border transmission infrastructure, bi-directional power trade, coordinated operation of national grids, and institutional collaboration in sharing the latest operational information, technology, and expertise. Significant progress is already visible, with Nepal estimated to earn approximately NPR 10-15 crores per day through power exports to India.\nIndian investments in Nepal’s hydropower sector have created a significant market and investment opportunities, making Indian involvement pivotal. As a result, Nepal has not actively sought alternatives or third-country participation in its hydropower sector.\nIn October, 2024, Nepal, India, and Bangladesh signed a historic trilateral agreement to trade 40 MW of electricity from Nepal, marking the first time Nepal was able to export power to a third country. This milestone underscores the evolving regional energy cooperation facilitated through Indian infrastructure.\nNepal and India aim to establish infrastructure capable of supporting the transmission of 12,700 MW of electricity by 2030, with several key projects underway. Among these is the 400 kV Dhalkebar-Sitamarhi transmission line, which will have a capacity of 2,500 MW and is dedicated to exporting power from the Arun III hydropower project. This line is expected to become operational by 2025/26. Additionally, the 132 kV Nepalgunj-Nanpara line with a 200 MW capacity is slated for completion by the same year.\nOther major 400 kV cross-border transmission projects include New Butwal-Gorakhpur, Inaruwa-Purnea, and Kohalpur-Lucknow, collectively capable of transmitting up to 2,500 MW.\nIn a significant development for regional energy trade, Nepal, India, and Bangladesh have signed a trilateral agreement to export 40 MW of electricity to Bangladesh. This trade marks the first instance of Nepal being allowed to sell electricity to a third country through Indian transmission infrastructure.NEA exported approximately 1.76 billion units of electricity worth Rs. 13.04 billion to India from July 16 to December 15, 2024, in the current fiscal year 2024/25.\n\nNepal-India-Bangladesh energy agreement highlighting the increasing regional collaboration in energy trade and connectivity. India is involved in hydropower projects across Nepal’s rivers that will collectively generate 8,000 MW upon completion.Several Indian companies are actively participating in Nepal’s hydropower development, underscoring the deepening energy ties between the two nations.\nIndian State-owned SJVN Limited is developing the 769 MW Tamor Hydropower Project in the Arun Basin and has also acquired the 679 MW Lower Arun project. The Arun-4 hydropower project, with a capacity of 490 MW, has been awarded to Sutlej Jal Vidyut Nigam (SJVN), a joint venture with India’s state-owned Sutlej Hydropower Corporation, which is already working on the upstream 900 MW Arun-3 project.\nIndia’s NHPC Limited (National Hydroelectric Power Corporation) has taken on the ambitious 750 MW West Seti hydropower project, further cementing its presence in Nepal’s energy sector.\nThe 900 MW Upper Karnali Hydroelectric Project, awarded in 2014, and other projects like West Seti and Upper Karnali will contribute an additional 2,000 MW of electricity from western Nepal for export to India. Together, these investments highlight India’s significant role in harnessing Nepal’s hydropower potential.\nEnergy remains a cornerstone of India-Nepal relations, with cross-border electricity trade gaining significant momentum in recent years through numerous agreements and infrastructure developments. Emerging shifts in \nCooperation in electricity generation focused in mutual benefit for both nations. The signing of the Agreement on Electric Power Trade, Cross-Border Transmission Interconnections, and Grid Connectivity in October 2014 marked a milestone in Nepal-India energy relations. This agreement, initiated under Prime Minister Modi’s HIT (Highways, I-ways, and Transways) initiative, was a key outcome of his first foreign visit to Nepal. At the time, Nepal was grappling with over 18 hours of daily load shedding.\nIndia’s Conduct of Business Rule (CBR) of February 2021 stipulated that it would only import electricity from neighboring countries with formal energy trade agreements. In November 2021, India granted Nepal permission to sell surplus electricity in line with the Cross Border Trade of Electricity (CBTE) guidelines. Nepal began exporting 39 MW of electricity to India via the 400 kV Muzaffarpur-Dhalkebar transmission line, a significant step in regional energy integration.\nThe Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) has received approval from India to sell 941 MW of electricity generated from 28 projects in the Indian market under competitive market and medium-term power sales agreements. Nepal initially secured approval in November 2021 to sell 39 MW in India’s Energy Exchange Market through the day-ahead market.Hinduism and Buddhism have been pivotal in enhancing cultural connectivity, with both countries sharing significant religious sites that form an integral part of their spiritual heritage. Completing a pilgrimage often requires visiting sites in both nations, symbolizing their intertwined cultural and religious history.\n\n This capacity was subsequently expanded to 346 MW in April 2022, further growing to 472 MW, and eventually reaching 941 MW. This progression highlights the increasing trade potential and growing energy cooperation between Nepal and India.NEA exported approximately 1.76 billion units of electricity worth Rs. 13.04 billion to India from July 16 to December 15, 2024, in the current fiscal year 2024/25. Export volumes could have been higher if not for disruptions caused by floods and landslides in late September, which damaged the 456 MW Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Project. NEA had set a target to export electricity worth Rs. 30 billion for the current fiscal year. However, this goal is impacted due to the damage sustained by hydropower projects and transmission lines from the natural disasters.\nIndia has also committed to developing key hydropower projects in Nepal, including Arun-III, Lower Arun, Upper Karnali, and Pancheshwar. These storage-based projects aim to generate electricity during non-peak periods and export surplus energy to India and other nations, ensuring mutual energy security and advancing bilateral cooperation. However, Nepal still needs to significantly enhance its transmission capacity to maximize these opportunities and facilitate robust energy trade.\nNepal has immense potential for renewable energy, particularly in hydropower and solar. Hydropower remains dominant in Nepal’s energy mix, contributing 95% of the total installed capacity. Studies estimate Nepal’s hydropower potential between 42,000 MW (economic and technical) and 130,000 MW (practical). Current projects under various stages of development include over 107 MW of solar energy, with 82 MW from private developers and 25 MW installed by the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA).\nTo achieve Nepal’s Paris Agreement goals of net-zero emissions by 2045 and the 15th periodic plan’s target of 20% renewable energy by 2030, Nepal aims to generate 5,000 MW of renewable energy by 2030. Indian investments will be vital in accelerating these efforts to strengthen Nepal’s renewable energy sector, ensuring regional energy security and economic growth.\nAccording to the Investment Board Nepal (IBN) report from April 2024, Nepal receives solar radiation capable of producing 3.6 to 6.2 kWh of electricity per square meter, with an average insolation intensity of 4.7 kWh per square meter per day and 300 sunny days annually. These conditions make solar energy a promising alternative, especially as installation costs continue to decline. However, substantial investments, particularly from Indian companies, are essential to unlock this potential.\nNepal-India Cultural Relations\nCultural relations form one of the key foundations of India-Nepal ties. India and Nepal share a deep-rooted cultural bond that is organic and historically significant. The people of Nepal and India share deep interdependence due to linguistic, ritualistic, cultural, marital, and other similarities. This connection is further strengthened by the open and harmonious border between the two countries, as well as economic interactions.  \nProminent pilgrimage sites such as Pashupatinath, Muktinath, Janakpurdham, and Lumbini in Nepal, alongside Char Dham, Varanasi, Ayodhya, and Bodhgaya in India, play an instrumental role in fostering unity between the two nations.India’s history of development cooperation with Nepal dates back to the 1950s, with major projects undertaken over the years, including the East-West Highway, the Nepal-Bharat Maitri Emergency and Trauma Centre (₹100 crore), BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences in Dharan, and the five-story OPD complex at Bir Hospital.\n\n Hinduism and Buddhism have been pivotal in enhancing cultural connectivity, with both countries sharing significant religious sites that form an integral part of their spiritual heritage. Completing a pilgrimage often requires visiting sites in both nations, symbolizing their intertwined cultural and religious history.The Indian government has invested considerable resources and effort in promoting people-to-people connections in art, culture, academics, and media. This includes organizing cultural programs, symposia, events, conferences, and seminars in collaboration with various institutions, further solidifying the cultural bond between the two nations. \nBollywood films and Indian TV shows enjoy immense popularity in Nepal. Hindi is widely understood by most Nepali speakers, while many regions in India have Nepali-speaking communities. The Government of India actively promotes people-to-people connections in various fields, including art, culture, academics, and media. This is achieved through cultural programs, symposia, and events organized in collaboration with local bodies in Nepal, as well as conferences and seminars in languages such as Hindi and Sanskrit.\nIn 2023, Nepal joined India in celebrating 75 years of “Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav” with a series of events showcasing music, dance, development partnerships, and startup collaborations. Established in August 2007, the Swami Vivekananda Centre for Indian Culture in Kathmandu continues to exhibit the best of Indian cultural heritage. Similarly, the Nepal-Bharat Library, founded in 1951 as the first foreign library in Nepal, plays a pivotal role in enhancing cultural ties and facilitating information exchange between the two countries.\nTo deepen educational and cultural cooperation, the B.P. Koirala India-Nepal Foundation was established in 1991. Its objective is to foster collaboration in education, culture, science, and technical fields, promoting mutual understanding and the sharing of professional expertise.\nAdditionally, efforts to strengthen media and academic partnerships include familiarization visits to India for Nepali journalists and editors, along with short-term training programs in print and electronic media, archaeology, and other areas of professional development. These initiatives continue to reinforce the unique cultural relationship between India and Nepal.\nNepal-India Development Partnership \nThe India-Nepal Development Partnership has been steadily expanding for over seven decades. Nepal is one of India’s largest and most prominent development partners. \nThis long-standing cooperation began in 1951 with the construction of the Gauchar Airport in Kathmandu, now known as Tribhuvan International Airport. The India-Nepal Development Partnership stands as a testament to the enduring bond between the two nations.\nIndia’s development assistance to Nepal spans a wide range of sectors, including infrastructure, education, health, agriculture, and capacity building. This partnership reflects the deep-rooted cultural heritage and people-to-people ties shared by the two nations.\nIndia is Nepal’s largest development donor, focusing primarily on large-scale infrastructure projects through grants that address priority sectors such as health, education, and connectivity.This global initiative has trained over 200,000 professionals—spanning both civilian and defense sectors—from more than 160 countries. For Nepal alone, over 2,000 professionals, bureaucrats, and defense personnel have participated in this capacity-building program since 2007.\n\n India’s history of development cooperation with Nepal dates back to the 1950s, with major projects undertaken over the years, including the East-West Highway, the Nepal-Bharat Maitri Emergency and Trauma Centre (₹100 crore), BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences in Dharan, and the five-story OPD complex at Bir Hospital.In recent years, the partnership has significantly advanced Nepal’s connectivity and access to international markets. Key projects include:\nRail Links: Development of Nepal’s first broad-gauge railway line between Jayanagar and Bijalpura-Bardibas, the Jogbani-Biratnagar rail link, and the ongoing Raxaul-Kathmandu rail line.\nIntegrated Check Posts (ICPs): Establishment of ICPs in Birgunj (Nepal’s first ICP), Biratnagar, Nepalgunj, and Bhairahawa.\nCross-Border Train Services: Launch of Nepal’s first cross-border passenger train service between Jayanagar and Kurtha during former PM Sher Bahadur Deuba’s visit to India in April 2022, and the first freight train service during Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit in June 2023.\nTo boost infrastructure in western Nepal, construction of a motorable bridge in Dharchula commenced in October 2022. Additionally, the National Police Academy in Nepal is being built with Indian grant assistance.\nPetroleum Pipeline: In 2019, India completed South Asia’s first cross-border petroleum pipeline connecting Motihari (India) to Amlekhgunj (Nepal). This project has brought immense benefits, saving Nepal approximately ₹9 crore monthly and achieving a record supply of 100 million liters of diesel in December 2020 alone.\nHigh-Impact Community Development Projects: Through the High-Impact Community Development Projects (HICDP) program, India works at the grassroots level to improve the quality of life in Nepal. This includes constructing hospitals, schools, drinking water facilities, and sanitation infrastructure. Since 2003, India has undertaken over 551 projects across Nepal at a total cost of ₹1,249 crores, with a recently increased project cap of ₹20 crores (January 2024).\nIndia has also distributed 1,009 ambulances and 300 school buses to Nepal since 1994, significantly contributing to Nepal’s healthcare and education sectors.\nLines of Credit and Post-Earthquake Reconstruction: Beyond grant assistance, India has extended Lines of Credit (LOCs) worth $1.65 billion for infrastructure development, including roads, transmission lines, and post-earthquake reconstruction. LOCs have been instrumental in financing vital projects to rebuild and modernize Nepal’s infrastructure.\nNepal-India Education Partnership\nIndia’s development partnership with Nepal significantly emphasizes human resource development and education. Each year, the Government of India provides over 1,500 scholarships for Nepali students, supporting studies both in India and Nepal. These scholarships cover a wide range of disciplines, including medicine, engineering, agriculture, business, nursing, Ayurveda and traditional medicine, music, and dance. Since 2001, more than 38,000 Nepali nationals have directly benefitted from these programs.Bilateral trade typically takes place in Indian rupees, and Nepal’s central bank maintains a list of 163 items that can be imported from India in dollars using a Letter of Credit. The Indian rupee is fully convertible in Nepal, and the exchange rate is set at NRs. 1.6 per Indian rupee.\n\n\nFor government officials and professionals, Nepal remains a key partner under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) program, initiated in 1964.This global initiative has trained over 200,000 professionals—spanning both civilian and defense sectors—from more than 160 countries. For Nepal alone, over 2,000 professionals, bureaucrats, and defense personnel have participated in this capacity-building program since 2007. In recent years, the program has supported doctors, judicial professionals, officials from the Office of the Attorney General, and members of the Nepali Police, further solidifying the strong educational collaboration between the two nations.\nNepal-India Economic and commercial Relations\nNepal and India share strong trade and commercial ties, with India being Nepal’s largest trading partner and Indian firms among the top investors. In 2023, Nepal became India’s 18th largest export destination, up from 28th in 2014.\nIndia plays a vital role in Nepal’s third-country trade by providing essential transit facilities. Both public and private sector investments from India have significantly boosted bilateral trade. However, Nepal faces an increasing trade deficit with India. To regulate trade and transit, Nepal and India have signed key agreements, including the Treaty of Transit, Treaty of Trade, and the Agreement to Control Unauthorized Trade.\nNepal and India have maintained the currency pegged system to make trade easier, smooth cross transaction& stabilize the Nepali Currency.  The Nepal Currency and Expansion Act of 1957 eliminated the use of Indian currency in Nepal. Nepali currency was pegged at INR 100 for NPR 160, a system still in place today.\nIndia accounts for nearly two-thirds of Nepal’s merchandise trade, about one-third of trade in services, and almost 100% of petroleum supplies. Additionally, India contributes significantly to inward remittances, including those from pensioners, professionals, and workers employed in India.\nIndia is the largest source of foreign investment in Nepal, accounting for over 33.3% of the total FDI stock, valued at nearly USD 641 million. Around 150 Indian ventures operate across various sectors in Nepal, including manufacturing, banking, insurance, dry ports, education, telecom, power, and tourism.

The India-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1950 formalized the special relationship between the two countries, ensuring reciprocal rights for Indian and Nepali citizens in areas such as residence, property ownership, business, and free movement across borders.\nBoth neighbors have a strategically important for each others and both countries prioritize fostering strong bilateral ties in their foreign policies. Their cooperation spans critical areas such as trade, energy, security, and cultural, underscoring their deep and mutually beneficial relationship.\nNepal shares its border with five Indian states—Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Sikkim, and Bihar—making it a vital hub for cultural and economic exchange between the two nations. Nepal is a priority partner of India under its ‘Neighborhood First’ Policy. \nDespite the interconnectedness of the modern world through migration, globalization, and digitalization, one constant remains: neighbors cannot be changed. Their relationship must be valued as essential for national stability, progress, and enduring friendship.  \nNepal-India relations are mutually beneficial, encompassing national security, regional stability, and economic progress. Beyond their geographical and cultural proximities, the multifaceted and multidimensional ties between the two countries have significantly influenced their relationship in a positive and constructive manner.\nNepal- India Political Relations\nNepal and India share a political relationship that is informal, unique, deep, and multifaceted. India’s support has been pivotal in shaping Nepal’s democratic movements over the years.India remains Nepal’s largest defense exporter and a reliable security partner, contributing significantly to Nepal’s military capabilities. Defense cooperation is pivotal in bolster military-to-military cooperation, emphasizing mutual trust, maintaining peace, addressing disputes, and strengthening mutual understanding.\n\n\nIndia played a key role in supporting Nepal’s democratic forces against the Rana regime in 1950, backed the pro-democracy movements against the monarchy in 1989-90 and 2006, and facilitated the peace process that ended Nepal’s decade-long armed insurgency.India served as a safe haven for underground and exiled Nepali political leaders who faced repression during the Rana regime, the Panchayat era, and after the royal coup. Several Nepali leaders, inspired by their participation in the Indian independence movement and their experiences in exile, were deeply committed to liberating Nepal from the Rana regime’s autocratic rule.\nNepal-India relations go beyond just treaties and agreements, marked by frequent high-level visits and interactions between the leaders of the two countries. These visits have fostered goodwill, trust, understanding, and cooperation, strengthening the bilateral relationship on a more mature and pragmatic footing.\nSince May 2014, Nepal and India have been 17 exchanges at the Head of State or Head of Government level. During this period, the Prime Ministers of Nepal have visited India 10 times, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has 5 visits to Nepal. \nThe last visit by Prime Minister Modi to Nepal was to Lumbini on 16 May 2022. The recent visit by a Nepali prime minister was by former PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ from 31 May to 3 June 2023. Both nations continue to explore new avenues of cooperation to revive and further enhance their relationship. In November 2016, the President of India paid a State Visit to Nepal, marking the first visit by an Indian President in 18 years. Similarly, in April 2017, the then-President of Nepal, Bidya Devi Bhandari, reciprocated with a State Visit to India.\nNepal and India both committed to strengthening bilateral relations and expanding the scope of collaboration. The most recent high-level visit was by Dr. Arzu Rana Deuba, Nepal’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, who visited India from 18th to 22nd August 2024. During her visit, she held discussions with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, and other senior Indian officials. India’s Foreign Secretary, Vikram Misri, paid an official visit to Nepal from 11th to 12th August 2024. This marked his first visit to Nepal after assuming office.  \nGeneral Upendra Dwivedi, the Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army, visited Kathmandu from 20th to 24th November 2024 for a five-day official visit. During his visit, he was conferred with the honorary rank of General of the Nepali Army. Similarly, General Ashok Raj Sigdel, Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) of the Nepali Army, embarked on a four-day official visit to India from 11th to 14th December 2024 to receive the honorary rank of General of the Indian Army.  \nThese high-level political and military visits reflect an earnest effort to revitalise and strengthen India-Nepal relations.  \nNepal-India Defense Ties\nNepal and India share a long-standing, vast, deep and unique defense relationship rooted in history and mutual cooperation. The Indian Army has been recruiting Nepali citizens as soldiers since the signing of the Tripartite Agreement on November 9, 1947, between the governments of the United Kingdom, India, and Nepal. Today, approximately 32,000 Gorkha soldiers from Nepal serve in the Indian Army, while around 1.25 lakh Indian Army pensioners reside in Nepal.\nNepal plays a critical strategic role in India’s “Himalayan frontiers” policy. Alongside Bhutan, it serves as a northern buffer state, offering protection against potential aggression from China. This underscores the importance of their military cooperation, which extends beyond traditional ties.\nDuring his addressing Nepal Constituent Assembly on August 3, 2014, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi  Praising the contribution of Gurkha soldiers in India's defence. Modi said India has won no war without the sacrifices by Nepali soldiers.\nModi, stating, “There is no war India has won without the blood of Gurkhas. I respect their contribution.” He also quoted former Indian Army chief Sam Manekshaw, saying, “If a man says he is not afraid of dying, he is either lying or is a Gurkha”.\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, six of the original ten Gurkha regiments from the British Indian Army were retained by the Indian Army. Additionally, a new regiment, the 11th Gurkha Rifles, was raised. These Gurkha regiments quickly established themselves as a permanent and vital part of the newly independent Indian Army.\nThe Gurkha regiments of the British Indian Army had earned unparalleled recognition, winning a dozen Victoria Crosses and numerous other top honors during World War I and II. In 1947, following India’s independence, the Gurkha regiments were divided between the British and Indian armies under the terms of the Tripartite Agreement.\nGurkhas from Nepal and India are not only recruited into the dedicated Gurkha battalions but also serve in other elite units, including the Indian Army’s special forces, such as parachute battalions. The Indian Army currently has seven Gurkha regiments—the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th, and 11th Gurkha Rifles—comprising around 32,000 Nepali soldiers. Each regiment consists of five to six battalions, with 800 to 1,000 soldiers per battalion, showcasing the indispensable role Gurkhas continue to play in India’s defense forces.\nOne of the unique aspects of Nepal-India defense ties is the long-standing tradition of conferring honorary general titles upon each other’s army chiefs, a practice that began in 1950 when then-Indian Army Chief General Kodandera Madappa Cariappa visited Nepal. Nepal’s Surendra Bahadur Shah was the first to be honored with the title in India. This exchange of honorary general titles reflects the close defense relations between the two nations. To date, 16 Nepal Army Chiefs and 20 Indian Army Chiefs have been bestowed this honor, marking a significant milestone in strengthening bilateral defense ties.\nDefense collaboration between India and Nepal continues to evolve, despite differences over India’s implementation of the Agnipath scheme (path of fire) which recruits young soldiers to serve for four years, with only the top-performing quarter continuing in a longer military career. Nepal has disagreed with this approach and continues to uphold the recruitment of Nepali Gurkha soldiers into the Indian Army.\nJoint military exercises between Nepal and India held annually, alternating between the two countries.The Indian Army has consistently provided support during crises in Nepal, including being the first to respond after the 2015 earthquake with search, rescue, and relief operations. \nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indian Army extended various assistance including vaccines to supporting the Nepali Army and aiding citizens through relief materials and medical supplies.Nepal-India-Bangladesh energy agreement highlighting the increasing regional collaboration in energy trade and connectivity. India is involved in hydropower projects across Nepal’s rivers that will collectively generate 8,000 MW upon completion.\n\n\nIndia remains Nepal’s largest defense exporter and a reliable security partner, contributing significantly to Nepal’s military capabilities. Defense cooperation is pivotal in bolster military-to-military cooperation, emphasizing mutual trust, maintaining peace, addressing disputes, and strengthening mutual understanding.Nepal-India Energy Cooperation:\nNepal and India have been deepening energy cooperation in recent years, focusing on Nepal’s abundant clean energy resources, namely hydropower. On January 4, 2024, the two governments signed a landmark 25-year power trade agreement during Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar’s visit to Nepal. Under this agreement, Nepal will export 10,000 MW of electricity to India within the next decade. Notably, India’s Cabinet had already approved the purchase of this power on September 5, 2023. The agreement is set to auto-renew every 10 years after the initial 25-year term, enabling medium- and long-term power purchase agreements spanning 5-10 years.\nDespite legal challenges, the Supreme Court of Nepal upheld the validity of the deal. This agreement highlights the growing synergy between the two nations in the energy sector. Nepal aims to generate 13,000 MW of electricity by 2030 and 28,500 MW by 2035 to meet both domestic and foreign export demands. With its domestic electricity needs projected to reach 13,000 MW by 2035, Nepal has targeted exporting 10,000 MW to India over the next decade and 5,000 MW to Bangladesh by 2035. Achieving these ambitious goals requires significant hydropower development to produce around 28,000 MW within the next 10 years, emphasizing Nepal’s growing role as a regional clean energy hub.\nOne of the most successful areas of the India-Nepal bilateral cooperation is the power sector. The Joint Vision Statement on Power Sector Cooperation on April 2, 2022, during the visit of Nepal’s Prime Minister to India, outlined a comprehensive roadmap for collaboration. Key pillars of this cooperation include the joint development of power generation projects in Nepal, the development of cross-border transmission infrastructure, bi-directional power trade, coordinated operation of national grids, and institutional collaboration in sharing the latest operational information, technology, and expertise. Significant progress is already visible, with Nepal estimated to earn approximately NPR 10-15 crores per day through power exports to India.\nIndian investments in Nepal’s hydropower sector have created a significant market and investment opportunities, making Indian involvement pivotal. As a result, Nepal has not actively sought alternatives or third-country participation in its hydropower sector.\nIn October, 2024, Nepal, India, and Bangladesh signed a historic trilateral agreement to trade 40 MW of electricity from Nepal, marking the first time Nepal was able to export power to a third country. This milestone underscores the evolving regional energy cooperation facilitated through Indian infrastructure.\nNepal and India aim to establish infrastructure capable of supporting the transmission of 12,700 MW of electricity by 2030, with several key projects underway. Among these is the 400 kV Dhalkebar-Sitamarhi transmission line, which will have a capacity of 2,500 MW and is dedicated to exporting power from the Arun III hydropower project. This line is expected to become operational by 2025/26. Additionally, the 132 kV Nepalgunj-Nanpara line with a 200 MW capacity is slated for completion by the same year.\nOther major 400 kV cross-border transmission projects include New Butwal-Gorakhpur, Inaruwa-Purnea, and Kohalpur-Lucknow, collectively capable of transmitting up to 2,500 MW.\nIn a significant development for regional energy trade, Nepal, India, and Bangladesh have signed a trilateral agreement to export 40 MW of electricity to Bangladesh. This trade marks the first instance of Nepal being allowed to sell electricity to a third country through Indian transmission infrastructure.NEA exported approximately 1.76 billion units of electricity worth Rs. 13.04 billion to India from July 16 to December 15, 2024, in the current fiscal year 2024/25.\n\nNepal-India-Bangladesh energy agreement highlighting the increasing regional collaboration in energy trade and connectivity. India is involved in hydropower projects across Nepal’s rivers that will collectively generate 8,000 MW upon completion.Several Indian companies are actively participating in Nepal’s hydropower development, underscoring the deepening energy ties between the two nations.\nIndian State-owned SJVN Limited is developing the 769 MW Tamor Hydropower Project in the Arun Basin and has also acquired the 679 MW Lower Arun project. The Arun-4 hydropower project, with a capacity of 490 MW, has been awarded to Sutlej Jal Vidyut Nigam (SJVN), a joint venture with India’s state-owned Sutlej Hydropower Corporation, which is already working on the upstream 900 MW Arun-3 project.\nIndia’s NHPC Limited (National Hydroelectric Power Corporation) has taken on the ambitious 750 MW West Seti hydropower project, further cementing its presence in Nepal’s energy sector.\nThe 900 MW Upper Karnali Hydroelectric Project, awarded in 2014, and other projects like West Seti and Upper Karnali will contribute an additional 2,000 MW of electricity from western Nepal for export to India. Together, these investments highlight India’s significant role in harnessing Nepal’s hydropower potential.\nEnergy remains a cornerstone of India-Nepal relations, with cross-border electricity trade gaining significant momentum in recent years through numerous agreements and infrastructure developments. Emerging shifts in \nCooperation in electricity generation focused in mutual benefit for both nations. The signing of the Agreement on Electric Power Trade, Cross-Border Transmission Interconnections, and Grid Connectivity in October 2014 marked a milestone in Nepal-India energy relations. This agreement, initiated under Prime Minister Modi’s HIT (Highways, I-ways, and Transways) initiative, was a key outcome of his first foreign visit to Nepal. At the time, Nepal was grappling with over 18 hours of daily load shedding.\nIndia’s Conduct of Business Rule (CBR) of February 2021 stipulated that it would only import electricity from neighboring countries with formal energy trade agreements. In November 2021, India granted Nepal permission to sell surplus electricity in line with the Cross Border Trade of Electricity (CBTE) guidelines. Nepal began exporting 39 MW of electricity to India via the 400 kV Muzaffarpur-Dhalkebar transmission line, a significant step in regional energy integration.\nThe Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) has received approval from India to sell 941 MW of electricity generated from 28 projects in the Indian market under competitive market and medium-term power sales agreements. Nepal initially secured approval in November 2021 to sell 39 MW in India’s Energy Exchange Market through the day-ahead market.Hinduism and Buddhism have been pivotal in enhancing cultural connectivity, with both countries sharing significant religious sites that form an integral part of their spiritual heritage. Completing a pilgrimage often requires visiting sites in both nations, symbolizing their intertwined cultural and religious history.\n\n This capacity was subsequently expanded to 346 MW in April 2022, further growing to 472 MW, and eventually reaching 941 MW. This progression highlights the increasing trade potential and growing energy cooperation between Nepal and India.NEA exported approximately 1.76 billion units of electricity worth Rs. 13.04 billion to India from July 16 to December 15, 2024, in the current fiscal year 2024/25. Export volumes could have been higher if not for disruptions caused by floods and landslides in late September, which damaged the 456 MW Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Project. NEA had set a target to export electricity worth Rs. 30 billion for the current fiscal year. However, this goal is impacted due to the damage sustained by hydropower projects and transmission lines from the natural disasters.\nIndia has also committed to developing key hydropower projects in Nepal, including Arun-III, Lower Arun, Upper Karnali, and Pancheshwar. These storage-based projects aim to generate electricity during non-peak periods and export surplus energy to India and other nations, ensuring mutual energy security and advancing bilateral cooperation. However, Nepal still needs to significantly enhance its transmission capacity to maximize these opportunities and facilitate robust energy trade.\nNepal has immense potential for renewable energy, particularly in hydropower and solar. Hydropower remains dominant in Nepal’s energy mix, contributing 95% of the total installed capacity. Studies estimate Nepal’s hydropower potential between 42,000 MW (economic and technical) and 130,000 MW (practical). Current projects under various stages of development include over 107 MW of solar energy, with 82 MW from private developers and 25 MW installed by the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA).\nTo achieve Nepal’s Paris Agreement goals of net-zero emissions by 2045 and the 15th periodic plan’s target of 20% renewable energy by 2030, Nepal aims to generate 5,000 MW of renewable energy by 2030. Indian investments will be vital in accelerating these efforts to strengthen Nepal’s renewable energy sector, ensuring regional energy security and economic growth.\nAccording to the Investment Board Nepal (IBN) report from April 2024, Nepal receives solar radiation capable of producing 3.6 to 6.2 kWh of electricity per square meter, with an average insolation intensity of 4.7 kWh per square meter per day and 300 sunny days annually. These conditions make solar energy a promising alternative, especially as installation costs continue to decline. However, substantial investments, particularly from Indian companies, are essential to unlock this potential.\nNepal-India Cultural Relations\nCultural relations form one of the key foundations of India-Nepal ties. India and Nepal share a deep-rooted cultural bond that is organic and historically significant. The people of Nepal and India share deep interdependence due to linguistic, ritualistic, cultural, marital, and other similarities. This connection is further strengthened by the open and harmonious border between the two countries, as well as economic interactions.  \nProminent pilgrimage sites such as Pashupatinath, Muktinath, Janakpurdham, and Lumbini in Nepal, alongside Char Dham, Varanasi, Ayodhya, and Bodhgaya in India, play an instrumental role in fostering unity between the two nations.India’s history of development cooperation with Nepal dates back to the 1950s, with major projects undertaken over the years, including the East-West Highway, the Nepal-Bharat Maitri Emergency and Trauma Centre (₹100 crore), BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences in Dharan, and the five-story OPD complex at Bir Hospital.\n\n Hinduism and Buddhism have been pivotal in enhancing cultural connectivity, with both countries sharing significant religious sites that form an integral part of their spiritual heritage. Completing a pilgrimage often requires visiting sites in both nations, symbolizing their intertwined cultural and religious history.The Indian government has invested considerable resources and effort in promoting people-to-people connections in art, culture, academics, and media. This includes organizing cultural programs, symposia, events, conferences, and seminars in collaboration with various institutions, further solidifying the cultural bond between the two nations. \nBollywood films and Indian TV shows enjoy immense popularity in Nepal. Hindi is widely understood by most Nepali speakers, while many regions in India have Nepali-speaking communities. The Government of India actively promotes people-to-people connections in various fields, including art, culture, academics, and media. This is achieved through cultural programs, symposia, and events organized in collaboration with local bodies in Nepal, as well as conferences and seminars in languages such as Hindi and Sanskrit.\nIn 2023, Nepal joined India in celebrating 75 years of “Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav” with a series of events showcasing music, dance, development partnerships, and startup collaborations. Established in August 2007, the Swami Vivekananda Centre for Indian Culture in Kathmandu continues to exhibit the best of Indian cultural heritage. Similarly, the Nepal-Bharat Library, founded in 1951 as the first foreign library in Nepal, plays a pivotal role in enhancing cultural ties and facilitating information exchange between the two countries.\nTo deepen educational and cultural cooperation, the B.P. Koirala India-Nepal Foundation was established in 1991. Its objective is to foster collaboration in education, culture, science, and technical fields, promoting mutual understanding and the sharing of professional expertise.\nAdditionally, efforts to strengthen media and academic partnerships include familiarization visits to India for Nepali journalists and editors, along with short-term training programs in print and electronic media, archaeology, and other areas of professional development. These initiatives continue to reinforce the unique cultural relationship between India and Nepal.\nNepal-India Development Partnership \nThe India-Nepal Development Partnership has been steadily expanding for over seven decades. Nepal is one of India’s largest and most prominent development partners. \nThis long-standing cooperation began in 1951 with the construction of the Gauchar Airport in Kathmandu, now known as Tribhuvan International Airport.

The 41-kilometer Raxaul-Amlekhgunj cross-border petroleum pipeline, South Asia’s first, was launched to transport petroleum products from India to Nepal. An MoU for this project was signed in August 2015. The India-Nepal Air Services Agreement, signed on February 16, 2010, allocates 30,000 seats per week in each direction, with India being the largest source of tourism to Nepal. India has provided four lines of credit totaling US$2.6 billion for infrastructure projects in Nepal, financing 36 road projects, six hydropower projects, and others in housing and reconstruction. Iconic projects include the Solu Corridor, Muzaffarpur-Dhalkebar Transmission Line, and Devighat Hydro Project. Future funding for the Bheri Corridor and other transmission lines has also been secured.A Letter of Exchange (LoE) signed on July 9, 2021, enables all cargo train operators to utilize the Indian railway network to carry containers bound for or originating from Nepal, whether for bilateral or third-country freight. This new arrangement is expected to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and benefit Nepali consumers.\nThe Nepal-India Treaty of Trade (2009), Agreement on Cooperation to Control Unauthorized Trade (2009), Treaty of Transit (1999), and Rail Services Agreement (2004) provide the bilateral framework for trade and transit. Under the Treaty of Trade, Nepali-manufactured goods enjoy duty-free access to the Indian market on a non-reciprocal basis, with a short negative list (including cigarettes, alcohol, and cosmetics). To qualify for duty-free market access, export items must meet the criteria of a 30% domestic value addition and a change in the four-digit HS classification during processing in Nepal.\nBilateral trade typically takes place in Indian rupees, and Nepal’s central bank maintains a list of 163 items that can be imported from India in dollars using a Letter of Credit. The Indian rupee is fully convertible in Nepal, and the exchange rate is set at NRs. 1.6 per Indian rupee.\nThe Indian cooperation started in 1952 with the construction of an air-strip at Gaucharan. Since then, India has been continue economic assistance to Nepal. India has supported various key projects in Nepal, including the B.P. Koirala Institute of Health Sciences in Dharan, the Emergency and Trauma Centre at Bir Hospital in Kathmandu, and the Manmohan Memorial Polytechnic in Biratnagar, all of which have been completed and are operational under Indian assistance.\nAdditionally, integrated check-posts (ICPs) have been proposed at four points along the Indo-Nepal border: (i) Raxaul-Birganj (completed and operational since April 2018), (ii) Sunauli-Bhairahawa, (iii) Jogbani-Biratnagar, and (iv) Nepalganj Road-Nepalgunj. Construction of the ICP in Biratnagar is ongoing, while procedures for the ones in Bhairahawa and Nepalgunj are underway. Construction of Terai roads under Phase I has already started.\nThe 2009 Agreement for Cooperation between India and Nepal to Control Unauthorized Trade provides a legal framework for curbing illegal trade. The Nepal-India Treaty of Transit (1992), renewed every seven years, ensures port access to Nepal at Kolkata/Haldia and Visakhapatnam and specifies designated transit routes to the Nepal-India border. For bilateral trade, 27 entry/exit points are set along the border.\nAn MoU for the development of railway infrastructure at five points along the Nepal-India border was signed in 2010. Construction is underway for the Jayanagar-Janakpur-Bardibas-Bijalpura and Jogbani-Biratnagar sectors, while preliminary work has started on the remaining three links. Additionally, an MoU was signed on 16 February 2010 in New Delhi for the establishment of the Nepal Bharat Maitri Polytechnic in Hetauda, Makawanpur District, Nepal, and the project is currently being implemented.\nThe Rail Services Agreement, 2004, initially limited to the transit point between Kolkata/Haldia port and Raxaul/Birgunj, was expanded in 2016 to include Vishakhapatnam Port. A Letter of Exchange (LoE) signed on July 9, 2021, enables all cargo train operators to utilize the Indian railway network to carry containers bound for or originating from Nepal, whether for bilateral or third-country freight. This new arrangement is expected to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and benefit Nepali consumers.\n"},{"hash":"93ae26cbb3c2469cbf2784e9f814f00254c4d92909d27520a541645bd9090f5a","title":"bird-strike-warning-issued-shortly-before-jeju-airplane-crash-in-muan-ministry","date":1735430400000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/global/bird-strike-warning-issued-shortly-before-jeju-airplane-crash-in-muan-ministry","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/Plane_crash_South_Korea_Reuters1735438765_1024.png","category":"global","content":"\n    SEOUL:  An airport control tower had warned of a bird strike just six minutes before a Jeju Air passenger jet carrying 181 people crashed in South Korea's southwestern county of Muan, the transport ministry said Sunday.Officials earlier said the accident happened at around 9:07 a.m., when the Jeju Air flight veered off the runway while landing and collided with a fence wall at Muan International Airport in Muan County, South Jeolla Province, 288 kilometers southwest of Seoul.\nAccording to a press briefing of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, which oversees aviation safety, the control tower issued the warning at 8:57 a.m.\nThe pilot of the aircraft declared mayday at 8:59 a.m., not 8:58 a.m. as the ministry had said earlier Sunday.

The cooperatives will not deposit the money without disclosing its source, reads the ordinance.Amending some Nepal laws on cooperatives, the Cabinet meeting of December 24 had decided to introduce an ordinance related to the cooperatives and forwarded it to the President. Paudel issued it on Sunday. According to Shailaja Regmi Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Office of the President, the President issued the ordinance as per Article 114 (1) of the constitution on the recommendation of the Council of Ministers.The new law prohibits members or borrowers from becoming members of more than one cooperative. However, this ordinance also makes it mandatory for a person who is a member of more than one cooperative organisation of the same nature at the time of its commencement to maintain membership in only one organisation.The ordinance also classifies cooperatives at the federal, provincial and local levels and makes provisions for issuing loans accordingly, while the term of directors has also been reduced to two years.With the ordinance in force, cooperatives that primarily engage in savings and credits will now have to protect savings by becoming a member of the Deposit and Credit Protection Fund.The ordinance amends some clauses of the Cooperative Act-2017, the Rastra Bank Act-2002, while the Deposit and Credit Guarantee Fund Act-2016 has been revised too. As the winter session of Parliament is yet to start, these Acts were amended through an ordinance. The ordinance also makes provisions for conciliation. “If a defendant is accused of embezzling the funds of a cooperative or defrauding the cooperative under Section 130 and a case is pending in court, any such criminal case can be conciliated under the prevailing law,” reads the ordinance. “A conciliation may be made if the member requests a settlement after the savings or embezzled funds have been returned.”The ordinance also makes it clear that there is no scope for settlement in cases related to organised crime, money laundering, and other criminal offences where settlement is not possible under prevailing law.The ordinance establishes a National Cooperative Regulatory Authority to regulate savings and credit cooperatives, abolishes the National Cooperative Development Board Act 1992, and mandates the return of up to Rs500,000 in depositor savings as a priority.In the case of savings exceeding Rs500,000, the concerned organisation should make provisions for paying the member’s savings proportionally by setting standards if it is not possible to pay them at once.After the disbanding of the National Cooperative Development Board, its movable and immovable assets and liabilities and employees will automatically be transferred to the authority, said Ganesh Prasad Bhatta, spokesperson for the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation.“The National Cooperative Development Board had its limitations,” Bhatta added, “due to which it failed to address the issues related to the cooperatives under the country’s federal set-up.”The authority will be able to address problems related to federal, provincial and local level cooperatives, Bhatta said.It will also permit the sale of collateral to repay loans if borrowers fail to clear debts, ensure transparency in cooperative registration and classification, and regulate individual savings and credit limits.According to the new provisions, the cooperatives can lease or sell assets to obtain funds for deposit repayments. These measures aim to protect depositors while promoting accountability in the cooperatives sector.But Kashi Raj Dahal, the former chair of the Crisis-Ridden Cooperatives Management Committee, a government agency, says that while forming a regulatory authority is good in itself, its effectiveness depends on the government’s action.The regulatory authority will address the problems that will arise in the future, but it remains to be seen how the problems faced by the current depositors will be solved, Dahal says. “Those who embezzled cooperatives’ money might have sold their properties and fled the country,” Dahal says. “The government should be able to assure the depositors that their money is safe.”The regulatory authority monitoring the three tiers of the cooperatives might face challenges in the future. “How will the government address the issue if a conflict of jurisdiction arises between the federal, provincial and local levels while monitoring the cooperatives? That should be clear at the outset,” Dahal cautioned. Similarly, no cooperative will be able to lend more than 15 percent of its primary capital.Maha Prasad Adhikari, the governor of Nepal Rastra Bank, has said that problems in the cooperative sector stem from unlimited collection of deposits.Adhikari expressed this view during his meeting with the Parliamentary Special Investigation Committee led by Surya Thapa which also had lawmakers from the Nepali Congress, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the Rastriya Prajantra Party in July. The probe committee had invited a wide range of persons to discuss measures to address the problem of cooperatives. Other issues pointed out during the discussions were lack of geographical boundaries of cooperatives, absence of an effective regulatory body, and poor supervision.

Other issues pointed out during the discussions were lack of geographical boundaries of cooperatives, absence of an effective regulatory body, and poor supervision.

It is the second most common injury in rural Nepal, accounting for 5 percent of disabilities, according to the World Health Organisation.In October, the government decided to provide free treatment to impoverished burn victims. However, even two months after the declaration, the free scheme has not been implemented in any hospital. Poor burn victims and their relatives are forced to pay their medical bills.“The work procedure sent to us by the government is not specific, as it does not say anything about who would get free treatment, what would be the process of reimbursement, and budget arrangements, among other things,” said Dr Kiran Nakarmi, director at Kirtipur Hospital.“We do not deprive patients of treatment just because they cannot afford to pay medical bills. But many patients would easily get free treatment if the work procedure had been detailed.”Had the government decision been implemented on time, poor burn victims like Jha seeking care at Kirtipur Hospital and other state-run health facilities including Bir Hospital of Bagmati Province, BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences of Koshi Province, Narayani Hospital in Madhesh Province and Pokhara Institute of Health Sciences of Gandaki Province would not have been forced to foot their costly medical bills.Likewise, patients would also get free treatment at Bheri Hospital of Lumbini Province, Surkhet Provincial Hospital of Karnali Province and Seti Provincial Hospital of Sudurpaschim Province.Minister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel has been announcing one free scheme after another but is seemingly unbothered about their implementation. The Post’s attempts to contact Minister Paudel could not succeed.“We heard of the free scheme for burn victims from the media but we are yet to get any instruction or the budget to implement it,” said Dr Peeyush Dahal, chief of the Burns and Plastic Surgery Unit at Bir Hospital. “Many burn victims can’t afford to pay medical bills even if Bir hospital does not charge much for treatment.”Meanwhile, the number of burn incidents has risen nationwide, amid declining temperatures. As people make bonfires to stay warm, the number of burn cases has increased alarmingly, according to the Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre in Kirtipur [Kirtipur Hospital].“In the summer, we have around 20 burn patients a day, but the number rises to double that and even more in the winter months,” Nakarmi said. “We have 37 patients today [Sunday], and five of them were brought on Saturday night. Most of the victims were burnt while sitting by the fire.”Elderly women and under-age children are more vulnerable to fire incidents, as they remain in the house or near fireplaces most of the time. They have a weaker immune system than adults, and that makes the recovery process more complicated for them, according to doctors.Every winter, the hospital converts other general wards to burn units due to a massive influx of burn victims.Doctors say awareness alone can substantially increase the burn patients’ chances of survival. “Don’t leave small children and elderly people close to the fire,” said Nakarmi. “Risk of women getting injured in fire is high, as the sari they wear can catch fire quickly.”Experts suggest not letting children play near fire. Turning one’s back to fire and burning logs while sleeping at night is also dangerous, according to them.Burn patients need enough intravenous fluids, around eight litres in 24 hours. But fulfilling this intake criteria is often not possible while transporting patients from one facility to another, which reduces their chances of survival.The Ministry of Health and Population estimates that each year 55,000 people throughout the country suffer burn injuries.One past study shows that over 40,000 people sustain burn injuries (minor or severe) in Nepal every year.

Police have been investigating the case.“The negligence of Xavier International College, Boudha Tusal ended the life of my 19-year-old niece, Gungun Tamang,” Bina Theeng Tamang, a poet and writer, wrote on Facebook on December 25.On December 23, Xavier International College took 63 students pursuing Bachelor’s degrees to Scout Hill in Kakani, over 15 kilometres northwest of Balaju, for orientation. That night, they had a campfire, and Gungun Tamang, a Bachelor of Business Studies (BBS) student, suddenly fainted while enjoying the company of her friends.“The college had signed the consent letter to the parents about the orientation programme, but they did not do a timely rescue to save the life of my niece,” Tamang said. Gungun had no health issues before that, according to Tamang.A Xavier International student who participated in the outing also accused the teachers of not promptly rushing her to the hospital. After Gungun fainted, the teachers took her to a room, made her sleep, and left her in the presence of her friend, the student said. Then, they rejoined the campfire.A few students pursuing a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree said the teacher did not consider cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but some students did. “Only after one of our friends made a video call to his home and consulted with a family member, who is a medical person, were we suggested to take Gungun immediately to the hospital, as her condition was critical,” one of the students told the Post on the condition of anonymity.“Only after we conveyed this to our teachers did they show concern.”According to the students, the college did not have its vehicle there, so the teachers first tried to find a vehicle to rescue her, but it took time to do so.An Armed Police Force United Nations Peacekeeping Training School is near Scout Hill in Kakani. The school staff initially thought about taking Gungun there on a motorbike. However, another student who had participated in the orientation programme said that since Gungun was unconscious, it was not possible for her to ride pillion.The teachers managed a vehicle from the Armed Police Force and two medical personnel of the Police team to take Gungun to Green City Hospital in Samakhushi. According to hospital records obtained by the Post, by the time she was brought to the hospital, it was 10:40 at night. The hospital declared the patient ‘brought dead’. Though she fainted around 8:30 in the evening, the college staff didn’t rescue her immediately, the students allege.She could have probably been saved had the teachers shown immediate concern and made necessary arrangements promptly, the students the Post spoke to said.A student said the college had around 10 staff members for the outing, including teachers and other supporting staff.According to Gungun’s postmortem report, she didn’t suffer a stroke or a heart attack, and the report claims it was a natural death. However, the family members decry the college’s negligence.“She must have fainted due to the fluctuating temperature, and we also learned that while burning a fire, the college staff had used turpentine oil, which is injurious to health,” Tamang said. “My niece died at such a young age for a lack of timely treatment.”However, college coordinator Rajesh Nepal denies using turpentine oil to burn fire. He, however, acknowledges burning plastics. “We had used plastics to light the firewood,” Nepal said.Burning turpentine oil or plastic is injurious to health, says Binjawala Shrestha, a public health expert. “However, in Gungun’s case, I cannot give my definite opinion without studying the case in detail,” Shrestha says.On December 26, Gungun’s family members filed a case against the college with the Crime Investigation Department (CID) of the Nepal Police.College officials have denied the allegations. Nepal, the college coordinator, said it is natural for family members to blame the college staff for their loss. “We understand they are in pain,” Nepal said. “However, we as college staff did all we could to save her life… Within 2-3 hours of the incident, we brought her to the hospital. I had come with the police medical team to the hospital, bringing Gungun. It took us some time to make full arrangements since the college did not have its vehicle on standby.”Nepal Police Spokesperson Bishwa Adhikari says that death cases of students while on education tours are reported often. However, the number is not that big, he said.For people working in the education sector, taking students on a field trip for educational purposes is not conceptually wrong.

Parents and educational institutions should also share the students' health histories, but there is a lack of such practices, according to them.“Parents should send their children to such programmes only after confirming that the safety measures are properly followed,” said Medini Lamichhane, an education expert. “And educational institutions along with parents should be aware of the students’ health history so they can properly take care of them in case of emergency.”Lamichhane added that the education sector in the country lacks proper regulations on this issue, and it is high time a policy is formulated.

He had direct and indirect involvement in the peace deals even before the Maoists joined mainstream politics. Currently a chair at the Nepal Transition to Peace, an organisation with a long history of peace facilitation, Mallik has closely followed the developments in the transitional justice process. With the process at a crossroads after the committee to select the office-bearers in two transitional justice commissions failed to accomplish its task, the Post’s Binod Ghimire sat with him to talk about the future course of transitional justice. Excerpts: Amid growing hope, the transitional justice process has stalled again after the selection committee failed to recommend the chairs and members of the two transitional justice commissions. What do you think went wrong?Based on my conversations with some members of the recommendation committee, I can say that differences in the panel over the name of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission chair led to the failure of the selection. While members [representing different parties] wanted to pick someone [Sudip Pathak] pushed by political parties, even with heavy hearts, others warned to register dissent in the decision. Instead of recommending names through a majority decision, the committee chose not to recommend anyone.It is painful to see the process stall. After several open and secret negotiations between the major forces, including the Nepal Army, the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry and Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act was amended. We facilitated many such negotiations. The amendment became possible only after the CPN-UML and its chair, KP Sharma Oli, an incumbent prime minister, were convinced. Amendment to the Act had created a positive environment.However, the old habits of the parties in power—the Nepali Congress in this case—to fit their people in every institution sabotaged the hard-built positive environment. This is unfortunate.Don’t you think it was insincere on the part of the former chief justice-led committee to exhaust its deadline without completing its duty?This is not uncommon in our country. But I don’t mean there was no problem with the committee itself. I see problems in its composition and also in its terms of reference (ToR). There were doubts over the committee right from its formation, after the same person [Om Prakash Mishra] was entrusted with the responsibility of selecting the office-bearers for the second time. Despite the selection panel not inspiring much hope, the victims and other stakeholders had critical engagement because “something was better than nothing.” Also, the criteria set by the TJ Act for the chairs of the commissions don’t reflect the skills those leading the transitional justice process need. This is not a court proceeding where one needs to be a Supreme Court justice. The criteria need to be revised through an amendment to the Act. The ToR for the selection committee has been devised in a way that it would, for example, select a chief executive officer in a company or a head of some government offices. The ritualistic and formal selection process cannot find the best-suited persons to lead the transitional justice proceedings. Only those who can connect with the victims or dig out the information related to the perpetrators can lead the commissions to success. Nobody will reveal the truth unless s/he trusts and has faith in the persons leading the commissions.The selection committee could have recommended anyone from the shortlist it had prepared. However, I fail to believe they would have seen to the success of the process.Do you agree with the prime minister’s claim that only political figures can lead this process?I agree to the extent that we need a towering personality who has connections with common people. However, the Act seeks technical qualities in the chairs of the commissions, a provision which needs to be revised. Technocrats cannot lead them. A political figure can lead the process, but s/he should be widely acceptable among the stakeholders and should be able to resist the petty partisan interest.Transitional justice is often taken as a political process. Again, there are concerns about politicisation. What is the demarcation line for political engagement?Being political and being into partisan politics are two different issues. For instance, Padma Ratna Tuladhar, despite getting elected with the UML’s election symbol, held an independent image. We can find such figures who can throw away their political hats once they take vital responsibilities. They can win the trust of the victims while also engaging the perpetrators.

He had direct and indirect involvement in the peace deals even before the Maoists joined mainstream politics. Currently a chair at the Nepal Transition to Peace, an organisation with a long history of peace facilitation, Mallik has closely followed the developments in the transitional justice process. With the process at a crossroads after the committee to select the office-bearers in two transitional justice commissions failed to accomplish its task, the Post’s Binod Ghimire sat with him to talk about the future course of transitional justice. Excerpts: Amid growing hope, the transitional justice process has stalled again after the selection committee failed to recommend the chairs and members of the two transitional justice commissions. What do you think went wrong?Based on my conversations with some members of the recommendation committee, I can say that differences in the panel over the name of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission chair led to the failure of the selection. While members [representing different parties] wanted to pick someone [Sudip Pathak] pushed by political parties, even with heavy hearts, others warned to register dissent in the decision. Instead of recommending names through a majority decision, the committee chose not to recommend anyone.It is painful to see the process stall. After several open and secret negotiations between the major forces, including the Nepal Army, the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry and Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act was amended. We facilitated many such negotiations. The amendment became possible only after the CPN-UML and its chair, KP Sharma Oli, an incumbent prime minister, were convinced. Amendment to the Act had created a positive environment.However, the old habits of the parties in power—the Nepali Congress in this case—to fit their people in every institution sabotaged the hard-built positive environment. This is unfortunate.Don’t you think it was insincere on the part of the former chief justice-led committee to exhaust its deadline without completing its duty?This is not uncommon in our country. But I don’t mean there was no problem with the committee itself. I see problems in its composition and also in its terms of reference (ToR). There were doubts over the committee right from its formation, after the same person [Om Prakash Mishra] was entrusted with the responsibility of selecting the office-bearers for the second time. Despite the selection panel not inspiring much hope, the victims and other stakeholders had critical engagement because “something was better than nothing.” Also, the criteria set by the TJ Act for the chairs of the commissions don’t reflect the skills those leading the transitional justice process need. This is not a court proceeding where one needs to be a Supreme Court justice. The criteria need to be revised through an amendment to the Act. The ToR for the selection committee has been devised in a way that it would, for example, select a chief executive officer in a company or a head of some government offices. The ritualistic and formal selection process cannot find the best-suited persons to lead the transitional justice proceedings. Only those who can connect with the victims or dig out the information related to the perpetrators can lead the commissions to success. Nobody will reveal the truth unless s/he trusts and has faith in the persons leading the commissions.The selection committee could have recommended anyone from the shortlist it had prepared. However, I fail to believe they would have seen to the success of the process.Do you agree with the prime minister’s claim that only political figures can lead this process?I agree to the extent that we need a towering personality who has connections with common people. However, the Act seeks technical qualities in the chairs of the commissions, a provision which needs to be revised. Technocrats cannot lead them. A political figure can lead the process, but s/he should be widely acceptable among the stakeholders and should be able to resist the petty partisan interest.Transitional justice is often taken as a political process. Again, there are concerns about politicisation. What is the demarcation line for political engagement?Being political and being into partisan politics are two different issues. For instance, Padma Ratna Tuladhar, despite getting elected with the UML’s election symbol, held an independent image. We can find such figures who can throw away their political hats once they take vital responsibilities. They can win the trust of the victims while also engaging the perpetrators. While discharging their duties, they can stay uninfluenced by the leadership of the party that chose them.It is not possible to find a universally accepted character in such a fragmented society, where even conflict victims remain poles apart on several issues. The best-suited candidate to lead the process can ensure the critical engagement of all concerned stakeholders.On the other hand, political parties must understand that their role is limited to facilitating the process.

On a positive note, of late, there has been a decent decrease in wholesale vegetable prices at Kathmandu’s main distributor, the Kalimati fruit and vegetable market. The price of cauliflowers from Tarai has dropped by 61 percent a kg in just a week. While this vegetable was priced at Rs65 per kg on December 21, it now costs only Rs25 as of Sunday, December 29. Similarly, local cauliflower, sold at the same price as the Tarai cauliflower last week, was going for Rs40 on the same day. Prices of tomatoes, potatoes, cabbages, beans, etc., have also plummeted. Nonetheless, in retail markets across the country, these veggies still cost customers an arm and a leg. Yet local governments and regulatory bodies like the Department of Commerce, Supplies and Consumer Protection have failed to intervene and regulate market prices. Vegetables go through a long supply before entering our kitchens, and product prices are increasing in the retail market, given the unavoidable transport costs, distance, spoilage and packaging. However, retailers and middlemen often exploit such reasons and make customers pay through the nose.

Shifting snowfall and rainfall patterns due to climate change increase the region’s vulnerability. Cloudburst events are becoming more frequent, glaciers are retreating at an accelerated pace, snowfall is declining and permafrost is melting, leading to a cascade of multi-hazard events that cause substantial damage.While significant attention has been given to mapping glacial lakes larger than 0.02 square kilometres and monitoring a few potentially dangerous ones, other critical hazards, such as permafrost degradation and smaller, undocumented glacial lakes, have been overlooked. Additionally, there has been insufficient focus on minimising vulnerability and exposure downstream, which are the key components of disaster risk reduction.Glacial lake outburst floodsGlacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) occur when meltwater from glaciers accumulates behind an ice or moraine dam, which can fail due to overtopping caused by rising water levels or collapse resulting from melting of the ice core within the moraine dam. This failure often triggers external events such as avalanches or landslides into the lake. The GLOF event in April this year at Birendra Lake in Gorkha, Nepal, highlights the severe impact of glacier ice cascading into the lake. This sudden influx caused a sharp rise in water levels, leading to an overflow that inundated downstream areas. Earthquakes may also trigger the GLOF. The 2015 Gorkha earthquake brought about a GLOF in the Langtang Valley by destabilising the Langtang Glacier. The sudden release of large volumes of water generates catastrophic floods that can overwhelm river channels and pose severe risks to nearby communities and critical infrastructure like hydropower and bridges.On August 16, 2024, a GLOF devastated Thame, a Sherpa village in the Khumbu region, destroying 25 structures, including homes, guesthouses, a school and a hydropower project, while displacing 135 people. Additionally, the Khumbu region was severely impacted by the Dig Tsho GLOF in 1985, which caused widespread destruction, including the loss of lives, property and infrastructure. The 2021 Melamchi debris flow was triggered by monsoon rainfall and landslides and exacerbated by upstream glacial melt, leading to devastating floods and sediment-laden flows. Similarly, the 2012 Seti River flash flood in Pokhara was caused by a landslide-induced dam breach upstream, which released a massive volume of water, highlighting the cascading risks associated with glacial melt and moraine instability linked to GLOF phenomena. All these GLOF-related events underline the need for robust multihazard early warning systems, risk mitigation measures and strong design of critical infrastructures.In the Himalaya, GLOFs can trigger a series of landslide dam outburst floods (LDOFs) by releasing large volumes of water that destabilise slopes or transport debris downstream, causing landslides that dam rivers. The sudden surge of water and debris from a GLOF can block a river course, forming a temporary dam, which, if breached, results in a catastrophic LDOF.The recent Thame GLOF is a stark reminder of the urgent need for better disaster risk management and more comprehensive monitoring strategies in the Himalaya. It also points to a crucial gap in existing glacial lake inventories. This lake was not included in the inventory because its size fell below the minimum threshold for classification as a glacial lake. Despite its small size, the flood caused significant downstream damage, destroying houses and infrastructure. The potential for widespread destruction is immense, with thousands of such lakes scattered across the Himalaya.Permafrost degradationPermafrost is a soil, rock, or sediment layer that remains frozen for at least two consecutive years, typically found in polar and high-altitude regions. But this is rapidly degrading due to rising temperatures. This thawing process weakens moraine dams, increasing the risk of GLOFs. Thorthormi Lake in Bhutan is classified as high-risk because of permafrost degradation. Furthermore, thawing releases loose debris, which triggers debris flows during heavy rainfall or snowmelt. In India’s Ladakh region, recurring debris flows caused by permafrost degradation have severely impacted local communities and infrastructure. Another consequence of permafrost thaw is increased sedimentation in rivers and reservoirs. Thawed permafrost accelerates erosion, contributing to higher sediment loads, as observed in Pakistan’s Indus River Basin. This disrupts river dynamics and reduces the efficiency of hydropower projects or threatens the bridges.Permafrost thawing in Nepal is a critical yet overlooked issue, with no systematic monitoring or comprehensive studies to assess its status and impacts. The lack of awareness and action on this phenomenon leaves communities vulnerable to landslides, glacial lake outbursts, floods and sedimentation.Building resilienceGlacier retreat and permafrost thaw also undermine the stability of mountain slopes and infrastructure integrity. As glaciers and permafrost diminish, the once-stabilised rocks are now exposed, increasing the risk of landslides and debris flow. Several studies have reported the growing trend of large landslides and debris flow in the Himalayas over the last decade, which is associated with glacier decline.In the Hindu Kush Himalaya, the rising temperatures caused by climate change driving glacier melt and permafrost degradation is a global phenomenon, and reversing or halting these processes is beyond the practical scope of localised or national efforts. Reducing global warming or the effect of climate change is a long-term challenge, requiring worldwide commitment and immediate action. Similarly, while efforts like lowering water levels in glacial lakes are technically possible in select cases, as done with Nepal’s Tsho Rolpa and Imja Tsho, they only provide temporary relief. They are not sustainable solutions given the thousands of lakes already formed and the hundreds that emerge annually due to accelerating glacier melt. Given these limitations, a pragmatic and effective strategy focusing on managing vulnerability to climate-induced hazards through innovative risk assessments, resilient infrastructure and community engagement is imperative. Critical infrastructure such as hydropower plants, bridges, roads and settlements must be designed to accommodate high hydraulic forces and debris flows. Infrastructure planning should integrate hazard mapping and predictive modelling to avoid high-risk zones and reduce exposure.In addition to physical infrastructure, strengthening multihazard early warning systems and enhancing community preparedness are vital. Combining technological advancements with local knowledge enables timely evacuation and risk mitigation, minimising human and economic losses. Community-based disaster risk reduction is also crucial. Empowering local populations through education, participatory mapping and hazard preparedness can significantly reduce disaster impacts. Additionally, integrating insurance and reinsurance mechanisms tailored for Himalayan risks can further encourage investment in resilient infrastructure.Investing in research and innovation is equally critical. Remote sensing and machine learning technologies can improve hazard monitoring and predictive modelling, offering new insights into glacial dynamics and risk patterns. Incorporating future climate scenarios into risk assessments will help policymakers and communities prepare for the uncertainties of climate change.This isn't a national problem, as glacial melting in Tibet can also pose risks to Nepal and India. There needs to be a consensus among the countries in the Hindu Kush region for collaboration and information sharing on glaciers across borders. We can only comprehensively monitor the dangers posed by retreating glaciers and effectively prepare for potential disasters through such cooperation.

In India’s Ladakh region, recurring debris flows caused by permafrost degradation have severely impacted local communities and infrastructure. Another consequence of permafrost thaw is increased sedimentation in rivers and reservoirs. Thawed permafrost accelerates erosion, contributing to higher sediment loads, as observed in Pakistan’s Indus River Basin. This disrupts river dynamics and reduces the efficiency of hydropower projects or threatens the bridges.Permafrost thawing in Nepal is a critical yet overlooked issue, with no systematic monitoring or comprehensive studies to assess its status and impacts. The lack of awareness and action on this phenomenon leaves communities vulnerable to landslides, glacial lake outbursts, floods and sedimentation.Building resilienceGlacier retreat and permafrost thaw also undermine the stability of mountain slopes and infrastructure integrity. As glaciers and permafrost diminish, the once-stabilised rocks are now exposed, increasing the risk of landslides and debris flow. Several studies have reported the growing trend of large landslides and debris flow in the Himalayas over the last decade, which is associated with glacier decline.In the Hindu Kush Himalaya, the rising temperatures caused by climate change driving glacier melt and permafrost degradation is a global phenomenon, and reversing or halting these processes is beyond the practical scope of localised or national efforts. Reducing global warming or the effect of climate change is a long-term challenge, requiring worldwide commitment and immediate action. Similarly, while efforts like lowering water levels in glacial lakes are technically possible in select cases, as done with Nepal’s Tsho Rolpa and Imja Tsho, they only provide temporary relief. They are not sustainable solutions given the thousands of lakes already formed and the hundreds that emerge annually due to accelerating glacier melt. Given these limitations, a pragmatic and effective strategy focusing on managing vulnerability to climate-induced hazards through innovative risk assessments, resilient infrastructure and community engagement is imperative. Critical infrastructure such as hydropower plants, bridges, roads and settlements must be designed to accommodate high hydraulic forces and debris flows. Infrastructure planning should integrate hazard mapping and predictive modelling to avoid high-risk zones and reduce exposure.In addition to physical infrastructure, strengthening multihazard early warning systems and enhancing community preparedness are vital. Combining technological advancements with local knowledge enables timely evacuation and risk mitigation, minimising human and economic losses. Community-based disaster risk reduction is also crucial. Empowering local populations through education, participatory mapping and hazard preparedness can significantly reduce disaster impacts. Additionally, integrating insurance and reinsurance mechanisms tailored for Himalayan risks can further encourage investment in resilient infrastructure.Investing in research and innovation is equally critical. Remote sensing and machine learning technologies can improve hazard monitoring and predictive modelling, offering new insights into glacial dynamics and risk patterns. Incorporating future climate scenarios into risk assessments will help policymakers and communities prepare for the uncertainties of climate change.This isn't a national problem, as glacial melting in Tibet can also pose risks to Nepal and India. There needs to be a consensus among the countries in the Hindu Kush region for collaboration and information sharing on glaciers across borders. We can only comprehensively monitor the dangers posed by retreating glaciers and effectively prepare for potential disasters through such cooperation.

What are the prospects for economic development and democratic evolution?Given the status of political party dynamics, geopolitical tussle and Nepal’s weak diplomatic capacity, Nepal’s prospects of economic development and democratic evolution look bleak at best. Oli’s efforts to emulate China’s growth model and political party discipline will also be undermined by the plurality of political parties and an ingrained kleptocratic system.GeopoliticsIn December, Nepal signed a landmark framework agreement with China on the Belt and Road Initiative after intense negotiations between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML on the one hand and between Nepal and China on the other. Nepal was able to revise and trim down China’s proposed “BRI Implementation Plan” according to Nepal’s priorities. However, Nepal’s proposal to develop the Nepal-China Friendship Park in Damak and consent to insert security and global initiatives in the joint communique, despite India’s concern, may have raised red flags.Nepal’s efforts to exercise strategic autonomy in the face of asymmetric power balance and geopolitical rivalry are undermined by several flaws. First, of course, is the political predilection, which heavily favours China. During several negotiations with China, Nepal’s bureaucracy and political leadership appear soft on China but hard on India. A series of events since 2008 shows that China has always favoured communist governments and that grants and aid disbursements tend to peak when leftist coalitions are in power.The second factor is Nepal’s inability to build trusted relations with China and India and ensure national interests. As China’s influence grows in Nepal, India has adopted a two-pronged policy of both engaging Nepal and adopting policy measures to limit the Chinese influence. There is a real possibility that India will continue to harden the border and create safeguards to limit Chinese access to the Indian market through Nepal. This will likely impact Nepal’s connectivity and trade with India in the future, which in turn will affect Nepal’s economic trajectory and viability of large infrastructure projects.The third is Nepali elites’ gradual alignment with Chinese interests and distancing from India. It has now become a paradox that while Nepal seeks to enjoy the privileges of the special arrangements ensured by the 1950 treaty with India, it wants to disregard India’s traditional interests in Nepal.One example is Pokhara Regional International Airport (PRIA). Two years after its inauguration, it has seen only 10 international flights, all of them chartered or relief efforts. The officials of CAAN do not have any reasonable near term strategy to make the airport financially viable or to service debts. The situation is so dire that an ordinary Airbus 319 flight from Pokhara to Kathmandu last week was highlighted with much fanfare by the Nepali media.Regional power dynamics, particularly with India, have affected the airport’s viability. When the PRIA was being considered, bilateral relations were invoked—the airport was framed as “critical” to Nepal-China relations. During its inauguration, China positioned the airport as part of BRI and the Trans Himalayan Multidimensional Connectivity Network.Media reports this week widely discussed the worsening relationship between Oli and India. Indian media reported that although Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba was on a private visit to India, she was disappointed not to meet senior leaders. She was hoping to push forward the agenda of Oli’s visit to India.

Membership in the entrenched national kleptocracy ensures that party leaders can extract resources from the state and obtain rent even if they do not hold any official public position.Nepal’s inability to address corruption and money laundering was reflected in the Mutual Evaluation Review of the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) on Money Laundering. Last week, the Nepal Rastra Bank governor, Maha Prasad Adhikari, gave dire news to the Prime Minister that the APG may be losing patience with Nepal.According to an expedited follow up report, Nepal has made some progress in addressing technical compliance deficiencies.

He wants to introduce tough disciplinary measures to “unify” the party and align every member around the top leadership. Only last week, the party took disciplinary action against three popular figures who dared to question Oli’s authoritarian streak and his hobnobbing with crony capitalists. The action created ripples in the political sphere although UML members kept quiet, indicating that exercising freedom of expression in the party would come at a great cost.A large chunk of the Nepali electorate is already ideologically aligned with leftist forces.

He also centralised regulatory and legal authorities and made selective use of power to weaken his political opponents.Incidents in the last few months indicate he has not changed.

He was 100.Carter, a Democrat, became president in January 1977 after defeating incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford in the 1976 election. His one-term presidency was marked by the highs of the 1978 Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt, bringing some stability to the Middle East.But it was also dogged by an economic recession, persistent unpopularity and the Iran hostage crisis that consumed his final 444 days in office. Carter ran for re-election in 1980 but was swept from office in a landslide as voters embraced Republican challenger Ronald Reagan, the former actor and California governor.Carter lived longer than any US president and, after leaving the White House, earned a reputation as a committed humanitarian. He was widely seen as a better former president than he was a president - a status he readily acknowledged.World leaders and former US presidents paid tribute to a man they praised as compassionate, humble and committed to peace in the Middle East.“His significant role in achieving the peace agreement between Egypt and Israel will remain etched in the annals of history,” said Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in a post on X.The Carter Center said there will be public observances in Atlanta and Washington. These events will be followed by a private interment in Plains, it said.Final arrangements for the former president’s state funeral are still pending, according to the center.In recent years, Carter had experienced several health issues including melanoma that spread to his liver and brain. Carter decided to receive hospice care in February 2023 instead of undergoing additional medical intervention. His wife, Rosalynn Carter, died on Nov. 19, 2023, at age 96. He looked frail when he attended her memorial service and funeral in a wheelchair.Carter left office profoundly unpopular but worked energetically for decades on humanitarian causes. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 in recognition of his “untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.”Carter had been a centrist as governor of Georgia with populist tendencies when he moved into the White House as the 39th US president. He was a Washington outsider at a time when America was still reeling from the Watergate scandal that led Republican Richard Nixon to resign as president in 1974 and elevated Ford from vice president.“I’m Jimmy Carter and I’m running for president. I will never lie to you,” Carter promised with an ear-to-ear smile.Asked to assess his presidency, Carter said in a 1991 documentary: “The biggest failure we had was a political failure. I never was able to convince the American people that I was a forceful and strong leader.”Despite his difficulties in office, Carter had few rivals for accomplishments as a former president. He gained global acclaim as a tireless human rights advocate, a voice for the disenfranchised and a leader in the fight against hunger and poverty, winning the respect that eluded him in the White House.Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his efforts to promote human rights and resolve conflicts around the world, from Ethiopia and Eritrea to Bosnia and Haiti. His Carter Center in Atlanta sent international election-monitoring delegations to polls around the world.A Southern Baptist Sunday school teacher since his teens, Carter brought a strong sense of morality to the presidency, speaking openly about his religious faith. He also sought to take some pomp out of an increasingly imperial presidency - walking, rather than riding in a limousine, in his 1977 inauguration parade.The Middle East was the focus of Carter’s foreign policy. The 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty, based on the 1978 Camp David accords, ended a state of war between the two neighbors.Carter brought Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland for talks. Later, as the accords seemed to be unraveling, Carter saved the day by flying to Cairo and Jerusalem for personal shuttle diplomacy.The treaty provided for Israeli withdrawal from Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula and establishment of diplomatic relations. Begin and Sadat each won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1978.By the 1980 election, the overriding issues were double-digit inflation, interest rates that exceeded 20% and soaring gas prices, as well as the Iran hostage crisis that brought humiliation to America. These issues marred Carter’s presidency and undermined his chances of winning a second term.HOSTAGE CRISISOn Nov. 4, 1979, revolutionaries devoted to Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had stormed the US Embassy in Tehran, seized the Americans present and demanded the return of the ousted shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was backed by the United States and was being treated in a US hospital.The American public initially rallied behind Carter. But his support faded in April 1980 when a commando raid failed to rescue the hostages, with eight US soldiers killed in an aircraft accident in the Iranian desert.Carter’s final ignominy was that Iran held the 52 hostages until minutes after Reagan took his oath of office on Jan. 20, 1981, to replace Carter, then released the planes carrying them to freedom.In another crisis, Carter protested the former Soviet Union’s 1979 invasion of Afghanistan by boycotting the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. He also asked the US Senate to defer consideration of a major nuclear arms accord with Moscow.Unswayed, the Soviets remained in Afghanistan for a decade.Carter won narrow Senate approval in 1978 of a treaty to transfer the Panama Canal to the control of Panama despite critics who argued the waterway was vital to American security. He also completed negotiations on full US ties with China.Carter created two new US Cabinet departments - education and energy. Amid high gas prices, he said America’s “energy crisis” was “the moral equivalent of war” and urged the country to embrace conservation. “Ours is the most wasteful nation on earth,” he told Americans in 1977.In 1979, Carter delivered what became known as his “malaise” speech to the nation, although he never used that word.“After listening to the American people I have been reminded again that all the legislation in the world can’t fix what’s wrong with America,” he said in his televised address.“The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America.”As president, the strait-laced Carter was embarrassed by the behavior of his hard-drinking younger brother, Billy Carter, who had boasted: “I got a red neck, white socks, and Blue Ribbon beer.”‘THERE YOU GO AGAIN’Jimmy Carter withstood a challenge from Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy for the 1980 Democratic presidential nomination but was politically diminished heading into his general election battle against a vigorous Republican adversary.Reagan, the conservative who projected an image of strength, kept Carter off balance during their debates before the November 1980 election.Reagan dismissively told Carter, “There you go again,” when the Republican challenger felt the president had misrepresented Reagan’s views during one debate.Carter lost the 1980 election to Reagan, who won 44 of the 50 states and amassed an Electoral College landslide.James Earl Carter Jr. was born on Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, one of four children of a farmer and shopkeeper. He graduated from the US Naval Academy in 1946, served in the nuclear submarine program and left to manage the family peanut farming business.He married his wife, Rosalynn, in 1946, a union he called “the most important thing in my life.” They had three sons and a daughter.Carter became a millionaire, a Georgia state legislator and Georgia’s governor from 1971 to 1975. He mounted an underdog bid for the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination, and out-hustled his rivals for the right to face Ford in the general election.With Walter Mondale as his vice presidential running mate, Carter was given a boost by a major Ford gaffe during one of their debates. Ford said that “there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration,” despite decades of just such domination.Carter edged Ford in the election, even though Ford actually won more states - 27 to Carter’s 23.Not all of Carter’s post-presidential work was appreciated. Former President George W. Bush and his father, former President George H.W. Bush, both Republicans, were said to have been displeased by Carter’s freelance diplomacy in Iraq and elsewhere.In 2004, Carter called the Iraq war launched in 2003 by the younger Bush one of the most “gross and damaging mistakes our nation ever made.” He called George W. Bush’s administration “the worst in history” and said Vice President Dick Cheney was “a disaster for our country.”In 2019, Carter questioned Republican Donald Trump’s legitimacy as president, saying “he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf.” Trump responded by calling Carter “a terrible president.”Carter also made trips to communist North Korea. A 1994 visit defused a nuclear crisis, as President Kim Il Sung agreed to freeze his nuclear program in exchange for resumed dialogue with the United States. That led to a deal in which North Korea, in return for aid, promised not to restart its nuclear reactor or reprocess the plant’s spent fuel.But Carter irked Democratic President Bill Clinton’s administration by announcing the deal with North Korea’s leader without first checking with Washington.In 2010, Carter won the release of an American sentenced to eight years hard labor for illegally entering North Korea.Carter wrote more than two dozen books, ranging from a presidential memoir to a children’s book and poetry, as well as works about religious faith and diplomacy. His book “Faith: A Journey for All,” was published in 2018.

Amid high gas prices, he said America’s “energy crisis” was “the moral equivalent of war” and urged the country to embrace conservation. “Ours is the most wasteful nation on earth,” he told Americans in 1977.In 1979, Carter delivered what became known as his “malaise” speech to the nation, although he never used that word.“After listening to the American people I have been reminded again that all the legislation in the world can’t fix what’s wrong with America,” he said in his televised address.“The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America.”As president, the strait-laced Carter was embarrassed by the behavior of his hard-drinking younger brother, Billy Carter, who had boasted: “I got a red neck, white socks, and Blue Ribbon beer.”‘THERE YOU GO AGAIN’Jimmy Carter withstood a challenge from Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy for the 1980 Democratic presidential nomination but was politically diminished heading into his general election battle against a vigorous Republican adversary.Reagan, the conservative who projected an image of strength, kept Carter off balance during their debates before the November 1980 election.Reagan dismissively told Carter, “There you go again,” when the Republican challenger felt the president had misrepresented Reagan’s views during one debate.Carter lost the 1980 election to Reagan, who won 44 of the 50 states and amassed an Electoral College landslide.James Earl Carter Jr. was born on Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, one of four children of a farmer and shopkeeper. He graduated from the US Naval Academy in 1946, served in the nuclear submarine program and left to manage the family peanut farming business.He married his wife, Rosalynn, in 1946, a union he called “the most important thing in my life.” They had three sons and a daughter.Carter became a millionaire, a Georgia state legislator and Georgia’s governor from 1971 to 1975. He mounted an underdog bid for the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination, and out-hustled his rivals for the right to face Ford in the general election.With Walter Mondale as his vice presidential running mate, Carter was given a boost by a major Ford gaffe during one of their debates. Ford said that “there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration,” despite decades of just such domination.Carter edged Ford in the election, even though Ford actually won more states - 27 to Carter’s 23.Not all of Carter’s post-presidential work was appreciated. Former President George W. Bush and his father, former President George H.W. Bush, both Republicans, were said to have been displeased by Carter’s freelance diplomacy in Iraq and elsewhere.In 2004, Carter called the Iraq war launched in 2003 by the younger Bush one of the most “gross and damaging mistakes our nation ever made.” He called George W. Bush’s administration “the worst in history” and said Vice President Dick Cheney was “a disaster for our country.”In 2019, Carter questioned Republican Donald Trump’s legitimacy as president, saying “he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf.” Trump responded by calling Carter “a terrible president.”Carter also made trips to communist North Korea. A 1994 visit defused a nuclear crisis, as President Kim Il Sung agreed to freeze his nuclear program in exchange for resumed dialogue with the United States. That led to a deal in which North Korea, in return for aid, promised not to restart its nuclear reactor or reprocess the plant’s spent fuel.But Carter irked Democratic President Bill Clinton’s administration by announcing the deal with North Korea’s leader without first checking with Washington.In 2010, Carter won the release of an American sentenced to eight years hard labor for illegally entering North Korea.Carter wrote more than two dozen books, ranging from a presidential memoir to a children’s book and poetry, as well as works about religious faith and diplomacy. His book “Faith: A Journey for All,” was published in 2018.

Many villages, including Chitai, Dolphu, Kimri, Takha, and Khari in Mugum Karmarong, have been emptied as locals migrate to warmer regions for nearly six months yearly.Public offices, schools, health posts, and police stations are non-operational due to the extreme cold, according to Tshering Kyapne Lama, chair of Mugum Karmarong Rural Municipality.“Development works remain suspended for six months, and most of the budget is spent hurriedly in the last months of the fiscal year,” Lama said. He said that the rural municipality has allocated Rs320 million for the current fiscal year.In the past three years, nearly Rs120 million has gone unspent, according to the municipality’s data. Although funds have been allocated for around 150 projects this year, no development expenditure has been made so far.In Humla, the Hilsa border point with China has also been closed due to snowfall. Chief District Officer Narayan Pandey said the area is covered by three feet of snow, leaving only a few people to guard and take care of the hotels, which have largely remained empty. Security personnel from Nepal Police and the Armed Police Force continue to guard the region.“Some schools in the upper regions are also closed, and the villages are deserted,” he said. “As of Saturday evening, snowfall continued, with up to one foot of snow in the areas surrounding the district headquarters.

Locals are staying indoors, keeping warm by the fire, and he noted that it would take at least a week for the situation to return to normal.While locals endure harsh indoor conditions, farmers remain optimistic about improved agricultural yields.

From 2015 to 2018, the shadowy deal to pocket multi-million dollar bribes was orchestrated. The shady process followed a long sequence: The RFP draft was prepared. It was then sent to AAR Corp to manipulate its clauses to win the bid. The document was returned to Nepal Airlines, and the RFP was issued. After that, the supply contract was signed, following which the plane supplier was changed.After the change of supplier, many shady intermediary companies were opened to distribute the bribes.The SEC made the document public on December 19. In 2015, Nepal Airlines received a nod from its board to buy two wide-body jets from Airbus, the European aviation giant, after receiving two narrow bodies of the Airbus A320 aircraft.The decision followed its management’s recommendation to switch to Airbus from Boeing as pursuing a one-family aircraft strategy would reduce maintenance and crew training costs. On September 26, 2016, the national flag carrier invited sealed requests for proposal (RFP) from aircraft manufacturing companies, airlines, aircraft leasing companies and bankers to purchase two A330-200 jets. The $209.6-million plane purchase deal was the largest in Nepal’s aviation history.In 2015, Deepak Sharma, 46, a Nepali-born British citizen, was hired as president of the International Supply Chain for an AAR subsidiary. At the time, Sharma suggested he could help secure the Nepal Airlines deal. Upon arriving at AAR, Sharma pursued the opportunity as the lead employee responsible for winning the Nepal Airlines contract, reporting directly to an AAR executive.Sharma, the president of the AAR subsidiary, had been in charge from November 2015 until his suspension in April 2019— when Kansakar orchestrated the plan.In March 2016, Sharma secured and shared internally at AAR an unpublished draft of the RFP for AAR executives to “comment on” and “change any terms to suit AAR.” As a result, Sharma and others at AAR proposed changes to the draft RFP to benefit AAR in the bidding process. According to the document, a few months later, Sharma “emailed the Nepal Airlines’ Managing Director adding specifications to the RFP, and then forwarded this email internally,” writing that the “way this RFP is going no one else will qualify to bid except AAR.” The bid documents said the minimum age of the proposed aircraft could not be more than 1,000 flight hours, and the date of manufacture should not be before January 2014. The intent was to keep the manufacturer Airbus out of the race as it could not deliver used planes and other bidders could not meet the specifications outlined in the bid document.On September 26, 2016, the RFP was officially published. Upon publication, Sharma reported in an internal email that the RFP was “designed for us.”When the final deadline ended on November 10, 2016, eleven international firms submitted bids to supply two long-range wide-body passenger jets to Nepal Airlines. The suppliers were Rolls-Royce, KL AeroParts, Aircraft Investment Group, Crown Commercial Services, Synergy Aerospace, ST Aerospace, Le Group Delta, AAR Corporation, Surya Air Support, KJT Investment & One World Closeouts and Ron Motta Associates Aircraft Sales & Parts. Rolls-Royce had applied to supply the aircraft engine.Sharma’s internal communications to AAR personnel suggested that Nepal Airlines request for proposal (“RFP”) would be drafted to favour AAR. For example, on November 22, 2015, Sharma sent an internal email conveying that he had a “good meeting” with the “CEO of [Nepal] airlines” and that the RFP for the transaction would be drafted in favour of the AAR. In a follow-up December internal email, Sharma forwarded the email correspondence between himself and Nepal Airlines’ Managing Director Kansakar, adding that the Managing Director was “100 percent relying on us to bid and win this aircraft sales” contract.Soon after the RFP was published, Sharma discussed internally the need to engage third-party Agents [a Hong Kong corporation, controlled by a German corporation and a Portuguese charter airline, and purportedly involved in the telecom business] as an agent on the Nepal Airlines transaction. In doing so, Sharma noted that he would “pull all political strings in Nepal” and that setting up a foreign representative agreement (FRA) with Hong Kong corporation would help “lock… in” the Nepal Airlines deal. The Hong Kong corporation, purportedly a telecom business, was engaged by an AAR subsidiary despite red flags raised during due diligence. AAR's due diligence flagged that the Hong Kong corporation lacked any aviation industry experience and had limited and vague descriptions of the services it would provide.Two customer references provided by the Hong Kong corporation involve sales of cell phones and electronics.As a part of the scheme, the AAR subsidiary retained the Hong Kong corporation, whose role was to bribe officials who had control over the Nepal Airlines contract. AAR terminated its relationship with the Hong Kong corporation before the transaction’s closing, resulting in Sharma arranging to have the German corporation pay the Hong Kong corporation and its successor entity—another Dubai-based entity incorporated in the UAE—a success fee for winning the Nepal Airlines contract.On November 1, 2016, the Hong Kong corporation was officially engaged under the Foreign Representative Agreement (FRA). Under the FRA, the corporation would get a commission payment of 7 percent of the final sales price of the two aircraft, and the commission payment was estimated to be between $9.6 million and $14.6 million. On November 8, 2016, the AAR subsidiary formed a consortium through a framework agreement with the German corporation and the Portuguese charter airline (collectively the “AAR Consortium”) to submit a bid on the Nepal Airlines RFP. Under the initial structure, AAR would provide the aircraft, the German corporation would offer financing, and the Portuguese charter airline would provide services, spare parts, and tooling. The German corporation would use a Special Purpose Vehicle to buy the two A330 aircraft from Airbus, and the Special Purpose Vehicle would then sell the aircraft to AAR, which in turn would sell the aircraft to Nepal Airlines. AAR estimated it would make between $8 million and $12 million from that transaction structure.On November 9, 2016, the AAR Consortium submitted its bid in response to the RFP. In the cover letter for the bid, Sharma addressed Nepal Airlines Managing Director Kansakar. The next day, Sharma texted an AAR executive, “We got the Nepal deal.”On December 1, 2016, AAR executives learned from Sharma that the money going to the German corporation would be used to “donate to Nepal's political parties” as part of the Nepal Airlines deal. On December 4, 2016, AAR received an anonymous email alleging bribery in the Nepal Airlines deal. After learning from Sharma that the German corporation would be making these payments, AAR terminated the German corporation on December 9, 2016. On January 16, 2017, Nepal Airlines notified AAR that its board had approved the AAR Consortium’s bid.On January 27, 2017, Nepal Airlines signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with AAR Corp to buy two Airbus A330-200 long-range jets. The airline then planned to pay AAR Corp a $1 million “commitment fee” within two to three days to formally confirm the order.Kansakar told the Post at that time that AAR, the American aviation support company, quoted an “offer price” of $104.8 million for each jet. “However, the ‘contract price’ may differ slightly in the purchase agreement.” When AAR terminated the German corporation on December 9, 2016, the delivery date and the supplier were abruptly changed.Subsequently, the national flag carrier told the Nepali media its fleet expansion plan would be delayed by three months.As per the revised schedule, Nepal Airlines was to receive the first aircraft by January 2018.According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission document, the initial supply plan was restructured so that the Special Purpose Vehicle would buy the two A330s from Airbus. Rather than selling them to AAR, the vehicle would sell the aircraft directly to Nepal Airlines.To negotiate the transaction, AAR would receive a $6 million commission (rather than the originally planned $9.6-14.6 million).As part of the termination of the FRA, the AAR subsidiary and the Hong Kong corporation executed a termination of the German corporation, and there was a separate fee agreement that provided the Hong Kong corporation with $250,000 as “full payment” for its time and costs associated with its efforts relating to the sale of [the] aircraft”.Sharma subsequently put in place a May 2017 agreement between the Hong Kong corporation and the German corporation under which the German corporation would pay its Hong Kong counterpart a commission of $4 million per aircraft ($8 million total).The agreement was backdated to October 7, 2016 to make it look like it was in place when the AAR Consortium placed its bid.A subsequent July 2017 agreement replaced the German corporation with the Special Purpose Vehicle, making it responsible for paying the relevant sales commission to the Hong Kong corporation.However, when the Nepal Airlines transaction closed, the terminated German corporation’s payments (through the Special Purpose Vehicle) to the Hong Kong corporation were blocked due to the “Know Your Customer” rules of the Hong Kong corporation’s bank.This resulted in Sharma working with a Nepali national to set up a new Dubai-based company to receive payments from the German corporation.The Dubai-based entity was incorporated on October 22, 2017 with one of its two shareholders being the son of a Nepali national.In 2018, AAR paid the Hong Kong corporation $250,000 in commission via a wire transfer through at least one US correspondent bank, and the German corporation and Dubai-based entity were paid $2.6 million.While the payment to the Hong Kong corporation was part of the bribery scheme and the AAR subsidiary lacked documentary evidence reflecting any legitimate services provided by the corporation, the AAR subsidiary recorded $250,000 as a legitimate commission expense.AAR failed to devise and maintain internal accounting controls related to vendor management and accounts payable sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that AAR personnel were adhering to AAR’s Global Anti-Corruption Policy and its procedures on the retention of and payments to third-party agents.In August 2024, in connection with the Nepal Airlines scam, Sharma pleaded guilty to a one-count criminal information filed in the US, charging him with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).AAR agreed to pay more than $55 million to resolve investigations by the US Justice Department and the US Securities and Exchange Commission into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits bribe payments to foreign government officials.According to the US Justice Department, AAR obtained profits of nearly $24 million as a result of the scheme.Sharma pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit around $130,000. His sentences are yet to be determined in the US court, so this case is ongoing. ","summary":"Then managing director of Nepal Airlines Sugat Ratna Kansakar had sent a draft of the request for proposal (RFP) for procuring two Airbus A330s to AAR Corp, the US-based global aerospace company, well in advance, to tweak conditions in favour of the AAR.Then, the clauses in the draft were cunningly adjusted and sent back to Nepal Airlines, according to the statement and formal document submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by AAR.Such manipulation is a criminal offence under Nepal’s public procurement law, but the criminal aspect has been overlooked throughout Nepal's investigation into the Airbus scam. From 2015 to 2018, the shadowy deal to pocket multi-million dollar bribes was orchestrated. The shady process followed a long sequence: The RFP draft was prepared. It was then sent to AAR Corp to manipulate its clauses to win the bid. The document was returned to Nepal Airlines, and the RFP was issued. After that, the supply contract was signed, following which the plane supplier was changed.After the change of supplier, many shady intermediary companies were opened to distribute the bribes.The SEC made the document public on December 19. In 2015, Nepal Airlines received a nod from its board to buy two wide-body jets from Airbus, the European aviation giant, after receiving two narrow bodies of the Airbus A320 aircraft.The decision followed its management’s recommendation to switch to Airbus from Boeing as pursuing a one-family aircraft strategy would reduce maintenance and crew training costs. On September 26, 2016, the national flag carrier invited sealed requests for proposal (RFP) from aircraft manufacturing companies, airlines, aircraft leasing companies and bankers to purchase two A330-200 jets. The $209.6-million plane purchase deal was the largest in Nepal’s aviation history.In 2015, Deepak Sharma, 46, a Nepali-born British citizen, was hired as president of the International Supply Chain for an AAR subsidiary. At the time, Sharma suggested he could help secure the Nepal Airlines deal. Upon arriving at AAR, Sharma pursued the opportunity as the lead employee responsible for winning the Nepal Airlines contract, reporting directly to an AAR executive.Sharma, the president of the AAR subsidiary, had been in charge from November 2015 until his suspension in April 2019— when Kansakar orchestrated the plan.In March 2016, Sharma secured and shared internally at AAR an unpublished draft of the RFP for AAR executives to “comment on” and “change any terms to suit AAR.” As a result, Sharma and others at AAR proposed changes to the draft RFP to benefit AAR in the bidding process.

Experts say such a jurisdiction issue may spill over to other national parks if this issue is not handled well. The federal government, however, has not taken the matter seriously.On December 12, the Sagarmatha National Park, which houses the world’s tallest peak, issued directives restricting commercial choppers from flying over it. On December 13, the civil aviation regulator responded that the park has no legal ground to enforce such a ban.After three days, on Monday, the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, the local federal unit, issued a strongly worded statement against commercial chopper operations in the Everest region.“We request the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal and all travel agencies operating within this rural municipality to refrain from booking or selling any packages that include helicopter flights for the Khumbu region,” according to the statement. “If any individual or agency engages in such activities after this notice, and if it causes any obstacles or issues in this region, the rural municipality will not be held accountable. This press release has been issued to inform all concerned parties.”The municipality added: “Beyond Lukla, only rescue and sling flights that comply with the laws and regulations of Sagarmatha National Park will be allowed. All other commercial helicopter flights will be banned entirely from January 1.”As per the rural municipality directive, a recommendation must be obtained from the health institution at the flight site for emergency rescues. A health professional must be present on the flight. If further treatment outside the region is required, patients must undergo a test at Pasanglhamu Nicole Niquille Hospital in Lukla and get a mandatory recommendation from the hospital. “Henceforth, only rescue and sling flights in compliance with the laws and regulations of Sagarmatha National Park will be permitted beyond Lukla,” the municipal statement reads.The statement comes in response to one by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, which vowed not to follow the rules imposed by the national park and asked the helicopter companies to continue with their regular flights. The immediate concern raised by the park is severe noise pollution caused by frequent helicopter flights over the area. The noise disturbs animals, which rely on the park’s relatively undisturbed natural environment. Excess noise can interfere with their feeding, breeding, and other behaviours.The national park has tasked the Nepal Army and local youth groups with monitoring the ban, a development chopper operators see as a serious security concern.“The noise generated by choppers is alarming,” said Jagat Prasad Bhusal, chief administrative officer of the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality. “Every day, it feels like the loud noise will blow your ears out.”On November 13, the rural municipality held a discussion inviting ten lawmakers from the upper house of parliament in the Khumbu region. The programme had to be abandoned due to excessive noise of choppers. “Most complaints are from schools. The noise has affected the studies of children.”Every day, the rural municipality receives hordes of complaints from locals about noise pollution. “We do not oppose flights, but the helicopter companies are adamant about not obeying rules. They land anywhere they wish,” said Bhusal. According to the rural municipality, most helicopters are yet to pay the Rs200,000 annual “business tax” imposed by the local government. The park, which covers an area of 1,148 square kilometres in the Solukhumbu district, was established on July 19, 1976. In 1979, in recognition of its superlative natural surroundings and unique culture, it was put on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list.The national park said noise pollution in the wildlife habitat has resulted in behavioural changes in animals.The sounds can cause wild animals to leave their habitats and run into the villages. The park authority said accidents involving animals like Himalayan tahr and Himalayan goral, a goat-antelope with a short tail and backwards-pointing horns, are rising. The shy natural goral is found foraging and sheltering on rocky faces of mountains.The animals jump off the cliffs in shock when choppers fly at low altitudes with big sounds. Their deaths are rising. The park authority said they had done justice to the wild animals by stopping commercial flights above the national park.Tourism ministry officials said they are aware of the issue. “We have been discussing the matter with the forest ministry,” said Ram Krishna Lamichhane, spokesperson for the tourism ministry. “We hope the issue will be sorted out soon.”The tourism fraternity warned that the Everest sightseeing ban could harm Nepal’s tourism, which is still struggling to recover to pre-Covid levels. The park is also a major tourist attraction, especially for trekking to the Everest base camp.The Everest sightseeing tour, which falls into an expensive, high-end tourism segment, is a lifelong dream of many people around the world.

In this period of inaction from the court, Samara (who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) fell into depression and attempted suicide, feeling trapped and hopeless. “There is late justice, and these victims are still being victimised,” Samara’s legal counsel told the Post. “Justice delayed is justice denied.” Women in Nepal seeking justice for domestic violence or property partition wait years—often more than five and sometimes upwards of ten years—for the court to resolve their cases and fully implement the decision. The delays in case processing come at a cost to the women, who endure more harassment, financial strain, and loss of contact with their children as they wait for the justice system to take action. In the past year, the court has established a family bench in six of the 77 district courts in Nepal to hear women’s cases more quickly. The bench aims to give female plaintiffs faster decisions in cases related to family relations, alimony, domestic violence, and property division. The family bench, however, does not see a woman’s case when it also includes a legal matter outside of the purview of the bench, nor does the court see divorce cases as Nepali law mandates a one-year waiting period for divorce cases when one of the parties does not agree to the divorce. Since its filing, the main trial court has heard Samara’s case as it is tied to a property division case in which her late husband’s relative is the plaintiff. Samara’s interim order from the court has brought her some peace. Since the order two years ago, her harasser has stopped coming to her workplace demanding the property holdings of her late husband. “After she got the interim order, she believed in herself more,” Samara’s legal counsel said. “Before, she didn’t believe in court, she thought she would not get justice.” Samara’s legal counsel anticipates that the case will take at least another two and a half years at the district court, and may continue longer at the Supreme Court level if one of the parties chooses to appeal the decision. “She doesn’t feel protected,” the legal counsel said. Even when a woman’s case goes to the family bench, procedural hurdles can still delay the verdict, particularly when the case involves property division. Edha’s (who the Post is also identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) domestic violence and property division case is in its fourth year at the Kathmandu District Court. One of her hearings was with one of the three judges appointed to preside over the family bench. She had an arranged marriage more than 20 years ago, and soon after she gave birth to her first child. “After I got married, the abuse was non-stop,” she said. “It was quite brutal.”During her marriage, her husband, who continuously had relationships with other women, left her with serious injuries in bouts of violence, and pressured her to abort multiple pregnancies, though she did later have a second child as the pregnancy was too advanced to abort. Edha didn’t tell anyone about the abuse for most of her marriage. “If you’re going through something bad, if nobody comes to know, then it’s okay,” she said. “My fear was, if people find out, what will they think?”This fear of judgment stopped Edha from taking legal action for years. “In Nepal, if your husband hits you, that means it’s your fault,” she said. “With that kind of stigma, at times, I would just blame myself.” During the pandemic, Edha’s husband told her he wanted a divorce, and became more physically abusive. She decided to leave the house and move to a different home, though she felt hesitant about having to leave her children. “When he told me to get out of the house, and when he started hitting me, I thought I cannot survive in the house,” she said. “It was really difficult for me to leave. I feared I wouldn’t be able to take care of my children.”Edha hopes she will soon have her final hearing, which has been delayed because the court required further documentation. Edha fears seeing her abuser again at the hearing. “That fear is still within me,” she said. “I don’t want to look at that man.”After years of living alone, Edha feels most devastated by the loss of time with her children. She hopes her case will result in her being able to stay where she currently lives and have parental visitation rights. “They told me, within three months, this will be over,” she said between tears. “But it’s the fourth year running, and my kids are far away. I have missed the moments with them.” Edha feels stuck, with no other option than waiting for justice. “I don’t have any faith in the justice system of Nepal—no faith at all,” she said. According to domestic violence victims and their lawyers, when a male defendant has connections to judges or enough money to offer bribes, getting justice can be near impossible. Manika Khadka is a criminal lawyer working with the Women’s Foundation Nepal, and has seen dozens of women’s cases. “In some cases, he [the defendant] is so powerful and they use unnecessary power—that’s why we cannot get justice.”Neesa (also a pseudonym) filed a property division case against her husband nearly a decade ago and shortly after a domestic violence case. Male members of her family had for years violently abused her. Her cases have faced continuous delays, she claims, because of her husband’s bribes and connections to court officials. “You can go and register your case in the court, but then if corruption is involved… court procedures can be manipulated to cause delays,” she said. The Supreme Court has already issued a verdict in Neesa’s favor on the domestic violence case, ordering the defendant to pay both interim relief and a fine. The court, however, has failed to implement the decision.According to Neesa, because of bribes from her husband, officials in the implementation division of the district court have intentionally not enforced the Supreme Court’s verdict to make the defendant pay interim relief to the victim. Instead, the implementation division gave an order that would allow the defendant to avoid payment—a direct violation of the Supreme Court’s ruling. Neesa has no choice but to go back through the court system again, asking for the Supreme Court’s decision to be enforced. Her property case is still ongoing, and each step of the process takes months, she said. “There is a delay at every step of the process,” Neesa said. “The court officials don’t do their jobs efficiently.” Neesa feels frustrated with how long her cases have taken, and the amount of time, money and energy they have required from her. “It is a nightmare,” she said. “These delays and obstacles are attempts to make the plaintiff give up—women rarely have the resources to fight these cases for years and years.” “I can’t plan my life, I’m stuck,” she said. “It’s years of my life I won’t get back.” Samara, Edha, and Neesa each are equipped with legal counsel and have current cases pending, but, as Neesa reflected, innumerable women endure abuse in silence, particularly after they see other women endure long delays in the court cases. “I am educated and can stand up for myself and this is how I am treated, imagine the women who are uneducated,” Neesa said. “If [the court procedure] was simple and it was fair a lot more women would go through it and get justice,” she said.   ","summary":"Samara endured six months of harassment from a relative of her late husband before a court interim order demanded her harasser leave her alone. In this period of inaction from the court, Samara (who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) fell into depression and attempted suicide, feeling trapped and hopeless. “There is late justice, and these victims are still being victimised,” Samara’s legal counsel told the Post. “Justice delayed is justice denied.” Women in Nepal seeking justice for domestic violence or property partition wait years—often more than five and sometimes upwards of ten years—for the court to resolve their cases and fully implement the decision. The delays in case processing come at a cost to the women, who endure more harassment, financial strain, and loss of contact with their children as they wait for the justice system to take action. In the past year, the court has established a family bench in six of the 77 district courts in Nepal to hear women’s cases more quickly. The bench aims to give female plaintiffs faster decisions in cases related to family relations, alimony, domestic violence, and property division. The family bench, however, does not see a woman’s case when it also includes a legal matter outside of the purview of the bench, nor does the court see divorce cases as Nepali law mandates a one-year waiting period for divorce cases when one of the parties does not agree to the divorce. Since its filing, the main trial court has heard Samara’s case as it is tied to a property division case in which her late husband’s relative is the plaintiff. Samara’s interim order from the court has brought her some peace. Since the order two years ago, her harasser has stopped coming to her workplace demanding the property holdings of her late husband. “After she got the interim order, she believed in herself more,” Samara’s legal counsel said. “Before, she didn’t believe in court, she thought she would not get justice.” Samara’s legal counsel anticipates that the case will take at least another two and a half years at the district court, and may continue longer at the Supreme Court level if one of the parties chooses to appeal the decision. “She doesn’t feel protected,” the legal counsel said. Even when a woman’s case goes to the family bench, procedural hurdles can still delay the verdict, particularly when the case involves property division. Edha’s (who the Post is also identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) domestic violence and property division case is in its fourth year at the Kathmandu District Court.

Now I have started meeting top leaders of the Madhesh-based political parties,” Tripathi told the Post. His team has urged the leaders to create a “loose alliance” at first and to transform it later into a united front for the “larger cause of the Madhesh and the Madheshi people”.Tripathi has formed a three-member task force to hold talks with leaders from various Madhesh-based political parties and he himself is holding talks with the top brass.“Most of those who I or our friends have spoken to are positive towards forming such an alliance at the beginning,” Tripathi said. “As the country is confronting several problems and crises, the time has come for us to unite and work together.”After the second people’s movement in 2006, politics in Madhesh got a new lease of life with the rise of regional political forces. New political parties and fronts were formed, raising several issues related to the Madheshi people and their under-representation in state organs.Some of the prominent Madhesh-based parties got unified and emerged as decisive forces in national politics. But they could not sustain their unity.Within a couple of years, the Madhesh-based parties split into several parties. They, however, remained united on their agendas until the promulgation of the new constitution in 2015.Stating that the major political parties didn’t address some of their important demands while writing the new constitution, they led a strong agitation dubbed Madhesh uprising, and they even protested on the Nepal-India border blocking the movement of goods from India.Dozens of people were killed during the uprising but their agendas remained unsettled and the country went into the local, provincial and federal elections.The Madhesh-based political parties from the southern belt of the country with a huge vote share in the national politics could not retain power due to divisions among them.Tripathi hopes that they will now “learn from the past and aim to revive the old glory of Madheshi parties and address the country’s crises”. Tripathi hopes this mission can bring them together and will make them agree on some crucial issues.So far, he has met Upendra Yadav, chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal); CK Raut, chairman of the Janamat Party; Ashok Rai, chairman of Janata Samajbadi Party; Resham Chaudhary, chairman of the Nagarik Unmukti Party; and Prabhu Sah, chair of Aam Janata Party. Some of the task force members have met with Mahantha Thakur, too. Tripathi also plans to meet Rajendra Mahato, who recently formed a new party, Rastriya Mukti Kranti Nepal.“I have found that no one is against this proposal,” Tripathi said. “Once forming the loose alliance, we will agree on some common agendas and will collaborate on those in the future. But that does not mean that we will come together to form a new party immediately.”After talking with all top leaders of the Madhesh-based parties, the Tripathi-led team now plans to hold a joint meeting with them. The meeting will discuss the possible agenda and the issues in which they can work together.This initiative, however, hasn’t made everyone optimistic.“Madheshi parties are divided horizontally and vertically and have split into so many parties, groups and factions,” a senior leader of a Madhesh-based party told the Post. “There are very few chances that they will come together.”Though Tripathi has started a new campaign, some experts and observers doubt all Madhesh based parties will come together.“The ground in Madhesh is not the same as it was ten years ago,” said Dipendra Jha, a longtime observer of Madheshi politics and former chief attorney of Madhesh Province. “The situation is unpredictable as new youths are emerging and the ground is fast shifting.”Unlike Yadav’s JSP-Nepal, no party holds a stronghold in the Madhesh, said Jha.Another Madheshi leader, however, said that small parties led by Tripathi, Raut, Chaudhary, Sah and the Rastriya Mukti Kranti Nepal are likely to come together, if not those led by Upendra Yadav and Mahatha Thakur.Tripathi plans to hold a joint meeting of chiefs of all the big and small Madhesh-based parties within a week.A leader said the initiative will at least bring them together and engage them in some brainstorming.The senior leader pointed out a slew of reasons why unity among Madhesh-based parties is easier said than done.“Due to a lack of common ideology and principles, tendency of not accepting each other’s existence, personality clashes, vendettas, local dynamics and possible power-sharing deals, the parties might find it hard to come together,” the leader said.

According to Ghimire, Congress believes that political party’s unions should not be allowed to function in the bureaucracy.He was speaking on the bill to regulate the formation, operation, and conditions of federal civil service at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee meeting on Thursday.Ghimire said those on the government payroll should not participate in trade union's activities.“In civil service, trade unions shouldn't be formed based on their party allegiance,” Ghimire said. “If a trade union is needed, there could be an official one where every civil servant can be a member.”The restoration of multi-party democracy in Nepal in 1990 opened the space for civil society organisations, including trade unions. The registration of trade unions started in 1993.Devraj Dahal, a researcher who has extensively studied the necessity of establishing trade unions in Nepal, says that at that time, labourers around Nepal were getting the short end of the stick, which is one reason why trade unions were established in Nepal. Trade unions, or labour unions, are formed to advocate the rights of labourers and improve their working conditions.“Trade unions are needed to create a just society, but in Nepal, those unions have been working as proxy agencies of political parties, to advance their vested interests,” Dahal said. “Hence, their relevance can be questioned.”Dahal added that trade unions are concentrated in Kathmandu and they have failed to work in the interest of labourers outside cities who might be in most need of their advocacy.Congress lawmaker Ghimire told the Post that when every party has its trade union in the civil service or any other institutional organisations, they may support respective party’s sister wings but will not benefit the larger society.“It is high time that the country dissolved trade unions affiliated to political parties and marched ahead for the development of the country,” Ghimire said.Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) whip Bina Lama shared a more radical view at the same meeting. She said that trade unions should be completely abolished in the civil service to help bureaucracy function effectively.“Trade unions have become parties’ recruitment centres in the bureaucracy,” Lama said. “To prevent it from being expanded further, the law should prevent civil servants from joining political parties or their sister organisations.”However, Dahal differed. “Nepal is a signatory to many international treaties, which oblige us to do so. Therefore, the country cannot fully eradicate trade unions,” he said. Instead of making it a recruitment centre for political parties, as the Congress chief whip Ghimire said, Dahal advocates an umbrella trade union where all can be adjusted.“In most Western countries, including Germany, there is one official trade union that works efficiently,” Dahal added.The draft of the Federal Civil Service Act, sent by the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration for discussion in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the Parliament, also proposes approval of one official trade union for government employees at the federal and provincial levels.While speaking on the bill in the same meeting, Mahesh Bartaula, the chief whip of ruling party CPN-UML, stood in favour of fixing the term of reservation quota for a single person in the civil service. It means a single person should be allowed to get a government position under reservation quota for a single opportunity and then the person should compete under open category for other positions.“How long will we give the facility of reservation repeatedly for a single person? It is wrong to provide reservation to the same person in every post within the service,” Bartaula further said. “Reservation should be allowed for a person only once and it should be on the basis of class.”Bartaula also advocated for the two year cooling period for government officials while joining national and international organisations after their retirement.

An eight-member task force formed to strengthen the relations between the two parties met on Tuesday and discussed initiating the amendment process. “The issue of amendment has finally entered our discussion from today [Tuesday],” a task force member said. “We are currently discussing how to proceed and start wider discussions and consultations. We are considering forming either a political or a non-political taskforce to do the required homework.”The cross-party task force will be led by a senior politician, and comprise members of different political parties. If a non-political task force is formed, it will be led by a former chief justice of the Supreme Court or any other respected legal figure acceptable to all stakeholders. Some Congress and UML leaders have suggested forming a non-political mechanism or taskforce where legal experts, constitutional experts, human rights activists among others can be accommodated and a way ahead can be found as per their suggestions, according to a taskforce member. “We will confront difficult questions if we form a political mechanism,” he said. The meeting lasted three hours and leaders also discussed some ‘neutral’ names who can potentially lead such a mechanism or taskforce. Some political parties in the opposition have already started discussion and deliberations on the issues that need to to be addressed in order to amend the constitution. Point number two of the seven-point agreement signed between the Congress and UML in July stated that the national consensus government under the leadership of Oli would give priority to making necessary amendments to the constitution and formulating laws that ensure political stability by evaluating the strengths and weaknesses as well as the complexities seen in its implementation. “As per the understanding, our party will soon form a mechanism to identify the content for amendment,” said Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak.The Nepali Congress and the UML will soon form separate task forces to identify the contents for amendment in the constitution, Lekhak said at an event in Kathmandu. “The government has also taken an initiative on this.”“The amendment process does not end overnight.

We will assess our decade-long experience of constitutional practice and, accordingly, all political parties will sit together and make amendments,” he said.“We will initiate discussions, evaluate and assess the status of the implementation of the constitution, identify the amendment subject matters, and proceed with discussions and deliberations,” said Lekhak.The agreement between the two largest parties to amend the constitution has ignited debate in and outside political circles. Parties are divided on whether this is the right time to make changes in the constitution. But Home Minister Lekhak said the ruling and opposition parties will first review the 10-year journey of the constitution and identify its strengths and weaknesses. Second, the two ruling parties will identify the issues that need to be amended and the ruling and opposition parties will sit together for this. At last, the Congress and UML will reach an agreement on the content for amendment and table it in the house. He also clarified that the amendment to the constitution will strengthen inclusiveness rather than weaken it. The third largest party, the CPN (Maoist Centre), will also soon publicise its position on constitution amendment. The upcoming central committee meeting of the party scheduled to kick off on January 5 will open discussions on the matter, said party spokesperson Agni Prasad Sapkota. “The party has its own position on the amendment but we are open to discussions,” Sapkota said. The party will make its position public only after the meeting of its central committee.“Our position is clear: any amendment to the constitution should be for a progressive cause, not for a regressive cause.

After two days, on Monday night, 23-year-old Nayan Gurung was murdered at the Town Cafe in Chyasal, Lalitpur.According to initial police investigation reports, no definite reason for the two murders has been found other than a momentary impulse on the part of the assailant.After a failed suicide bid, Acharya surrendered himself, Nepal Police spokesperson Bishwa Adhikari said. There is a mark from attempted suicide on his body, and police are investigating the matter.The bodies of 56-year-old Kul Prasad and his 22-year-old son Prabin were found in separate rooms of their residence in ward 2 of Suryabinayak Municipality, Fika Dhara.“After breaking into the house on Monday morning, we found the father and younger son dead in separate rooms,” said Deputy Superintendent Dhundiraj Neupane, spokesperson for the Bhaktapur District Police Range. “As per our initial investigation, the murders were committed on Saturday night. However, it came to our notice on Monday morning after one of their neighbours informed us that the doors to the rooms had been locked for the past two days.”The younger son’s body was found on a bed in a makeshift kitchen, while the father’s body was in another room. Both had injuries below their ears. Police recovered a traditional stone grinder and a dumbbell with blood and hair at the scene.The Acharya brothers had been renting a ground-floor room in the three-storey house for three years.The Acharya family is from Diktel Rupakot Majhuwagadhi Municipality in Khotang district. The deceased, Kul Prasad, was the acting head of the Khotang District Post Office while younger son Prabin was pursuing a BSc degree.Nepal Police has also arrested three people on charges of murder of Nayan Gurung and have taken them under investigation.According to District Police Range Lalitpur spokesperson Navratna Paudel Gurung, who had visited the Town Cafe in Chyasal on Monday night, was involved in a fatal brawl with the cafe staff in the course of paying the bill.“Gurung was stabbed to death,” spokesperson Paudel said. Those arrested are Hemraj Bhatta, 26, who works at the restaurant; Janak Bahadur Tamang, 22, of Kavre; and Padmalal Bhatta, 41, of Darchula.Milan Acharya, who had absconded following the Fika Dhara incident, turned himself in at the Maharajgunj Police Circle on Tuesday morning to confess to the murder of his father and brother. According to Bishwa Adhikari, spokesperson for Nepal Police, Acharya has confessed to killing his father and younger brother. Adhikari says that Acharya cited depression as the reason for the murder.“My father had depression, I failed to pass the civil service exams despite multiple attempts, and my younger brother was not good at studying, which had further exacerbated the family’s frustrations,” Adhikari quoted Acharya as saying. “I decided to relieve my family by killing them and later killing myself.” Psychiatrist Dr Basudev Karki, who has been actively involved in establishing the field of Community Psychiatry in Nepal, says that in most such cases the murderers as well as those who commit serious crimes have poor mental health. “The parents, the surrounding environment, the whole society, affects an individual’s upbringing. If they are not brought up right, there is a high chance of them committing various kinds of crimes after they grow up,” said Karki.Of late, there has been a spate of murders. As per initial investigation by Nepal Police, most murder cases result from personal enmity. Talking to the media on December 18, Nepal Police spokesperson Adhikari said: “The increasing cases of murders are due to personal grievances rather than criminal motives.”As per the police data, in the first four months of the fiscal year 2024-25, at least 192 people have been murdered.Anthropologist Dambar Chemjong says that individuals see themselves as alienated from society when they fail to cope with the rapidly changing social, political, economic and technological changes, which leads to depression, suicidal tendencies and criminal activities.“When social beliefs, norms and values are diluted due to rapid changes in society, people can breach the norms of human life on a momentary impulse,” Chemjong added. “I see the same tendency in Acharya’s case.” ","summary":"Between Saturday and Monday night, four murders occurred in Kathmandu Valley, with the motives ranging from depression to brawls."},{"hash":"591303e4265205859014fed6c2937bf1451a1e8d97572a95a954b68ac5acec4d","title":"balkot-double-murder-suspect-surrenders-to-police","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/bhaktapur/2024/12/24/balkot-double-murder-suspect-surrenders-to-police","date":1734998400000,"source":"kp","category":"bhaktapur","content":"Milan Acharya, who had been absconding following the Balkot incident, turned himself in at the Maharajgunj Police Circle on Tuesday morning.According to police sources, Acharya has confessed to killing his father and younger brother.The bodies of 56-year-old Kul Prasad Acharya and his 22-year-old son Prabin Acharya were discovered on Monday in separate rooms of their residence in ward 2 of Suryabinayak Municipality, Balkot.“We found the father and younger son dead after breaking into the house on Monday morning.

So far, three clades of mpox viruses—clade I, clade IIa and cladeIIb—have been identified.Officials say clade identification tells the virus’s virulence and transmissibility of the virus, which is necessary to curb the further spread of deadly disease. As the country lacks a system to carry out virus sub-typing, it sought help from the UN health body. “We will probably send the specimen taken directly from the rash—skin fluid or crusts collected from the infected person—to the World Health Organisation’s collaborating centre in Thailand for clade identification,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Identification of the virus’ clade will help us to figure out what extra measures are needed to mitigate the risks of further spread.”Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with the mpox virus. Last week, Nepal confirmed its second mpox case. A 36-year-old man from Tanahun, who returned from Saudi Arabia on December 19, tested positive for the disease. The country confirmed its first case of mpox infection in June last year when a 60-year-old foreign national tested positive.Experts say clade I, which is present in the Congo basin, causes up to 10 percent human mortality and is transmitted by rodents, although human-to-human transmission has also been recorded. Clade IIa, which exists in West Africa, has a low mortality rate, but clade IIb is currently spreading globally through human transmission. Clade IIb was responsible for infection in the first mpox case in Nepal.According to Ojha, the health condition of the infected person is normal, and he could be discharged from the hospital in a few days.With the confirmation of the second mpox case in Nepal, health authorities have stepped up surveillance measures to prevent a possible outbreak of the deadly viral disease.Along with stepping up screening of passengers entering the country via the Tribhuvan International Airport, health authorities have requested dermatologists throughout the country to refer suspected cases for testing.“We have also deployed health workers at the health desk at Pokhara International Airport and screened passengers who arrived from China for the dragon boat festival,” said Ojha. “We also conducted an orientation for health workers serving in strategic locations.”Public health experts in Nepal say that screening suspects at health desks at international airports and land crossings is not sufficient to prevent outbreaks, as the first symptoms of mpox can take between five and 21 days for the first symptoms of mpox to appear, and not all cases can be detected at health desks.Monkeypox cases have been reported in neighbouring India, with which Nepal shares a long, porous border. India has recorded at least 30 mpox infections since 2022.Health experts say that even though mpox is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the risks should not be underestimated. They stress the importance of precautions, saying that any disease seen in any corner of the world can reach Nepal due to the high mobility of people.Mpox has been a neglected public health problem in parts of Africa for decades. The disease came to widespread attention after May 2022, when countries outside Africa began reporting new cases.Since then, mpox has spread globally. More than 100,000 people from 122 countries have already tested positive for the disease.Its symptoms include fever, headache, swelling, body aches, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to prevent transmission.

The number could be even higher, as not all the children of the age group have been screened.“The number of the diagnosed cases were reported by the health facilities, where ailing children were taken for treatment or reported by female community health volunteers,” said Angad Bahadur Shahi, chief of the Health Office, Banke. “A separate screening programme has been started, which will tell the exact scenario.”Malnutrition is considered a silent health crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five, which fell from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.However, the progress is not the same in all provinces. More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province [Banke district is part of Lumbini Province] suffer from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Child health experts say a sharp rise in moderately and severely acute malnutrition cases in Banke is alarming, which could hinder attempts to reduce malnutrition and overall hunger problems. The increase in the problems will also hinder the attempts to achieve the United Nations-backed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has set targets to meet those goals.The country needs to reduce stunting to 15 percent from the existing 25 percent by 2030 to meet the SDGs targets, wasting to 4 percent from the current eight percent and underweight to 10 percent from the existing 19 percent.Wasting or underweight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.“Severe acute malnutrition is a medical emergency, and such children need immediate hospital admission and treatment,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, a child health expert who is also the former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Detection of moderately acute malnutrition means the problems have started recently.” He said these indicators show that efforts to rein in existing malnutrition problems and end them permanently are insufficient.Malnutrition plays a major role in the under-five mortality rate. The problem also hinders children’s mental development and eventually affects the country’s economic health by weakening intellectual capacity, reducing productivity in adulthood, and increasing vulnerability to diseases, according to experts.Health authorities have taken various measures to address malnutrition problems, including distributing ready-to-use food and running nutrition rehab homes in 24 federal and provincial hospitals. Severely acute malnourished children get admitted and treated in those centres. Experts stressed addressing moderately acute malnutrition problems, which are likely to become severe if not treated timely.“Many people consider malnutrition only a health problem, but it is a multisectoral problem, which needs a multisectoral approach to deal with,” said Upreti. “Treating severely malnourished children does not stop the problems. We need to address the poverty of their families.”Experts said non-health interventions—awareness drives, improved financial conditions of people, their education levels, and sanitation conditions—could go a long way in improving health indicators, including nutrition status.“We have made a multisectoral nutrition plan to address the existing malnutrition problems,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Sincere efforts of all concerned stakeholders can address the existing problems.”Malnutrition affects the physical as well as mental growth of children, which ultimately affects the country’s economic health, according to experts.

The World Health Organisation, however, recommends iodine concentration at 15 to 40 ppm per kg. Only 40 ppm of iodine per kilogramme of salt is fortified for India, as it is assumed that the Indian population does not need as much iodine as the Nepali people, since they also get iodine content from foods produced near the ocean.Health experts in Nepal have blamed the excessive amounts of iodine content in salt for the rise in non-communicable diseases, including hypothyroidism.Several studies—including the 2016 Nepal National Micronutrient Status Survey jointly carried out by the World Health Organisation, UNICEF, the US-based Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Ministry of Health and Population—found that Nepalis consume excessive amounts of iodine, which has resulted in high prevalence of hyperthyroidism, a condition when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones.The survey showed that more than two-thirds—68 percent—of the population across the country is consuming iodine far in excess of the recommended levels.According to the Non-communicable Disease Risk Factors: Steps Survey-2019, 5.6 percent of the adults (6.5 percent of women and 4.6 percent of men) reported adding salt often or always to food right before or while eating.Additionally, 19.5 percent of the adults (18.1 percent of the women and 21.1 percent of men) reported consuming processed foods that are often or always high in salt.Doctors in Nepal suspect that the high iodine content in the salt being sold in Nepal could be among the reasons for the high prevalence of several non-communicable diseases, including thyroid disorders and hypertension.A change in dietary patterns and an increased consumption of processed foods (including packaged soups) have resulted in an increased prevalence of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, they added.Earlier, the government had sent a team of experts to salt factories in India’s Gujarat state to study the iodine fortification process and the possibility of lowering the iodine content in salt. The expert team furnished its report, but the concerned authorities could not decide on the reduction of iodine level in salt.“We have decided to wait further until the report of the planned survey comes,” said Thapa. “The report will help us analyse what changes have happened in the last 10 years and make appropriate decisions.”In 1993, Nepal mandated that salt be fortified with iodine to prevent health problems caused by iodine deficiency, as salt is both cheap and used round the year.Officials said the higher iodine level was mandated for Nepal under the assumption that transport and storage times were longer at the time as the salt had to be carried on the backs of men and animals and some amount of iodine would dissipate by the time the salt reached markets, mainly in the remote parts of the country.However, with roads reaching almost all corners of the country, transportation time has significantly decreased, so there is no need for such a high level of iodine in salt, say doctors.The World Health Organisation recommends less than two grams of sodium or five grams of salt per day for adults to reduce blood pressure, and cut the risks of cardiovascular diseases and stroke.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration.

","summary":"I can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes.

Out of nowhere, I messaged my friend Santona on a whim: ‘A trip to Rara’. With little hope, I awaited her reply, and I have no idea what I’d have done if she had denied it. However, just like the phrase “waiting for the nudge,” she enthusiastically agreed, and soon we roped in our friend, Nirjara.This wasn’t our first trip together—we’d ventured to Pokhara, tried bungee jumping, paragliding, and trekked trails like Khuma and Korchan since our first year of bachelor studies. My idea this time was a well-packaged tour, but plans changed, and new destinations were chosen. The pristine Tilicho Lake became our goal. Without overthinking, I agreed; after all, it’s Nepal and here, no matter where you decide to trek, you’ll experience heaven.From Kathmandu to Manang: Green Lake and apple delightsTravelling to Manang was a meditative experience in itself. As a scout exploring different parts of Nepal, I had often embraced the rush of adventure. But here, by the serene Green Lake under the sun's warm glow, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment: ‘We’ve finally made it—without getting lost and in the right place.’ We clicked photos, laughed, and even made some silly TikTok videos. The famous apple farms of Manang called out to us with their irresistible offer: a feast of apples for just Rs200. If you’re travelling here, catching the early bus ensures Manang’s charm unfolds entirely by the end of the day.Khangsar to Tilicho Base Camp: rocks and rantsAn early morning jeep ride brought us to Khangsar. The trek was said to take 5-6 hours, but once we started, I moved ahead of my friends, a habit I don’t quite understand. I wondered if my friends would make it before dark. To my relief, their laughter and chatter soon filled the air, joining me.Then we set off into the landslide area, with jagged rocks above hanging like wind chimes ready to fall. We promised not to look up and remained focused on the trail. The journey was filled with everyday conversations from patriarchy to childhood TV shows, and before we knew it, the night wrapped around us as we arrived at the base camp. After some confusion over our booking, we finally settled in, ate quickly, and fell asleep. One tip: keep an eye on your things at Shrikharka—I lost my trekking poles there.Tilicho Lake: A view, a void, and acceptance Morning arrived. We emptied our room and set out, uncertain if we’d return in time and head straight to Shrikharka or stay the night again at base camp. One friend battled altitude sickness but pushed on fiercely, even bargaining for a horse ride, only to find me eventually outpacing it.As I neared the lake, the solitude and distance overwhelmed me. I called my father, who offered only a few comforting words before the line dropped. Thankfully, friends from home Nuya and Shri reached out, and I poured my thoughts to them through tears. With renewed spirit, I moved forward and finally reached a quiet pond that tricked me into thinking I’d arrived. Only after some guidance did I stand before the actual Tilicho Lake.Strangely, I felt no rush of joy. The sight was majestic, yet my reaction fell flat. I asked myself if it was okay to feel so indifferent. However, I accepted that sometimes it’s okay to feel nothing at all. A simple “I don’t know” was all the answers I needed.We had no rooms left on our last night at base camp, so we slept in a dorm, which was a cheaper and warmer option. After dinner, my friends drifted off, but I lingered by the fire, unwilling to leave its comfort. The dining hall was full of trekkers glued to their seats even after finishing their food until a friendly trek guide offered us seats. These guides, cheerful and chatty, shared fun stories and gossip.Ultimately, I want to say to all who recently went trekking, whether funded by parents or your hard-earned savings, to be proud and grateful for the opportunity to explore. And for those who couldn’t go this time, trust that your moment will come. Keep moving forward with hope, knowing that one day, your adventure awaits.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary.

Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” ","summary":"Chaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka.

She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. ","summary":"In 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

They come in various sizes and shapes and work on multiple fronts: Doing research and providing various types of research training. They run labs and libraries and organise conferences, seminars and workshops. Their works also include publishing reports, bibliographies, newsletters, journals, research and policy briefs, and books of various types.The research these organisations conduct also varies in type. Some engage in basic research in the sciences or social sciences, while others focus on policy research and interventions. Some do commissioned research (also known as consultancies). Others respond to public calls for bids but do not do commissioned research. Still others design their own research projects and then search for funding to carry them out. Since sources of funding available for such entities are rather scarce within the country, such funds, when these organisations are successful, are often sourced from international foundations and donor agencies. Academic NGOs are important to Nepal’s higher education and research landscape. They will continue to remain so in the foreseeable future.Regulatory rigmaroleGiven that Nepal’s laws do not differentiate between academic NGOs and other service-providing NGOs, the former have to comply with the same set of regulations that have been put in place for civil society organisations that mostly deliver bikas in the form of tangible materials and services. All NGOs have to renew their registration annually at the Chief District Office in the district where they are registered. If they access non-Nepali sources of funds, they also have to register at the Social Welfare Council (SWC) and get prior approval for each funded project by filling out elaborate applications. SWC is a legacy of how the Panchayat regime governed a small number of civil society organisations prior to 1990. In recent years, its approval process has involved getting prior permission from the local governments (mostly metropolitan offices) of the areas where the project will be implemented before the application is even registered at the SWC. All this involves many weeks of administrative work that frankly detracts from the main knowledge production and distribution work of the academic NGOs. Over the years, many of us have tried to point out the absurdities of such regulations. To give you one example, if a research project involves surveys in 30 local government areas, the concerned academic NGO is expected to get approval from all such entities. There cannot be a good justification for such an approval regime if we are really committed to the ideal of freedom of thought and expression enshrined in the country’s constitution. To give a second example, until recently, the guidelines of SWC used to suggest that project budgets should be spent mostly on “hardware” (also known as tangible bikas items) and not “software” (namely, salary for researchers). In a typical research project, the heaviest expense would be the remuneration for researchers and their associates. In other words, research happens by investing on the “software”. Thankfully, this absurd rule has been relaxed for research projects. Multiple-constituency accountabilityThe right to set the research agenda is synonymous with the fundamental right to freedom of thought and expression in any loktantrik polity. Work by academic NGOs is built upon two constitutionally guaranteed fundamental freedoms: The right to freedom of thought and expression and the right to organise. Organising research through academic NGOs is just a joint execution of these two rights as mentioned in our constitution.Does that mean academic NGOs should not be accountable to anybody? Sure they do. Knowledge production is a service just like the construction of health clinics or school buildings. However, there is a major difference. Since much of what happens during knowledge production and distribution cannot be shown in a tangible way, it is much harder to publicly show the results of this particular service. In this context, as I pointed out in a 2011 article published in the journal Dhaulagiri Journal of Sociology and Anthropology (volume 5), thinking about the accountability of academic NGOs in terms of multiple constituencies is useful.First, academic NGOs are accountable to their members, their funders and the Government of Nepal for the money they receive for any specific research project or general institutional support. This is accountability in monetary terms and the hisab has to be accurate. However, the money approval regime has to be made much more flexible. The requirement to get prior approval for each project from local governments and, in the case of foreign funding, from the SWC, should be removed. Other laws governing the transfer of money from outside of Nepal should be adequate to cover the transactions involving foreign funds. These NGOs can be required to make their annual audited reports (passed by their general bodies) public. They can also be required to submit a copy of such reports to the registering entity of the Government of Nepal each year but the need for their annual renewal should be done away with. Second, academic NGOs are chiefly accountable to their peers in similar organisations, other types of research centres and universities for the quality and integrity of their research. These peers are the ones who are most qualified to evaluate if the research output of these organisations is intellectually sound and methodologically competent and adds to our general repository of knowledge. Traditions of research and scholarship have been built around this notion of peer accountability inside and outside universities for a long time, and they should also apply to academic NGOs. This means the sham of government bureaucrats and their consultants doing mid-term and full-term evaluations of research projects and their outputs should be stopped. Finally, academic NGOs are also responsible to the general public and its unelected representatives (e.g., journalists) for all aspects of the research operation, including ethical considerations even when there are no formally established protocols for the same. This means they should be open to and encourage all forms of public scrutiny as is appropriate for all public institutions in a loktantrik polity. As I emphasised in my 2011 article, being accountable to these various constituencies is essential if academic NGOs want to be seen as credible players in the academic landscape, both nationally and internationally. Credibility is not earned simply by highlighting the legality of academic NGOs as civil society associations. It can only be earned with a track record established through a consistent commitment to the process of knowledge production and the quality of the end products—books, journals, policy papers and the like—and through the following of the accountability regimes described here.    ","summary":"Nepal’s research landscape includes a variety of non-governmental organisations that I like to call academic NGOs.

This past Saturday, a 5.2-magnitude quake that shook the district inflicted huge damage in Jagannath Rural Municipality. According to official data, 108 houses were destroyed while 460 saw minor damages. In addition, public infrastructure such as 24 schools, 11 health posts, and all six ward offices in the rural municipality were hit. Thankfully, no human casualties were reported.However, the fact that 50 families in the severely affected Darji settlement are now living under tarpaulins is concerning. The authorities are still collecting data on the damage in order to distribute additional relief materials. Unfortunately, in the wake of earthquakes, people also die due to delays in distributing housing aid. Conditions worsen in the biting winter cold, as tents do not provide people with enough warmth. Lest we forget, when a 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck the Jajarkot district last year, almost 35 earthquake-displaced individuals succumbed to the cold. People are also vulnerable in such temporary shelters, as there are concerns over security and sanitation. These places also become hotspots for communicable diseases.Even though the state’s post-quake recovery programmes have been somewhat satisfactory in the country, long-term solutions to mitigate the severity of this natural occurrence are still lacking, as are provisions to ensure the bare minimum in temporary shelters. Due to frequent jolts, most houses in earthquake-affected areas of the province—Jajarkot, Rukum West, Rukum East, Salyan, Rolpa, Nawalparasi East, Dailekh, Baitadi, Jumla, Kalikot and Pyuthan districts—are either fully damaged or at high risk. In many cases, the disaster victims go back to damaged houses as temporary huts cannot protect them. Yet, budgetary provisions for the construction of permanent ones are inadequate. According to the Temporary Housing Construction Grant Procedures for Earthquake-2023, the federal government provides only Rs50,000 in two tranches to each house that is completely or partially damaged—an insufficient amount to rebuild safe, earthquake-resistant homes.

It is high time our authorities at all levels became alert, expedited furnishing works on old homes and enforced strict building codes. It is also vital to prepare for disasters beforehand, examine whether houses are inhabitable, and spread awareness on the importance of earthquake-resilient houses. Apart from these long-term solutions, officials must give up their wait-and-see approach to disaster management and help quake victims in Bajura in building permanent homes with adequate budgets and resources. Clean water, nutritious food, sanitation facilities and sufficient warm clothes should be ensured while victims are in tents. Deployment of health teams to assess and address potential disease outbreaks in temporary camps is crucial too. No more lives should be lost because of very preventable post-disaster mismanagement. ","summary":"The frequency of earthquakes in Nepal’s Sudurpaschim province has significantly increased, with the Bajura district alone recording 16 tremors since October 2022. This past Saturday, a 5.2-magnitude quake that shook the district inflicted huge damage in Jagannath Rural Municipality. According to official data, 108 houses were destroyed while 460 saw minor damages. In addition, public infrastructure such as 24 schools, 11 health posts, and all six ward offices in the rural municipality were hit. Thankfully, no human casualties were reported.However, the fact that 50 families in the severely affected Darji settlement are now living under tarpaulins is concerning. The authorities are still collecting data on the damage in order to distribute additional relief materials. Unfortunately, in the wake of earthquakes, people also die due to delays in distributing housing aid. Conditions worsen in the biting winter cold, as tents do not provide people with enough warmth. Lest we forget, when a 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck the Jajarkot district last year, almost 35 earthquake-displaced individuals succumbed to the cold. People are also vulnerable in such temporary shelters, as there are concerns over security and sanitation. These places also become hotspots for communicable diseases.Even though the state’s post-quake recovery programmes have been somewhat satisfactory in the country, long-term solutions to mitigate the severity of this natural occurrence are still lacking, as are provisions to ensure the bare minimum in temporary shelters.

The cost of milk and milk products has spiked so much that many households have cut down on (or entirely stopped) their consumption. The price of processed milk, which was Rs76 a litre in January 2022, has climbed up to Rs120 a litre. Dairy products from Uttar Pradesh of India that are comparatively cheaper (INR62 or Rs100 a litre) are also smuggled into the country. As a result of reduced demand and steady imports of cheap products, the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation now has a stockpile of 600 tonnes of butter and 500 tonnes of powdered milk, and the farmers are yet to get Rs580 million the cash-strapped DDC owes them. Farmers, dismayed by the delays in payment, have often had to take to the streets.In an effort to settle the problem, the DDC has started exploring domestic private as well as international markets. To start with, it has agreed to supply 1,000 kg of raw cheese or whey (used to make chhurpi which is also called hard cheese) to a private company daily, starting December 30. The DDC will need 10,000 litres of milk a day to do so. The company, Himalayan Dog Chew, owned by the Manaram Group, exports chhurpi to the United States. Known as dog chew in the West, chhurpi is quite popular and in high demand among the owners of pooches in the US and Canada. But exporters in Nepal have struggled to meet the demand. So the deal between the private company and the DDC couldn’t have come at a better time. The dairy corporation has, for the first time, collaborated with the private sector to sell its products. But there’s still a lot of work to be done. As reported in Kantipur, the Post’s sister publication, eastern Nepal has a huge potential to export hard cheese, and some small dairy firms and farmers, with their own efforts, are selling these products in India without branding them. If Nepal could brand them and strike multiple such partnerships with more private companies in the countries in its immediate neighborhood, it could be to the benefit of both the DDC and the dairy farmers. Exporting milk products with the help of the private sector could bring relief to the farmers and the broader dairy industry. However, the success of this initiative is contingent on strong coordination between private companies and farmers. To facilitate this, the dairy corporation should establish a clear mechanism to get the milk from the farmers, who are at the start of the supply chain, to the exporters, who are at the end. There should also be a lot more coordination. For instance, while the demand for chhurpi is healthy, the butter that emerges during dog chew production doesn’t get the market. As the DDC is also planning to export butter to Tibet and to the larger Chinese markets, establishing a seamless channel of trade and communication between the farmers, the DDC and the private buyers would be vital. If China agrees to Nepal’s export proposal, experts say that the DDC’s products will not stockpile.

The party, which has 10 seats in the federal lower house is struggling with organisation building, re-elected Nepal as party chief in July. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Chairman Nepal to hear his assessment of the new party’s three years and his future plans for it.How do you review the first three years of your party?First, we have to start with the question of if the formation of this party was necessary. We made the absolutely right move by revolting [against the CPN-UML leadership’s actions]. We foiled the attempts to trample on the constitution and stopped the autocratic, regressive, rightist and individualistic tendencies from prevailing in Nepali politics. Our moves have been politically, legally as well as constitutionally justified, with even the Supreme Court validating them. After that, we displaced the then [KP Sharma Oli-led] government, and brought national politics on the right track. We then formed this party. Politics doesn’t always go in a straight line. In politics, you face ups and downs, twists and turns and sometimes turbulence. Those who are powerful today could become weak and may disappear over time. Weaker forces may get stronger. Some of our friends say, “Our revolt was right but joining the coalition was wrong”. But it was the need of the time. It is true that we committed some mistakes and couldn’t get enough proportional representation (PR) votes in federal and provincial polls in 2022. We were unnecessarily flexible while making seat allocations with other coalition partners in a number of constituencies. We also strongly opposed the proposals of coalition partners in certain constituencies and fought on our own strength and won seats. For instance, the CPN (Maoist Centre) didn’t cooperate with us in my own constituency in Rautahat. They didn’t vote for us. But I still won. We fought elections in some palikas [local units] on our own and won majority seats there. But in certain areas our local leaders couldn’t properly negotiate with other partners. Now we should neither be over-reliant on the election coalitions nor do we need to criticise it. Others will recognise us only if we increase our strength. We have had mixed experiences in the past three years. We should be encouraged and optimistic about the future.But our observation from outside is that your party failed in the elections. It couldn’t even secure national party status and you have done poorly on the organisation front as well. The situation would be drastically different had all the friends who were initially with us remained active with firm commitment. Some friends lost confidence. Therefore, we couldn’t perform as per the expectations. But our party has produced exemplary results in Madhes Province. We were doing well in Rautahat district even until the latest by-polls. My activeness has never diminished and I have left no stone unturned in terms of inspiring other leaders. But everyone should actively work to build a party. Some people talk big but don’t take responsibility.You touched on what went wrong in terms of securing PR votes. Could you elaborate?Our situation would be much better had we fielded more candidates, at least in provincial seats. Our party chapters and members would have been more active in the constituencies if our candidates were in the field. The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal made a smart move in this connection. The JSP fielded more candidates for provincial seats. From the start, JSP leaders used to wonder in coalition meetings about how they would get PR votes if their candidates aren’t in the constituencies. As our party members joined the campaigns for common candidates of the coalition, they couldn’t ask for votes in our party’s election symbol ‘pen’ in the PR category. Had we mobilised separate teams to campaign for the PR votes, we could have easily crossed the threshold for PR seats in the House of Representatives. Don’t you think the party is top-heavy with senior leaders while failing to attract new faces?We have no dearth of leaders or cadres. But we have a problem in mobilising them. In our party, the monitoring and evaluation system is weak. You can’t make one answerable unless you have an evaluation system in writing. Therefore, this time we have assigned responsibilities for just a year. Now they have to submit periodic reports of activities in their respective committees. We became too lenient and didn’t punish those who didn’t work. You led a huge organisation in the UML for one-and-half decades. But you appear to be struggling to fix issues in this relatively small organisation.See, people are becoming more selfish, self-centered and lazy. So, we have to make our evaluation system strong. As we have a strong organisation and the right ideology and values, we should now launch pro-people movements and connect with the public.Do you think the party failed to attract and mobilise people due to its continuous engagement in the government since formation and lack of attractive agenda?We don’t lack agendas. We have identified and enlisted many issues directly linked to the people’s livelihood in our political paper. We failed to reach the doorsteps of the people. For instance, if there is violence against a woman, our women chapter should immediately reach there. Likewise, the student wing should actively work for the rights of students. Some of our friends say we shouldn’t have stood in favour of endorsement of the MCC [Millennium Challenge Corporation’s compact]. They argued it was being implemented to encircle our neighbour China and establish a military base in our country. We suspected the same. But our country had already signed on to that. Different interpretations of the concept related to the project emerged. Some described it as a part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy. When we studied the matter, we found CPN-UML chair KP Oli was all set to endorse the compact without any changes in the text, bypassing us. Oli put forward five conditions for that before then prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. The conditions included impeaching Speaker Agni Sapkota for not taking action against us [UML had demanded that the Speaker strip 14 lawmakers who quit UML to form the new party of their positions], scrapping our party’s registration in the Election Commission and removing us from the coalition. But Deuba ji stood against that. Then, we found a middle way, which was to endorse the compact with a 12-point explanatory note. So that was the right decision. The government earlier this month signed the framework for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation agreement with China. What is your view on this?It is natural to take it [BRI] forward as we have implemented the MCC of the US and have joined hands with other countries and multilateral agencies to carry out our development activities. The projects to be built under the BRI have no strategic or military connections and are based on mutual benefit. So there is no need to be suspicious and we have to focus on how to take maximum benefits from projects under the BRI.Just a few days ago, you met and talked to Bamdev Gautam, who appears ready to join your party. What is the progress on this?He has said he is ready to join and accept our party’s decisions. We are discussing this. He has played an important role in critical political junctures. He strongly supported me during the second People’s Movement in 2006. A political party needs such leaders. We are thinking of concluding this process [of welcoming him] soon.What about Bhim Rawal joining the party?Unhappy with the party leadership, he has been inactive in the UML but he has not made up his mind to join our party.Is finalising Gautam’s hierarchy and role in the party taking time?There won’t be an issue in the case of Bamdev ji. But overall, the number of leaders in our party is big. In the Chinese Communist Party, there are only seven members in the Politburo Standing Committee and 17 members in Other Politburo Members. But there are 24 members in our party’s central secretariat, 41 in the standing committee and 108 members in the politburo. Those who get a candidacy in the election celebrate but those who don’t get a ticket become inactive. Some others fight for ministerial posts. Yet others complain about not getting a ‘lucrative’ ministry. We have to manage them all.What about reunifying the party with the UML or the Maoist Centre? Many say leaders are more comfortable with the Maoist Centre but party cadres are for rejoining the UML.Most of our cadres are from the UML background. That might have played a role. But at present there is no possibility of our reunification with the UML. Also, the situation isn’t right to forge unity with the Maoist Centre.It is said that there is pressure from party members for reunification with the UML?That’s not true. There is a negative view about us in the UML and therefore our party rank and file wouldn’t be ready to surrender. Some might be lobbying for entry into the UML for personal benefits. Even if some join the UML, it won’t be easy for them there.But some noted leaders such as Ram Kumari Jhakri who had strongly supported you in the course of building this party have said that the Unified Socialist can’t run like this and that it is better to merge with the UML?I also enquired about her remarks but she said her intent had been misunderstood. But I repeat that there is no possibility of unity with the UML. We studied the possibility of unity with the Maoist Centre but concluded that we can’t accept Maoism and we also found their election symbol inappropriate. So the process has stopped. For now, we will concentrate on strengthening our own party.How is the Unified Socialist different from the UML?Our’s is a policy-driven party and not leader-centric. Committee system prevails in our organisation, not the leader’s orders. We discard rightist approaches and follow revolutionary ideas. We don’t see these qualities in the UML. Only our party has a policy of ‘Socialism with Nepali Characteristics’. We prioritise our agenda based on justice, fair distribution, production and good governance. There was a period when socialism stressed only on equality and therefore some termed it a distribution of poverty but we believe socialism as a principle of prosperity. Capitalism focuses only on profits even at the cost of people’s lives and wars but socialism values people’s lives and livelihoods. So, we are clearly against capitalism and in favour of socialism. But there are different forms of capitalism. We are for promoting national capitalism and eliminating comprador capitalists. We need to invite and welcome foreign investment to increase production in the country.Your party held its general convention in July first week and it took months to elect other office bearers and assign roles and responsibilities. Why?It shouldn’t have happened. Some wrong elements entered our party. Some showed immaturity by raising the issue of ‘new generation’. That spoiled the situation. Building a party is not easy. It calls for many things including ideological clarity, capacity to lead the organisation efficiently and an accepted personality. We have to learn from this episode and remove the mistrust that cropped up in this course. ","summary":"The CPN (Unified Socialist) was formed in August 2021 by a group of dissident CPN-UML leaders including two former party chiefs and ex-prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal. The party, which has 10 seats in the federal lower house is struggling with organisation building, re-elected Nepal as party chief in July. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Chairman Nepal to hear his assessment of the new party’s three years and his future plans for it.How do you review the first three years of your party?First, we have to start with the question of if the formation of this party was necessary. We made the absolutely right move by revolting [against the CPN-UML leadership’s actions]. We foiled the attempts to trample on the constitution and stopped the autocratic, regressive, rightist and individualistic tendencies from prevailing in Nepali politics. Our moves have been politically, legally as well as constitutionally justified, with even the Supreme Court validating them. After that, we displaced the then [KP Sharma Oli-led] government, and brought national politics on the right track. We then formed this party. Politics doesn’t always go in a straight line. In politics, you face ups and downs, twists and turns and sometimes turbulence. Those who are powerful today could become weak and may disappear over time. Weaker forces may get stronger. Some of our friends say, “Our revolt was right but joining the coalition was wrong”. But it was the need of the time. It is true that we committed some mistakes and couldn’t get enough proportional representation (PR) votes in federal and provincial polls in 2022. We were unnecessarily flexible while making seat allocations with other coalition partners in a number of constituencies. We also strongly opposed the proposals of coalition partners in certain constituencies and fought on our own strength and won seats. For instance, the CPN (Maoist Centre) didn’t cooperate with us in my own constituency in Rautahat. They didn’t vote for us. But I still won. We fought elections in some palikas [local units] on our own and won majority seats there. But in certain areas our local leaders couldn’t properly negotiate with other partners. Now we should neither be over-reliant on the election coalitions nor do we need to criticise it. Others will recognise us only if we increase our strength. We have had mixed experiences in the past three years. We should be encouraged and optimistic about the future.But our observation from outside is that your party failed in the elections. It couldn’t even secure national party status and you have done poorly on the organisation front as well. The situation would be drastically different had all the friends who were initially with us remained active with firm commitment. Some friends lost confidence. Therefore, we couldn’t perform as per the expectations. But our party has produced exemplary results in Madhes Province. We were doing well in Rautahat district even until the latest by-polls. My activeness has never diminished and I have left no stone unturned in terms of inspiring other leaders. But everyone should actively work to build a party. Some people talk big but don’t take responsibility.You touched on what went wrong in terms of securing PR votes. Could you elaborate?Our situation would be much better had we fielded more candidates, at least in provincial seats. Our party chapters and members would have been more active in the constituencies if our candidates were in the field. The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal made a smart move in this connection. The JSP fielded more candidates for provincial seats. From the start, JSP leaders used to wonder in coalition meetings about how they would get PR votes if their candidates aren’t in the constituencies. As our party members joined the campaigns for common candidates of the coalition, they couldn’t ask for votes in our party’s election symbol ‘pen’ in the PR category. Had we mobilised separate teams to campaign for the PR votes, we could have easily crossed the threshold for PR seats in the House of Representatives. Don’t you think the party is top-heavy with senior leaders while failing to attract new faces?We have no dearth of leaders or cadres. But we have a problem in mobilising them. In our party, the monitoring and evaluation system is weak. You can’t make one answerable unless you have an evaluation system in writing. Therefore, this time we have assigned responsibilities for just a year. Now they have to submit periodic reports of activities in their respective committees. We became too lenient and didn’t punish those who didn’t work. You led a huge organisation in the UML for one-and-half decades. But you appear to be struggling to fix issues in this relatively small organisation.See, people are becoming more selfish, self-centered and lazy. So, we have to make our evaluation system strong. As we have a strong organisation and the right ideology and values, we should now launch pro-people movements and connect with the public.Do you think the party failed to attract and mobilise people due to its continuous engagement in the government since formation and lack of attractive agenda?We don’t lack agendas. We have identified and enlisted many issues directly linked to the people’s livelihood in our political paper. We failed to reach the doorsteps of the people. For instance, if there is violence against a woman, our women chapter should immediately reach there. Likewise, the student wing should actively work for the rights of students. Some of our friends say we shouldn’t have stood in favour of endorsement of the MCC [Millennium Challenge Corporation’s compact]. They argued it was being implemented to encircle our neighbour China and establish a military base in our country. We suspected the same. But our country had already signed on to that. Different interpretations of the concept related to the project emerged. Some described it as a part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy. When we studied the matter, we found CPN-UML chair KP Oli was all set to endorse the compact without any changes in the text, bypassing us. Oli put forward five conditions for that before then prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. The conditions included impeaching Speaker Agni Sapkota for not taking action against us [UML had demanded that the Speaker strip 14 lawmakers who quit UML to form the new party of their positions], scrapping our party’s registration in the Election Commission and removing us from the coalition. But Deuba ji stood against that. Then, we found a middle way, which was to endorse the compact with a 12-point explanatory note. So that was the right decision. The government earlier this month signed the framework for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation agreement with China. What is your view on this?It is natural to take it [BRI] forward as we have implemented the MCC of the US and have joined hands with other countries and multilateral agencies to carry out our development activities. The projects to be built under the BRI have no strategic or military connections and are based on mutual benefit. So there is no need to be suspicious and we have to focus on how to take maximum benefits from projects under the BRI.Just a few days ago, you met and talked to Bamdev Gautam, who appears ready to join your party. What is the progress on this?He has said he is ready to join and accept our party’s decisions. We are discussing this. He has played an important role in critical political junctures. He strongly supported me during the second People’s Movement in 2006. A political party needs such leaders.

How is the coalition of the two biggest political parties faring? The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Krishna Khanal, a professor of political science, for his insights.How do you evaluate the performance of the Congress-UML government based on the pledges they made at the time of coalition formation?Two biggest parties getting together to form a government is a bit unusual in the system we have adopted. The strength of the system is that the government can be made accountable by a strong opposition. But when the two biggest parties join hands to run the government, the opposition in the House becomes weak. This is a concern. The Congress and the UML have had joint governments in critical junctures in the past. Now, there is no extraordinary situation requiring them to forge a coalition but they justified it saying it would end political instability. Their argument was that unreasonable bargaining of smaller parties made the prime ministers weak. That’s partially true. However, the crux of the matter is that they wanted to enjoy consolidated power. KP Oli wanted to be prime minister and the Congress leaders who were out of power wanted to return to Singha Durbar. So they signed the seven-point deal with the pledge of amending the constitution.Has this coalition been a success? What are the initial indications?There are certain curious things. The seven-point agreement doesn’t say the UML will hand over government leadership to the Congress in the second phase of their partnership. It says, after two years, UML chair Oli will hand it over to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. It shows how our parties have become leader-centric instead of institution-centric. After all, Oli and Deuba are the chiefs and parliamentary leaders of their respective parties and they are the ones who will lead the government. Still they wished to specifically mention their names, which indicates they still feel insecure. Likewise, Prime Minister Oli says that he is handing over power to Deuba in July 2026. Recently he said he is handing it over after 18 months. Despite there being a written agreement, he keeps repeating the timeline. This suggests mutual mistrust due to past records of betrayal. It is true that the Congress and the UML together have a strong majority in the House and, with the backing of a few other smaller forces, they can manage two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. But when it comes to political issues, even the small parties in the coalition are hardly on the same page. So numerical strength alone won’t work. Hence there has been no progress on constitution amendment in the past five months. These pledges were made just to create a pretext to get to power.Is the present government any different to the erstwhile Dahal-led coalition, particularly on delivery?No. In the seven-point agreement, they pledged to improve the ailing economy. We don’t find any reform and the economy is still stagnant. I can’t recall a single thing this government has done that is worth appreciating. The only thing this coalition has achieved is ending unusual power manoeuverings by Prachanda [Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. The way Dahal was switching alliance partners between the Congress and the UML was unnatural. The present coalition ended the trend, at least for now. Also, some unhealthy activities taking place in provinces have been stopped. But the government has utterly failed to provide any relief to the people. What about the process of amending the constitution?The Congress and the UML leaders have often blamed the proportional representation (PR) electoral system for the country’s political instability. The UML proposed to limit the scope of the PR system to the National Assembly and some Congress leaders have also floated this idea. After the formation of this government, many people assumed that this coalition may take some action to implement those propositions. But doing so is not easy. Despite a strong majority in the House, the Congress and the UML alone can’t amend the constitution. Other small parties won’t support them to water down the PR system. The top leaders are conspicuously silent as they know diverse issues are going to open up once they start the process. For instance, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party wants to revive Hindu monarchy and the Madhes-based parties have their own grievances. Moreover, if you analyse the election results since 2008, it’s not difficult to infer that not only small parties but even the major forces will think twice before making any changes to the PR system. Be it big or small, old or new parties, all have gotten a significant number of seats under the PR category. In the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008, the Congress and the UML were in crisis. It was the PR system that saved them from being pushed into an existential crisis. Besides that, there is one big political reason behind the adoption of this electoral system and that is to ensure representation of various underprivileged communities in state organs. We can’t forget that context. Hence the Congress and UML leaders have been silent on the constitution amendment in the past couple of months.Is there any need to review or amend the constitution?There is a need to seriously review and analyse the problems faced in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. For instance, the vice-president has no role. He can be made ex-officio chair of the National Assembly, as in India. Then, the state doesn’t need to elect the upper house chair. This option was discussed during constitution writing as well. Recently, we conducted by-polls to fill the vacant positions of chiefs of local units. These polls were unnecessary as there can be a provision to entrust the deputy chiefs with the responsibility of carrying out the chief’s duties when the position goes vacant. There is a need for a comprehensive review and changes in some provisions based on the practical experience of statute implementation. But there are different parties and groups that want to raise different political agendas. For instance, some want a more powerful federal system while others want to scrap the system and revive Hindu monarchy. How should we review the national charter and what kind of mechanism will be right for that?The best way is through a review commission composed of politicians and subject experts. But leaders don’t trust independent experts who don’t follow their instructions. Forming a body of experts loyal to the leaders is meaningless. Therefore, a special parliamentary committee can be entrusted with this task. The panel will be composed of members from political parties based on their strength in the House. The parties and other stakeholders can submit their formal proposals to the committee and the experts can give their inputs to the same panel. The body can help give shape to the ongoing debates and discussions will take place in a more organised and formal way. It can conduct a thorough study of the complications seen in the course of constitution implementation. My emphasis is not on amending the constitution on political grounds but from the perspectives of removing difficulties experienced in the course of implementation. For instance, provinces have failed to prove their relevance. Now, we need to study where the problems are. But I don’t think the political parties are going to work on this issue with the seriousness it deserves. Leaders, of late, have proposed to increase the threshold to secure seats under the PR category, which can be done by amending election laws. They have floated the idea of increasing the PR threshold to five percent. [At present, it is three percent at the federal and 1.5 percent at the provincial level]. If it is increased to five percent, hardly four or five political parties may qualify for the PR seats. So this is not an appropriate proposal. To ensure political stability, we have to instead develop a system supportive of a coalition culture. The problem lies in our leaders and not in the constitution. For instance, why did Prachanda switch alliances multiple times after the last election? There is no point in blaming the system for instability. To discuss and debate all these issues, we need a review body.What is your analysis of the recent local by-polls results?The voting pattern shows that the big parties couldn’t increase their vote shares and failed to attract voters. The Congress lost more seats in comparison to the last by-polls. The UML had mixed results while the Maoist Centre made some gains. As it fought single-handedly this time, the Congress lost some seats that it had won with the support of alliance partners last time. This is natural. The Maoist Centre appears to have benefitted by being in the opposition and as it concentrated its strengths in select areas for the past few months. Party chief Dahal himself visited some remote local units. The Congress doesn’t appear serious about reviewing its poor performance while the UML has decided to study the matter and find what went wrong. The Maoist leaders look excited but the party has not made much progress in popular votes. There are assumptions of some informal collaborations between the Maoist Centre and the Rastriya Swatantra Party. The way Dahal has defended Rabi Lamichhane in recent days backs the assumption.Why do you think the performance of new forces including the RSP and Janamat were poor in the by-polls?My assumption is that voters rethought the need to change the party of their choice if the main objective of the leaders from new parties is to be ministers. RSP chief Rabi Lamichhane insisted on becoming home minister. In the meantime, recent investigations have shown his linkages to cooperative scams. People might have thought that he is not a clean person. These factors might have played a role. Last time, people supported new forces not to make their leaders ministers but for political reforms. The chief minister from Janamat Party who is leading the provincial government in Madhesh formed a 20-member Cabinet, which is the biggest ever there. He downsized it only after severe criticism. Such developments certainly play a role in elections. These are just assumptions. We can’t jump to conclusions but it is safe to say that Nepali voters are consistently trying to find better alternatives.While there were reports of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari rejoining the UML to return to active politics, former Vice-President Nanda Bahadur Pun is most likely to join the Maoist Centre. What kind of precedent will this set?I don’t see serious problems in former vice-presidents rejoining active politics as they don’t play any vital role as vice-presidents. But the issue of former Presidents returning to active politics is serious as such a precedent will invite serious anomalies. Though the constitution and laws don't bar former presidents from making such a comeback, politics should be guided by certain values, principles and convictions. Bhandari’s return to active politics will be unfortunate. It should be stopped.

Such developments certainly play a role in elections. These are just assumptions. We can’t jump to conclusions but it is safe to say that Nepali voters are consistently trying to find better alternatives.While there were reports of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari rejoining the UML to return to active politics, former Vice-President Nanda Bahadur Pun is most likely to join the Maoist Centre. What kind of precedent will this set?I don’t see serious problems in former vice-presidents rejoining active politics as they don’t play any vital role as vice-presidents. But the issue of former Presidents returning to active politics is serious as such a precedent will invite serious anomalies. Though the constitution and laws don't bar former presidents from making such a comeback, politics should be guided by certain values, principles and convictions. Bhandari’s return to active politics will be unfortunate. It should be stopped.

During the visit, the two countries signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Framework Cooperation agreement. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Bishnu Rimal, chief advisor to the prime minister, who was one of the key interlocutors during the framework agreement negotiations, for insights on how the deals were finalised between the two countries.There are many queries about the details of the agreements signed between Nepal and China last week. Please tell us about the key points.Nepal and China had been exchanging documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative of China since 2020, under the BRI implementation plan. While signing any agreement, the two countries engage in rigorous negotiations and at times it takes a long time even to finalise a word. This time, we signed a framework agreement, which is like a basket, where we have put many things. It’s different from a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In the agreement, we have described its background, principles, objectives, the modality of mobilising financial resources and implementing mechanisms. Even the previous government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to finalise it but it didn’t in the end. Now we have taken it ahead. The new agreement should be understood in a context. In 2016, we were in government [during Oli’s first tenure] and we visited Beijing. At the time, China was supporting Nepal through the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) package. Later, the support was provided through the BRI and the THMDCN became a part of it. Nepal reached an MoU to this effect in 2017. After that, an implementation plan needed to be signed. Following the formation of the present government, we held discussions on this. The two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a four-member team for this specific purpose. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and lawyer Semanta Dahal from the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Khatiwada ji and myself from the UML were in the team. In the past, we have reached several agreements with China, India, the United States, Japan and various other countries and sought support from them. But we haven’t been able to properly utilise the support. Our [taskforce’s] focus was to ensure best use of the pledged amount and implement the agreements. At first, we studied the documents exchanged after 2020. At the beginning we forged consensus between the UML and the Congress and then shared the document with the Chinese side because it can only be implemented after it is acceptable for both sides. This time, we wanted to take the implementation process ahead because Nepal joined the BRI process years ago. Nepal has already joined China’s Global Development Initiative, which is an international development concept. But there were some confusions about our participation in development projects under the BRI. There needed to be more clarity on our side. At times, it has been dragged into controversy. We wanted to dispel rumours and confusions.First of all we all should know that the BRI is a framework and the agreement we signed is a basket deal. Later, we will select specific projects and negotiate on particular details and conditions. In fact, the debate ahead of the prime minister’s visit was driven by whether to take loans or grants from China. That was wrong. It is rather a project-based approach. On certain projects, we need all grants while on certain others, we may jointly develop them. Still in other projects, we have to seek concessional loans. All these things depend on what project we are talking about. If a project can pay back the loan, that could be dealt accordingly. But our discussions were driven by the concept of loan versus grant. Even top leaders got swayed by such narratives and reacted accordingly. China has declared huge grants to Nepal multiple times since 2016. But we haven’t been able to use them as we have to earmark the amounts and seek them. First, we have to say that we are going to use this money in these projects. We at the task force concluded that the amount of the grants pledged by China is enough for us for now. There is no need to take out a loan now. Our priority is to get the grants that have been stuck for years. Do we need to select certain projects for that?Yes, we have to first finalise the projects and prepare business plans. We can explore other options only if the grant money is insufficient for a particular project. For instance, if we start working on a cross-border railway, we would discuss whether the grant money is sufficient and whether to seek more grants or go for loans. We aren’t in that stage now. We are yet to receive the grant announced during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. Similarly, grants were announced during the China visits of then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, first President Rambaran Yadav and our prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Also, this time, the Chinese President has announced 500 million RMB in assistance. So, again, first we have to work to receive and use the grant money. For instance, recently, the Chinese side announced to provide electric vehicles worth US$10 million as support through the Chinese embassy. The EVs include public buses, ambulances and school vans but they release them only after we provide the specifications of the vehicles that we need. The amount we sign as a budgetary support can be used wherever we want but other sums are released only after we earmark them for certain projects. After a long negotiation, Nepal and China have agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’. What does that mean?During the negotiation, we had used the term ‘grant and different financing modalities’. Later, we agreed to replace the word ‘grant’ with ‘aid’. We did so as we wanted to keep the door open in terms of seeking support from a country. If we say that we won’t receive any support except grants, it creates complications in the overall investment scenario. The Chinese government may provide a certain amount of grant to the government of Nepal but it doesn’t give it to the private sector.If Nepal’s private sector plans to attract investment from China, the World Bank, the ADB or any other agencies, for example for a mega hydro project, they may not get it as the Chinese side knows that Nepal accepts only grants and no other form of investment. Such a condition creates complications as this agreement is applicable even for the private sector. Therefore, we didn’t want to close the door. We can’t say we accept loans from this country but not from the other. We accept assistance that serves our national interest.Will the negotiations now onward be project-specific then?Yes. It will be project and proposal specific. Such issues will be negotiated only when we discuss a certain project. Therefore, the ongoing debate over grants versus loan is pointless. For instance, we didn’t receive certain portions of the assistance announced by India immediately after the 2015 earthquakes. Such is also the case with China and with other countries on occasions as the conditions attached to them weren’t acceptable to us.After the failure in operating Pokhara Regional International Airport due to lack of business plans, people are now suspicious about the utilisation of any assistance fruitfully.How can you say the Pokhara airport project is a failure? First, one should study the airport’s capacity and check how many passengers are flying to Pokhara now. A good number of people are flying there. I think the interest rate on the loan we took from China to build the airport is no different to the rate we receive from the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral agencies. We can debate whether we have been able to operate the airport in its full capacity. But there is no need to scandalise it unnecessarily.Ahead of the prime minister’s visit, there were voices that Nepal should seek a waiver of Pokhara airport loan from China. What happened?Let me ask you a question. Imagine, you took a loan from Rastriya Banijya Bank to meet your needs. Say, there is a government led by a leader who favours you. Can the prime minister waive off your bank loan? No. You have to follow the system. So your question is wrong. The Pokhara airport deal is not a grant. It’s a commercial deal. Those who run the government can’t use the language of Durga Prasai, who threatens not to pay back bank loans. What are the agreements on road connectivity and cross-border railway projects?We have included five points under the infrastructure-urban development project. These are Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel, Hilsa Simkot Road Project, Kathmandu-Khandbari Road, Kimathanka Bridge, the cross-border railway project from Rasuwagadhi to Kathmandu and the Amargadhi City Hall. Likewise, we have included a cross-border transmission line to start energy trade with China. Under education and health, we agreed to establish universities and colleges. The Chinese side is carrying out a feasibility study of the railway project with a plan to complete it by 2026. Once the study is complete, we will discuss the funding modalities and business plans.What is the status of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel project?The China side is in a position to complete its feasibility study. After that, construction work will start.Nepal has signed so many agreements with China. While we have progressed a lot on paper, there is little progress on the ground. Will the present agreement make any substantive change in this connection?Nepal is behind on monitoring and follow up. We should have formed bilateral mechanisms and monitored work progress. Now, there is a sense of urgency in the government to expedite development works. An inter-agency mechanism will be formed within our government. It will monitor and facilitate the work and the line ministries will execute the plans.Why are the agreements signed with China not made public, unlike the deals inked with other countries?There is no problem in making them public because there is nothing to hide. But all agreements aren’t made public. The MCC Compact had to be taken to the parliament as people were divided over it. Then, it was publicly debated. Likewise, people are now expressing their curiosity towards the BRI documents. But there are many projects people don’t care about. When needed, the documents can be made public as nothing can be hidden these days. And there is nothing wrong in making them public.UMl’s coalition partner Congress was reportedly reluctant to sign the framework agreement. What was its concern?That is a wrong narrative. Both the UML and the Congress were on the same page. It was possible to conclude the agreements because we had consensus.But the Congress leaders expressed their concerns in public ahead of the visit and even after the signing of the deals.We have to follow the party’s official decisions, not the statements of individual leaders. How would it have been possible to reach agreements if there were differences in the two-party taskforce, in the leadership and the party’s official positions? It’s a Nepal-China agreement jointly done by the UML and the Congress, and backed by all other parties. The prime minister convened a meeting of former prime ministers and foreign ministers ahead of his visit. All of them advised the prime minister to sign the agreement with China. Why was the signing of the agreement delayed?While signing a bilateral agreement, we can’t think only from our perspective. Negotiation always takes long. The joint statement has stated that the two sides are ready to sign the BRI framework as soon as possible. It took time for us to share the documents with the Chinese side after we reached Beijing. It’s not like two leaders just sit, discuss and sign on that. They have to consult concerned ministries, departments and officials. The Chinese worked overnight after we submitted the documents. My impression is that the Chinese side showed magnanimity and adopted a short-cut approach and signed on the deals. They were ready to sign the agreements on our conditions. That was a wonderful gesture.What were the specific points of contention and how were they resolved?We substantially edited the documents that were exchanged in the past, making them more specific and converting them into a framework of cooperation. Therefore, the Chinese side needed at least a day to study them. They argued that it would work even without mentioning the word ‘grant’. In view of the narratives in Nepal, we proposed to use ‘grant’ or a word with similar meaning. Then, we proposed ‘aid assistance financing’, and they accepted the term.How will the new deal be implemented?There used to be confusion about whether a certain project is under the BRI. China said even the Pokhara airport project is under the BRI while we said it was initiated before that. Now onward, all projects with China will be under the BRI cooperation. All the financing and investments from China will enter Nepal through the BRI window. We will prioritise the projects already proposed and under study such as the railway project, Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, and Madan Bhandari University. We have agreed to strengthen connectivity on border points and work will be expedited there. That will help transform Nepal from a land-locked into a land-linked country.Why are the projects being developed with Chinese involvement so slow?These days the Chinese side tells us to give projects only after clearing the sites. For instance, the 17-km Syafrubeshi-Rasuwagadhi road is to be built by Chinese grants. There is one transmission pole standing in the way. We are yet to remove it from the construction site. They haven’t started the work citing the same reason. Creating an environment to work on the field is our responsibility. It’s not that only China-built projects are slow. Such is also the story with our projects with other countries and agencies. Even in the case of the MCC projects, it took a long time to finalise many issues. We are too slow in implementing agreements and executing projects. First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  ","summary":"Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned home on December 5 after a four-day official visit to China.

Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best. ","summary":"Wang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries.
