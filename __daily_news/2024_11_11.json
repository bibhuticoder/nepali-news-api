Trump impeachment1610534633_1024.jpg","category":"global","content":"\n    WASHINGTON:Â US President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday made his first cabinet appointment after his decisive election win, while signaling his intent to ditch the outgoing administration's policies by talking to Vladimir Putin.Trump's campaign manager Susie Wiles will serve as his White House chief of staff, the first woman to be named to the high-profile role and the Republican's first appointment to his incoming administration.\nTrump's crushing defeat of Democrat Kamala Harris is already shaking up US and world politics, just two days after Election Day and two-and-a-half months before he returns to the White House.\nPutin, the Russian president, hailed Trump as \"courageous\" for the way he handled himself following an assassination attempt at a rally in July, and said he was \"ready\" to hold discussions with him.\nBillionaire Trump later told NBC News that he had not talked to Putin, the authoritarian leader whom he has repeatedly praised over the years, since his victory but \"I think we'll speak.\"\nIt marked a seismic shift from the icy silence that has existed between Biden and Putin since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, and underscored Trump's criticism of US support for Kyiv.\nThe president-elect has previously said he would push through a peace deal in that conflict -- but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who spoke to Trump on Wednesday, said calls for a ceasefire were \"dangerous.\"\nChinese President Xi Jinping had earlier joined the list of foreign leaders congratulating Trump, who was criticized by Harris during the election campaign for being too friendly with autocrats.\nTrump doubled down on his plans for mass deportations of undocumented migrants, telling NBC he had \"no choice\" and that there could be \"no price tag\" that was too much.\n- 'Orderly' -\nAs Trump began to work at his Florida resort on his transition team, Biden pledged a peaceful and \"orderly\" transfer of power.\nBiden, 81, urged Americans in a solemn televised address to \"bring down the temperature,\" in stark contrast to Trump's refusal to accept his 2020 election defeat.\nThe Democrat has invited Trump for talks at the White House. But Biden's spokeswoman said Trump's team had not yet signed key documents allowing the legal transition process to start.\nIn his speech from the Rose Garden of the White House, Biden called for unity while urging Democrats not to lose hope, saying: \"Remember, a defeat does not mean we are defeated.\"\nYet finger-pointing has already erupted in the party over Biden's initial decision to run for a second term despite his age, before dropping out at the last minute in July and handing the reins to Harris, his vice president.\nThe White House denied Biden had any regrets. \"He believed it was the right decision to make at that time,\" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.\nTrump's election in the face of a criminal conviction for fraud, two impeachments and the fact that he is the oldest-ever elected president at 78 reflected voters' desire for change from the Biden years.\nVoter concerns over the economy and migration drove Trump's victory.\n- Trump 2.0 -\nTrump's first cabinet pick Wiles enjoys wide support within his team and was notably called on stage during his victory speech on Wednesday morning.\n\"Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected.

But Biden's spokeswoman said Trump's team had not yet signed key documents allowing the legal transition process to start.\nIn his speech from the Rose Garden of the White House, Biden called for unity while urging Democrats not to lose hope, saying: \"Remember, a defeat does not mean we are defeated.\"\nYet finger-pointing has already erupted in the party over Biden's initial decision to run for a second term despite his age, before dropping out at the last minute in July and handing the reins to Harris, his vice president.\nThe White House denied Biden had any regrets. \"He believed it was the right decision to make at that time,\" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.\nTrump's election in the face of a criminal conviction for fraud, two impeachments and the fact that he is the oldest-ever elected president at 78 reflected voters' desire for change from the Biden years.\nVoter concerns over the economy and migration drove Trump's victory.\n- Trump 2.0 -\nTrump's first cabinet pick Wiles enjoys wide support within his team and was notably called on stage during his victory speech on Wednesday morning.\n\"Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected.

   By Jason StanleyNEW YORK: Like others, since late Tuesday night, my phone has been blaring with text messages asking how this could have happened (as some of my friends, colleagues, and acquaintances know, I had been fully convinced that Donald Trump would win this election handily). Instead of responding in detail to every message, I will offer my explanation here.\nFor 2,300 years, at least since Platoâs Republic, philosophers have known how demagogues and aspiring tyrants win democratic elections. The process is straightforward, and we have now just watched it play out.\nIn a democracy, anyone is free to run for office, including people who are thoroughly unsuitable to lead or preside over the institutions of government. One telltale sign of unsuitability is a willingness to lie with abandon, specifically by representing oneself as a defender against the peopleâs perceived enemies, both external and internal. Plato regarded ordinary people as being easily controlled by their emotions, and thus susceptible to such messaging â an argument that forms the true foundation of democratic political philosophy (as I have argued in previous work).\nPhilosophers have also always known that this kind of politics is not necessarily destined to succeed. As Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued, democracy is at its most vulnerable when inequality in a society has become entrenched and grown too glaring. Deep social and economic disparities create the conditions for demagogues to prey on peopleâs resentments, and for democracy ultimately to fall in the way that Plato described. Rousseau thus concluded that democracy requires widespread equality; only then can peopleâs resentments not be exploited so easily. \nIn my own work, I have tried to describe, in minute detail, why and how people who feel slighted (materially or socially) come to accept pathologies â racism, homophobia, misogyny, ethnic nationalism, and religious bigotry â which, under conditions of greater equality, they would reject.\nAnd it is precisely those material conditions for a healthy, stable democracy that the United States lacks today. If anything, America has come to be singularly defined by its massive wealth inequality, a phenomenon that cannot but undermine social cohesion and breed resentment. With 2,300 years of democratic political philosophy suggesting that democracy is not sustainable under such conditions, no one should be surprised by the outcome of the 2024 election.\nBut why, one might ask, has this not already happened in the US? The main reason is that there had been an unspoken agreement among politicians not to engage in such an extraordinarily divisive and violent form of politics. Recall the 2008 election. John McCain, the Republican, could have appealed to racist stereotypes or conspiracy theories about Barack Obamaâs birth, but he refused to take this path, famously correcting one of his own supporters when she suggested that the Democratic candidate was a foreign-born âArab.â McCain lost, but he is remembered as an American statesperson of unimpeachable integrity.\nOf course, American politicians regularly appeal more subtly to racism and homophobia to win elections; it is, after all, a successful strategy. But the tacit agreement not to conduct such a politics explicitly â what the political theorist Tali Mendelberg calls the norm of equality â ruled out appealing too openly to racism. Instead, it had to be done through hidden messages, dog whistles, and stereotypes (such as by talking about âlaziness and crime in the inner cityâ).\nBut under conditions of deep inequality, this coded brand of politics eventually becomes less effective than the explicit kind. What Trump has done since 2016 is throw out the old tacit agreement, labeling immigrants as vermin and his political opponents as âthe enemies within.â Such an explicit âus versus themâ politics, as philosophers have always known, can be highly effective.\nDemocratic political philosophy, then, has been correct in its analysis of the Trump phenomenon. Tragically, it also offers a clear prediction of what will come next. According to Plato, the kind of person who campaigns this way will rule as a tyrant. \nFrom everything Trump has said and done during this campaign and in his first term, we can expect Plato to be vindicated once again. The Republican Partyâs domination of all branches of government would render the US a one-party state. The future may offer occasional opportunities for others to vie for power, but whatever political contests lie ahead most likely will not qualify as free and fair elections.\nJason Stanley, Professor of Philosophy at Yale University, is the author of How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them (Random House, 2018).Project Syndicate, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"\n    By Jason StanleyNEW YORK: Like others, since late Tuesday night, my phone has been blaring with text messages asking how this could have happened (as some of my friends, colleagues, and acquaintances know, I had been fully convinced that Donald Trump would win this election handily).

The 29th edition of the Conference of Parties (COP) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is taking place in Baku from November 11 to 22.Some hours back, Chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group at UN Climate Change negotiations, Evans Njewa, made a post on X (formerly Twitter): \"Setting a science-based New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance that meets the evolving needs of developing countries, especially LDCs, is critical. LDCs need at least 1 trillion US Dollars to implement current NDCs by 2030.\"\nThe Chair further stressed 'Grants, not loans.' \nClimate finance is not a new topic. However, wordings surrounding it and climate negotiations are framed in a manner that creates bureaucratic and time-consuming procedures to understand and deal with, while the climate extremes are already taking a toll on unprecedented scale and intensity. At a time when LDCs like Nepal are crying out for easier access to climate finance for climate adaptation, mitigation, resilience and response to loss and damage, the process is getting lengthy and finicky.\nBuilding new phrases and making climate negotiation lengthy and process cumbersome in the face of climate extremes at a warp-speed has raised the question of whether such mega events have delivered to those demanding justice for long.\nOnce the phrasing 'phase out', and 'phase down' dominated the negotiation while 'loss and damage', and 'transitioning away from fossil fuel' emerged prominently later. This time, the terminology 'new collective quantified goals' (NCQG) is taking a centre stage.

Although the climate crises are effacing previous records one after another irrespective of geography, the resource-rich countries are still in relative comfort and the LDCs in a condition to beg for assistance reminding the earlier of exploiting fossil fuel and boiling the planet for their developments.\nLivable earth is cherished by all where they dream and realize fulfilling lives. But, chimneys, furnaces and boilers are worldwide. Here, is it worth mentioning that the late veteran climate scientist and activist Saleemul Huq used to argue that the polluters and greenhouse gas emitters are everywhere- north and south, rich and poor, east and west. Of course, even the poor countries have rich companies and business tycoons that burn fossil fuel and heat the planet.\nNational responsibility\nWhen it comes to the domestic front and sharing country's plights and pains caused by climate change before the international community, Nepal must make the world aware of the crises like Thame glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) and the recent (Sept 27-28) rains that triggered floods and landslide in various districts including the Kathmandu Valley itself. The impacts of climate crises on Nepal's agriculture, health, biodiversity, livelihood and development efforts need wide-ranging articulation. \nHowever, the devastations caused by the Roshi and Koshi River floods in the wake of two-day nonstop rains in September cannot be linked only to climate change.

The quarries of stone, extraction of sand, and crusher industries running rife in the surrounding districts of the Kathmandu Valley are blatant examples of governments' (of all three tiers) sheer neglect to environmental concern.

The 29th edition of the Conference of Parties (COP) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is taking place in Baku from November 11 to 22.Some hours back, Chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group at UN Climate Change negotiations, Evans Njewa, made a post on X (formerly Twitter): \"Setting a science-based New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance that meets the evolving needs of developing countries, especially LDCs, is critical. LDCs need at least 1 trillion US Dollars to implement current NDCs by 2030.\"\nThe Chair further stressed 'Grants, not loans.' \nClimate finance is not a new topic. However, wordings surrounding it and climate negotiations are framed in a manner that creates bureaucratic and time-consuming procedures to understand and deal with, while the climate extremes are already taking a toll on unprecedented scale and intensity. At a time when LDCs like Nepal are crying out for easier access to climate finance for climate adaptation, mitigation, resilience and response to loss and damage, the process is getting lengthy and finicky.\nBuilding new phrases and making climate negotiation lengthy and process cumbersome in the face of climate extremes at a warp-speed has raised the question of whether such mega events have delivered to those demanding justice for long.\nOnce the phrasing 'phase out', and 'phase down' dominated the negotiation while 'loss and damage', and 'transitioning away from fossil fuel' emerged prominently later. This time, the terminology 'new collective quantified goals' (NCQG) is taking a centre stage. It is indeed a testing time how the negotiators from various blocs, including LDCs, persuade superpowers and rising economies reminding their historic burning of fossil fuel and press them for the augmented flow of finance to mitigate the rising threats posed by climate extremes. \nIf the countries with the historic responsibility of boiling the planet with continuous burning of fossil fuel since industrialization think of humanity, there can be no more conducive event than the COP29 to deliver climate finance with renewed ambitions. \nAsked how the countries crying for climate justice were suffering the worst climate disasters at home and attending negotiations were taking COP29, an ardent advocate of climate finance and Executive Director of Prakriti Resource Centre, Raju Pandit Chhetri, admitted that the process was lengthy as it is a multilateral process. \"The climate negotiations going on for years in COP are obviously time-taking because these are multilateral dialogues where as many as 197 countries put forth for their stands in addition to sharing national practices and climate ambitions.\" \nHe defended the NCQG saying that it is built upon the Paris Agreement to which the States are parties. \"NCQG is more science-driven and needs and priorities of the developing countries than the earlier commitment of 100 billion dollars.

Jointly led by Prakash Subedi, a Technical Project Manager in BMW's 5G Research and Development team, and his wife, Srishti Gaihre Subedi, a Senior Software Engineer at SAP, the initiative offeredÂ students a hands-on glimpse into the world of engineering. After returning from Germany, the couple volunteered their expertise to inspire young minds in Chitwan, conducting this free training to foster enthusiasm for technology and robotics. The program was supported by the German organization GIZ, Diaspora 2030, and the Education Development and Coordination Unit, Chitwan, under the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology, providing local students a unique opportunity toÂ engage with cutting-edge science and technology over an intensive 15-day training period. The workshops, held at SOS Hermann Gmeiner School Bharatpur, Narayani Model Secondary School, and Prembasti Secondary School, reached students from grades 7 to 11, primarily in grades 9 and 10. Each student learned to build and program obstacle-avoiding robots using kits containing Arduino Uno microcontrollers, ultrasonic sensors, servo motors, motor controller boards, andÂ motors. The immersive experience allowed students to gain practical skills in electronics, coding, and robotics, while also encouraging them to explore engineering, artificial intelligence, and problem-solving approaches.Prakash noted the importance of hands-on learning, saying, 'In Germany and other European countries, it's common for students to get practical experience in robotics and programming. However, such opportunities are rare in Nepalese schools. We wanted to provide students with a sense of what's possible in engineering, AI, and problem-solving, helping them understand how technology can be used to tackle real-world challenges and inspiring them to pursue these skills beyond the classroom.' Approximately 40% of participants were girls, indicating a growing interest among both genders in technical fields.\nThe project was made possible with support from the Diaspora 2030 initiative, which connects skilled diaspora professionals with their home countries to foster positive change in education, technology, and skill development. Saurav Koirala from GIZ Kathmandu expressed his happiness with the achievements of the project, highlighting its alignment with Sustainable Development GoalÂ (SDG) 4, which promotes quality education. He remarked that projects like this are vital in raisingÂ local educational standards and inspiring students to explore STEM fields.Srishti emphasized her dedication to gender diversity in engineering, saying, 'There are very few females in engineering, and I wanted to motivate students - especially girls - to explore this field.'She shared an emotional moment from the workshop when Bikisha Acharya, a trainee from Prembasti Secondary School, expressed her desire to become an engineer like Srishti. 'It was a very touching experience for me,' Srishti said. 'Knowing that we are inspiring young girls to see themselves in these roles is incredibly meaningful.'\nThe training concluded with a robotics competition titled 'Robo-Quest 2024: Ignite the Spark' at SOS Hermann Gmeiner School. The competition featured 55 students selected from an internal evaluation among the trainees, forming six teams of three from SOS, Narayani Model, and Prembasti schools. SOS Hermann Gmeiner School emerged as the winner, securing a cash prize of 5,000 NPR, with Prembasti Secondary School and Narayani Model Secondary School securing the second and third places, winning 4,000 and 3,000 NPR, respectively. \nBishnu Prasad Bhattarai, Unit Chief of the Education Development and Coordination Unit, Chitwan, and Bhumi Lal Sharma Subedi, Undersecretary at the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology, praised the initiative, stating, 'Training and competitions like these attract students toward science and technology. With AI and robotics transforming industries, it is essential for students to gain foundational knowledge in these areas even at the high school level.'\nThis program has left a lasting impression, inspiring students and educators alike, and marking a significant step forward in bringing technological education to Chitwan.\n","summary":"\n    CHITWAN: A pioneering robotics workshop recently held in three Chitwan schoolsÂ introduced around 155 students to the fundamentals of robot building and programming.

Questions are pressing and need proper addresses.\n"},{"hash":"f7eafd779c8e1b0bda553726555e8d9547f47854f7c2e42a6308a9103a0913ff","title":"nepal-southern-agriculture-science-and-technology-park-inaugurated","date":1731306918631,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/science-and-technology/nepal-southern-agriculture-science-and-technology-park-inaugurated","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/renu_dahal1724809543_1024.jpg","category":"science-and-technology","content":"\n    Â The Nepal Southern Agriculture Science and Technology Park of the Poverty Alleviation and Partnership Development Centre of the China-South Asian Countries was inaugurated amidst a programme here yesterday.The park is located in Chitwan-based Agriculture and Forest University. \nAt the inaugural ceremony, Mayor of Bharatpur metropolis Renu Dahal said agriculture sector covering larger population of Nepal is the mainstay of Nepali economy. \"We are hopeful that the project would contribute to address the challenges of climate change, food security and sustainable agriculture development\". \nShe thanked the agronomists of AFU for their cooperation in carrying out scientific research and experimentation aimed at increasing rice production in Nepal. \nChinese Ambassador to Nepal Chen Song said the Nepal Southern Agricultural Science and Technology Park has been inaugurated under the China-South Asian Country Poverty Alleviation and Partnership Development Center. \nHe said the project is in line with the agreement reached between the leaders of China and Nepal during President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal in 2019. \n\"This project will be successful in promoting exchange and cooperation between the two countries in the areas of trade, livelihood improvement, youth exchange and other fields and taking bilateral relations to a new height,\" he noted. \nAmbassador Chen expressed his belief that the joint effort of Nepal and China would boost up the production of paddy in Nepal in next five years.Â \n","summary":"\n    Â The Nepal Southern Agriculture Science and Technology Park of the Poverty Alleviation and Partnership Development Centre of the China-South Asian Countries was inaugurated amidst a programme here yesterday.The park is located in Chitwan-based Agriculture and Forest University. \nAt the inaugural ceremony, Mayor of Bharatpur metropolis Renu Dahal said agriculture sector covering larger population of Nepal is the mainstay of Nepali economy. \"We are hopeful that the project would contribute to address the challenges of climate change, food security and sustainable agriculture development\". \nShe thanked the agronomists of AFU for their cooperation in carrying out scientific research and experimentation aimed at increasing rice production in Nepal. \nChinese Ambassador to Nepal Chen Song said the Nepal Southern Agricultural Science and Technology Park has been inaugurated under the China-South Asian Country Poverty Alleviation and Partnership Development Center. \nHe said the project is in line with the agreement reached between the leaders of China and Nepal during President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal in 2019. \n\"This project will be successful in promoting exchange and cooperation between the two countries in the areas of trade, livelihood improvement, youth exchange and other fields and taking bilateral relations to a new height,\" he noted. \nAmbassador Chen expressed his belief that the joint effort of Nepal and China would boost up the production of paddy in Nepal in next five years.Â \n"},{"hash":"a8e09259e68c6850fbd5c5f7794cb3b9b6a12617ae86e28aa0917a62c76b5e32","title":"myagdi-folks-worry-over-fading-tradition-of-deusi-bhailo","date":1730419200000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/entertainment-and-lifestyle/myagdi-folks-worry-over-fading-tradition-of-deusi-bhailo","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/deusii1730464536_1024.PNG","category":"entertainment-and-lifestyle","content":"\n    Santosh GautamMYAGDI: The otherwise vibrant festive atmosphere in major markets including Beni bazaar of the district eluded bustle now- with only two groups performing Deusi-Bhailo during the ongoing Tihar festival.\nLocal residents and shopkeepers have witnessed a notable decline in the number of groups performing the traditional cultural dance and songs, thereby drawing concern over the diminishing tradition.\nKiran Karki, a local entrepreneur at Indrenichowk of Beni district, lamented the absence of traditional charm in the market during the festival of lights and flowers.\nEarlier, there used to be at least 10 troupes of Deusi-Bhailo celebrants performing dances and songs.

The latest instance of this is Chairman of CPN (Maoist Centre) Pushpa Kamal Dahal raising the possibility of the current government pushing for Nepal to join the State Partnership Programme (SPP) proposed by the US government. Based on a media report that no other Maoist leader has seen, Dahal expressed his worry that Prime Minister Oli, who had earlier shown tentative support for the controversial US programme, might now give it his stamp of approval.Speaking at a press conference in Hetauda on Sunday, the three-time prime minister said, âThere is something more concerning than the Millennium Challenge Compact [MCC]. It is called the SPP. It has been reported in the US media that the current prime minister has already given theoretical consent to the SPP, and the US government has also made it official. This is a matter of serious concern.ââThis government can compromise on national interest to hold on to power,â Dahal further accused. âTheoretical consent is a serious matter in itself. Now, they could soon reach an agreement.âThis is the second time Dahal has expressed concern over the Oli governmentâs possible endorsement of the SPP. Last month too, while addressing a rally organised by his party in Kathmandu on October 26, Dahal had suggested that the Oli government could move forward with the SPP, which was earlier rejected by the Sher Bahadur Deuba government in 2022 when Dahalâs party was a coalition partner.In addition to Dahal, senior vice chair of the Maoist Centre, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, addressing the same rally, had also raised concerns that the Oli government might have already given its nod to the SPP.When the Post asked Shrestha after the rally about the SPP, he said that although they had no concrete evidence, there were enough clues to worry.âI have heard that American media is reporting about the agreement between the two countries regarding the SPP, but I donât have any concrete evidence to provide,â Shrestha, who served as foreign minister in the immediate past government, told the Post. When Maoist Centre spokesperson Agni Sapkota, the partyâs vice chair, was asked about the claims regarding the SPP made by the two leaders of his party, Sapkota told the Post, âI have heard news about Nepal joining the SPP in American media; however, I also need to figure out on what basis the party's leadership is making such a claim.âThe Post could get no convincing answer when it pressed these Maoist leaders to cite the concerned US media report that had allegedly published the piece on the SPP. Vijay Kant Karna, a foreign policy expert who had previously served as Nepalâs ambassador to Denmark on the Maoist Centre quota, says there is no chance that the present government will move forward with the SPP, as the previous government had rejected it. However, Karna says there would be no harm even if the government joined the SPP.âThe SPP is all about involving army personnel in disaster management. We have seen how ill-equipped and unprepared our state agencies were during the monsoon havoc in September,â Karna told the Post. âAlthough the SPP is needed for disaster management in our country, I donât think the present government would take it forward, unlike what the Maoist Centre leaders say.â Karna further says that Dahal, the leader of the main opposition party in the House of Representatives, has the right to seek a briefing from the secretary of the ministry concerned. âIf the Maoist party has certain information about it, why havenât they requested a briefing on the issue?â Officials at the foreign ministry also deny such a possibility. âThe previous government already has made it clear that Nepal will not be part of the SPP, so there is no chance of the country being a part of it even now,â an official told the Post. âIt is astonishing why the former prime minister has repeatedly claimed such developments.â Foreign policy experts say there is a competition among Nepali political parties to be close to foreign power centres, which may explain the latest statements by the leaders of the Maoist Centre. Yubraj Sangraula, a former attorney general and a staunch critic of the MCC Compact, also dismisses the possibility of the SPP gaining momentum. âThis could be no more than a political stunt by the Maoist Centre.â Sangurala told the Post.âHad there been any progress on this, it would have come to light through various means,â Sangurala claimed. However, one of Dahalâs foreign policy advisers during his time as prime minister argued that the Maoist chiefâs statement on the SPP can be understood in two contexts. âFirst, Nepal had requested the US to include it in the SPP in 2015 when Oli was prime minister. Second, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana has been extensively engaging with the Americans,â the former adviser, who tried to defend Dahalâs public statement, told the Post. However, leaders of the Congress and UML, the coalition partners, dismiss the Maoist claims.Even though Nepal had been writing to the US about participating in the SPP since 2015, it became a partner country in the SPP only in 2019. After the earthquake in 2015, Nepal had written to the US requesting participation in SPP for disaster management and humanitarian aid. Nepal wrote another letter in 2017 requesting the same. The US included Nepal as a participant in the SPP in 2019 only after the promulgation of the Indo-Pacific Strategy put forward by US President Donald Trump. However, there was no memorandum of understanding on it. When the US decided to include Nepal as an SPP member, Dahal, along with Oli, was co-chair of the Nepal Communist Party. This party was formed from a merger between the UML and Maoist Centre following the 2017 election, and the government was under their leadership. The issue of SPP first flared up in Nepal when the Commanding General of the US Army Pacific, Charles Flynn, during his Nepal visit in June 2022, urged Nepal to be a part of the SPP during his meeting with then Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and the former Army chief, General Prahnu Ram Sharma. Reportedly, the Deuba government also considered participating. Nepalâs âparticipationâ in the SPP had become a hotly debated political issue, with political parties engaged in an acrimonious blame game. Prime Minister Deuba was put under pressure by the then main opposition, UML, and his own party, Congress, to terminate Nepalâs partnership with the SPP. After controversy erupted over Nepal's partnership in the SPP, the US embassy in Kathmandu also issued a press note saying that Nepal can terminate its participation in the SPP if it wishes to. Later, on June 20, 2022, a Cabinet decision terminated its participation in the SPP. The SPP is administered by the National Guard Bureau, guided by State Department foreign policy goals, and executed by each US stateâs senior military officer to support the Department of Defense policy goals. âThrough SPP, the National Guard conducts military-to-military engagements in support of defense security goals but also leverages whole-of-security relationships and capabilities to facilitate broader interagency and corollary engagements spanning military, government, economic, and social spheres,â the US National Guard website reads.Â  ","summary":"Since the insurgency days, the Maoists have always been high on conspiracy theories, particularly when it comes to the United States, the superpower they once called an âimperialistâ force. The latest instance of this is Chairman of CPN (Maoist Centre) Pushpa Kamal Dahal raising the possibility of the current government pushing for Nepal to join the State Partnership Programme (SPP) proposed by the US government. Based on a media report that no other Maoist leader has seen, Dahal expressed his worry that Prime Minister Oli, who had earlier shown tentative support for the controversial US programme, might now give it his stamp of approval.Speaking at a press conference in Hetauda on Sunday, the three-time prime minister said, âThere is something more concerning than the Millennium Challenge Compact [MCC]. It is called the SPP. It has been reported in the US media that the current prime minister has already given theoretical consent to the SPP, and the US government has also made it official. This is a matter of serious concern.ââThis government can compromise on national interest to hold on to power,â Dahal further accused. âTheoretical consent is a serious matter in itself. Now, they could soon reach an agreement.âThis is the second time Dahal has expressed concern over the Oli governmentâs possible endorsement of the SPP. Last month too, while addressing a rally organised by his party in Kathmandu on October 26, Dahal had suggested that the Oli government could move forward with the SPP, which was earlier rejected by the Sher Bahadur Deuba government in 2022 when Dahalâs party was a coalition partner.In addition to Dahal, senior vice chair of the Maoist Centre, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, addressing the same rally, had also raised concerns that the Oli government might have already given its nod to the SPP.When the Post asked Shrestha after the rally about the SPP, he said that although they had no concrete evidence, there were enough clues to worry.âI have heard that American media is reporting about the agreement between the two countries regarding the SPP, but I donât have any concrete evidence to provide,â Shrestha, who served as foreign minister in the immediate past government, told the Post. When Maoist Centre spokesperson Agni Sapkota, the partyâs vice chair, was asked about the claims regarding the SPP made by the two leaders of his party, Sapkota told the Post, âI have heard news about Nepal joining the SPP in American media; however, I also need to figure out on what basis the party's leadership is making such a claim.âThe Post could get no convincing answer when it pressed these Maoist leaders to cite the concerned US media report that had allegedly published the piece on the SPP. Vijay Kant Karna, a foreign policy expert who had previously served as Nepalâs ambassador to Denmark on the Maoist Centre quota, says there is no chance that the present government will move forward with the SPP, as the previous government had rejected it. However, Karna says there would be no harm even if the government joined the SPP.âThe SPP is all about involving army personnel in disaster management. We have seen how ill-equipped and unprepared our state agencies were during the monsoon havoc in September,â Karna told the Post. âAlthough the SPP is needed for disaster management in our country, I donât think the present government would take it forward, unlike what the Maoist Centre leaders say.â Karna further says that Dahal, the leader of the main opposition party in the House of Representatives, has the right to seek a briefing from the secretary of the ministry concerned. âIf the Maoist party has certain information about it, why havenât they requested a briefing on the issue?â Officials at the foreign ministry also deny such a possibility. âThe previous government already has made it clear that Nepal will not be part of the SPP, so there is no chance of the country being a part of it even now,â an official told the Post. âIt is astonishing why the former prime minister has repeatedly claimed such developments.â Foreign policy experts say there is a competition among Nepali political parties to be close to foreign power centres, which may explain the latest statements by the leaders of the Maoist Centre. Yubraj Sangraula, a former attorney general and a staunch critic of the MCC Compact, also dismisses the possibility of the SPP gaining momentum. âThis could be no more than a political stunt by the Maoist Centre.â Sangurala told the Post.âHad there been any progress on this, it would have come to light through various means,â Sangurala claimed. However, one of Dahalâs foreign policy advisers during his time as prime minister argued that the Maoist chiefâs statement on the SPP can be understood in two contexts. âFirst, Nepal had requested the US to include it in the SPP in 2015 when Oli was prime minister. Second, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana has been extensively engaging with the Americans,â the former adviser, who tried to defend Dahalâs public statement, told the Post. However, leaders of the Congress and UML, the coalition partners, dismiss the Maoist claims.Even though Nepal had been writing to the US about participating in the SPP since 2015, it became a partner country in the SPP only in 2019. After the earthquake in 2015, Nepal had written to the US requesting participation in SPP for disaster management and humanitarian aid. Nepal wrote another letter in 2017 requesting the same. The US included Nepal as a participant in the SPP in 2019 only after the promulgation of the Indo-Pacific Strategy put forward by US President Donald Trump. However, there was no memorandum of understanding on it. When the US decided to include Nepal as an SPP member, Dahal, along with Oli, was co-chair of the Nepal Communist Party. This party was formed from a merger between the UML and Maoist Centre following the 2017 election, and the government was under their leadership. The issue of SPP first flared up in Nepal when the Commanding General of the US Army Pacific, Charles Flynn, during his Nepal visit in June 2022, urged Nepal to be a part of the SPP during his meeting with then Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and the former Army chief, General Prahnu Ram Sharma.

How can India stop the import of goods with Chinese components when even Indian manufacturersâbe they pharmaceutical companies or steel plantsâwould come to a halt without the import of raw material from China?

Not only did they know their candidate and what his presidency meant, but they also seemed to want more of the man who was convicted. The most impressive democracy chose a man who was charged with conspiring against the rights of the citizens. As The New York Times rightly wrote on Friday, post-election, âhe is not a fluke who somehow sneaked into the White House in a quirky, one-off electoral college win eight years ago.â A burning question that comes to mind, therefore, is: If a country that was seen as a viable template of liberal democracy and a superpower committed to the world has elected a felon, is liberal democracy a misnomer?Although writing off liberal democracy is a bit too early, one canât help but think about the United Statesâ unique system in which economic liberalism collaborates with a two-party model and how, over the years, it has eroded the essence of democracyâmainly by denying political choices and options to the American electorate. In addition, it has increased the influence of the wealthy one percent by allowing them to fund and thereby control political parties and elections. When the Greeks started the idea of democracy, they envisioned a rule of the people where people had the power to govern themselves and where the people themselves mandated political decisions. The American system is increasingly becoming a prisoner of a syndicate that has been controlling the political and economic landscapes of the US for quite some time now. The growing hyper-partisan polarisation that divides the country, even if mostly around election periods, cannot be good for its democratic well-being. After elections, the country painfully goes through several bouts of political gridlocks as partisan interests preside over the common good, making it difficult for the government to pass legislation. Once the hallmark of American democracy, political checks and balances have considerably weakened under the two-party model as partisan interests have overshadowed them.For many, voting has receded to âcrude signalsâ, and voting for a third party is a wasted protest vote. In addition, election manipulation and executive overreach are two growing problems in the American system that have been cited in several political literature lately. They explicitly explain how the system instituted laws to reduce votersâ access to the ballot, politicise election administration and control electoral competition through extreme gerrymandering. For a long time, the two-party model was justified by the âmedian voter theoryâ, according to which, in a two-party system, both parties tend to converge in the middle to appeal to the median voter, which would then maintain political moderation deemed crucial for any liberal democratic polity. This election seems to have falsified this theory because Trumpâs stance was anything but moderate. Likewise, news channels are increasingly talking about how the Democratic Party was rebuked for ignoring the suffering in Gaza, which The New York Times called âthis eraâs most progressive causeâ. The Democratic Party seems to have missed the median voterâs psyche in this election. In a country where the executive power has grown significantly, threatening civil service independence and judicial oversight, Trumpâs victory is worrisome. Moving on to American liberalism, a 2019 book by Branko Milanovic called it a âLiberal meritocratic capitalismâ where the rich tend to earn higher returns on their assets than the less wealthy, which they pass on to their offspring, resulting in a steep increase in inequality where social mobility decreases, and the wealthy increasingly exercise control over the state. Milanovic writes that âthose who own the most capital, attend the best schools, and thereby earn the most, begin to think of themselves as meriting their good fortune by virtue of their superior talents and ideasâ and not because of the capital that they hold which grants them access to impressive institutions and degrees. The book further states that the âreal source of the political influence of the wealthy is not that they have better ideas about how to organise a society, but that they have more to spend on acquiring power, therefore the influence of the rich comes from funding political parties and election campaigns.âSocial media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, and the popular newspaper The Washington Post, both owned by billionaire supporters of TrumpâElon Musk and Jeff Bezosâhelped shape the pre-election political psyche. The two-party system is easier for that one percent to influence and control as it limits representation and diversity. This, in turn, wards off the messiness of varied ideas and opinions and the instability that multi-party democracy typically brings.Our two largest political parties, the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress (NC) are enthusiastically propagating for the two-party model of late. If this continues unabated, Nepal is at the risk of becoming an oligarchy. Through the narrative of âbidhi ko shaashan,â autocratisation of the system can be easily achieved. As someone rightly said, âThe electoral road to the breakdown of democracy is dangerously deceptive.â Many times, governmentsâ efforts to subdue democracy are approved by the legislature and are therefore âlegalâ. Elected autocrats can maintain a faÃ§ade of democracy while parallelly eviscerating it, something that seems to be going on in India and, at times, even in Nepal.Democracy is a rational system dependent on rational voters. Rationality cannot be maintained without information. Uninformed voters can unwittingly vote for oligarchs through democracy. Likewise, uninformed legislators can vote for âreformsâ that mimic the first-world template of democracy without realising what is at stake. According to Freedom House, the US's democracy score is the lowest among developed democracies. Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and France boast higher scores than the US. This is something that needs to be factored into the conversations on political reforms.

This inquisition has an element of sarcasm: Are we not sensitive enough about world events? However, the main concern is about the silence of the Nepalis or the Nepali press on the colossal suffering of men, women and children caused by indiscriminate bombings and shootings that are reported every day. Given that the scale of suffering and physical assaults has surpassed all known limits, this concern is natural. âThe scenes may be disturbingâ has become the common warning of news anchors, a constant admonition of the apocalypse, as it were. It seems we live in a time when visuals of disaster jostle to take space in our system of understanding the world. Among the horrific events that are common are the wars and killings in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan, to name a few. Besides these, more incidents are happening that assail our sensibilities. The common pattern of suffering and atrocities is uncanny. Lethal bombs fall on peaceful cities and suburbs, hospitals and schools. Never before have such insensitivities showing children crawling out of the rubble, crying in horror and women mourning their dear ones, been reported or recorded as today. I recall one literary event organised by the institution of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) literary writers, held from December 3-6, 2023, in Delhi. The theme of the conference was âAnguish over Senseless Wars.â I want to cite from my article, published in this newspaper under the title of the above-mentioned theme, about the writersâ protest against war: âThe anguish felt by the writers about wars, especially the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Gaza wars, truly reflect literary writersâ concern. Non-partisan humanists, creators and advocates of peace and welfare, the writers get hurt more than the others by the colossal loss of lives, including children, in these and other senseless wars. All artists are touched by wars that are truly senseless. There are many instances of writersâ opposition to the wars. But they have paid heavily for such gestures. There is a history of banning books written against wars and other atrocities. In several places today, the voices of writers are drowned; they are even persecuted.â (The Kathmandu Post, December 24, 2023). The general complaint is that Nepali response to world events is not commonly featured in our media, nor does it occupy a space of importance in serious academic discussions. Maybe we must first look at our response to wars and atrocities in history. The Nepali youths, perhaps more than many others in Asia, have encountered and experienced the effects of world events, including wars, with personal involvement, physical loss of lives, and suffering. Researchers have discovered the songs composed by these youths who fought in the First World War as British soldiers. As an example, I would like to mention the research works of Alaka Atreya Chudal, a Vienna University teacher. Several such works record the experience of the Nepali youths who fought in the Second World War. That spectre of history continues to haunt and attract the Nepali youths today. I have no space to mention them here. What it shows is that the Nepali response to world events in history had a subjective and existential character. This subject needs a different treatment. Experiencing the effect of world events differs from looking at the incidents and making objective assessments. But it is natural for us to question today or at any other time about the scanty response to the current horrid events in our political expressions and the media. One Nepali youth, Bipin Joshi, was kidnapped by Hamas in the October 7 attack last year. The complaint is that the killings of civilians in the punitive attacks are not sufficiently reported and that people have not expressed their views on the events. But my impression is that we have responded well to these events. Nepali print and visual media are reporting the events regularly. The other quality of the world events is their diffused and confusing nature. Over the years, the events around the world did not have any recognisable nature. Covid-19 was a crisis that evoked the diverse responses of various world leaders, and the problems became serious after that. World events have had devastating effects on people's minds. In the words of Gordon Brown, Britain's former prime minister, âThe world is on fire. At no time since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 has the world looked so dangerous, nor has an end to its 56 conflictsâthe highest number since the Second World Warâseemed so distant and so difficult to achieve.\" (The Guardian, April 12, 2024). That remoteness and staggering number of events make it difficult for any media or individuals in Nepal to respond to the events. Our response is politically and emotionally oriented, a recognisable pattern in the world today. But the conditions that generate world events go beyond the control of those responsible for them. The rise of certain individuals to power with global effects and the temptation to invade othersâ territories and kill innocent people indiscriminately appear to shape the patterns of current events. Nepalis who have their own way of dealing with the world do respond. Their expression is shaped by their political ideologies or sheer humanitarian concerns. And that is happening. There is no space to cite examples here. It is natural for the media to allude to this subject and be surprised at Nepali mediaâs sparse response to peopleâs sufferings in all the âsenseless warsâ. We can question the causes of such a limited response to the terrible suffering of people in the wars. One reason is the emergence of a very boisterous and acrimonious political culture in Nepal, with political groups, media and the public spending most of their time on it. I would not call it solipsism, but this is certainly a subject of concern. Developing a comprehensive vision is the answer.Â  ","summary":"Some serious newspapers have raised a crucial question recentlyâwhy is the Nepali response to the current atrocities of war so scant? This inquisition has an element of sarcasm: Are we not sensitive enough about world events? However, the main concern is about the silence of the Nepalis or the Nepali press on the colossal suffering of men, women and children caused by indiscriminate bombings and shootings that are reported every day. Given that the scale of suffering and physical assaults has surpassed all known limits, this concern is natural. âThe scenes may be disturbingâ has become the common warning of news anchors, a constant admonition of the apocalypse, as it were. It seems we live in a time when visuals of disaster jostle to take space in our system of understanding the world. Among the horrific events that are common are the wars and killings in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan, to name a few. Besides these, more incidents are happening that assail our sensibilities.

Donald Trump has been elected the 47th President of the United States. If his victory in 2016 was more than just a fluke, it is convincing and comprehensive this time. This is what the common Americans want, and the rest of the world will have to live with it, just like the supporters of his Demoractic rival, Kamala Harris, who are still in shock.We can discuss what Trumpâs re-election means for the rest of the world and this region, but let us first take a longer detour to understand what is brewing inside the worldâs largest democracy.American nightmareIn the first week of March 2024, The New York Times published a report based on their telephone survey of around 980 registered voters, where they interviewed each participant about their perception of the two US presidential candidates. The survey, conducted in collaboration with Siena College in New York, showed that Trump had the support of 44 percent of the prospective voters, compared to 38 percent who favoured then-Democratic candidate Joe Biden. The survey results were significant, considering Trump's exit in 2020 as one of the most disliked presidents in US history, with multiple criminal charges against him. More significantly, only a quarter of the respondents thought the country was on the right track, and around 50 percent believed that the Biden administrationâs policies had personally hurt them. A few weeks before the polls, the survey team returned to the seven states, known as the battleground states, to understand the voting behaviour of roughly 7879 likely voters. Close to 90 percent of the participants were certain they would vote, but interestingly, 62 percent were undecided or refused to discuss their voting preference. The question then is, why were television channels and political pundits predicting Harrisâs victory when the data and survey polls were far from conclusive? The answer is a bitter pill that analysts and panellists, engaged in an unenviable job of predicting elections, have difficulty swallowing. The world is unfair, and people usually make choices that benefit them personally. From our own electoral experiences, in a developing or developed country, in a highly progressive democracy or a flawed one, we have learned the hard way not to take the voters for granted. Common votersâunlike a party worker, an academic or a self-styled activist, can be individualists who think only about what the candidate has to offer and how their policies affect their lives. They are not always burdened by the higher morals of society, nor are they too concerned about events that donât directly impact their lives. This is especially true if the voters believe their interests are being put at stake by their representatives in the name of a larger public good. This is at the heart of the majoritarian conservatism that is leading the world into a democratic back-sliding. For millions of people of colour, including Asian Americans, who migrated to the US in the 80s and the 90s, the American dream from Hollywood movies became a reality when the US government adopted a diversity policy to fulfil its skilled manpower needs. There is every reason to believe this policy boosted the US economy and projected the country as the land of democracy and dreams for minorities. But what did it do to the mindset of the majority of white Americans, including the working middle-class population? We do not know, do we? The nationalist rhetoric, often spewing hate against immigrants of different colour and races, did not gain strong support among a large section in a day or a decade. My own experience of writing and talking about the political inclusion of minorities has taught me spending too much time talking in an eco-chamber can blind-sight you from the reality unfolding right before your eyes. The sooner intellectuals and activists in the US understand this, the more they will be invested and interested in understanding the insecurities that have haunted their majority population. After all, the economic and environmental shocks the world has been facing since the last few decades have affected us all, irrespective of race, gender or ethnicity.The global aftershocks If Trumpâs re-election has sent shockwaves within the US, its aftershocks will be felt across different continents. His final months of the campaign focused on convincing the Americans that the Biden-Harris administration was bleeding the US economy by fighting proxy wars and that he would get both Putin and Netanyahu to end the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. It will take more than two months for Trump to assume office at the White House and another month for his administration to be in order. Any chances of direct talks with Russia and Israel, if at all, are a few months away. In the Indo-Pacific region, Trump will most likely continue on the course set by the previous administration. Given the global economic crisis that has had far-reaching consequences for both the Chinese and the American economies, Beijing and Washington have agreed to a gradual de-escalation in the Indo-Pacific. Any radical departure from this course will hurt both superpowers and push the global economy into another meltdown. The de-escalation between the nuclear powers will also benefit smaller South Asian states caught in a difficult big-power rivalry. A parallel development in this regard is the USâs relationship with India, which has been strained by the alleged involvement of Indian diplomats in espionage and attempted assassination on US soil. Similar allegations by Canada have resulted in a severe diplomatic fallout with New Delhi. It is unclear how the incoming Trump administration will react to these developments, especially when there is pre-existing discontent over New Delhiâs close ties with the Russians while continuing its security alliance with the US in the Indo-Pacific. If the recent Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) summit in Russia is of any consequence, Washington will need more than just a fleeting interest in the region to fix things with New Delhi. But is Trump ready to ride the high tides in the Indo-Pacific just yet? The president of the US is the worldâs most powerful executive, commanding the largest economy and military. So, Trump's re-election as president is one of the most significant political developments of this decade. While Trumpâs position concerning the climate crisis and human rights is deeply concerning, the global community will be more interested in his efforts to restore peace in war-ravaged Europe and the Middle East. On the domestic issues, however, we can only say: God bless America! ","summary":"The American fate has been sealed. Donald Trump has been elected the 47th President of the United States.

Thirty other people from nearby houses were wounded, PCHR said in a statement.Footage circulating on social media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed about a dozen bodies wrapped in blankets and laid on the ground outside a hospital near Jabalia. Local media said they were the bodies of people killed in the attack on the residential building, which housed at least 30 people, according to residents.The Israeli military said it struck a site in Jabalia in which âterrorists were operating.ââThese terrorists posed a threat to IDF (Israeli Defence Forces) troops operating in the area. The details are under review,â the Israel military said.In Gaza City, an Israeli airstrike on a house in the Sabra neighbourhood on Sunday killed Wael Al-Khour, an official at the welfare ministry, as well as his wife, Khour, one son, two daughters and three grandchildren, medical officials and relatives said.The Israeli military said it was looking into the report.The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said its teams, in collaboration with the International Committee of the Red Cross, evacuated 20 patients from Al-Awda Hospital in Jabalia on Sunday to another facility in Gaza City.It said one of the patients died as the ambulances were held up for hours at an Israeli checkpoint separating northern Gaza areas from Gaza City.The three hospitals in and around Jabalia have been besieged by Israeli forces for several weeks and hospital officials have refused army orders to evacuate the facilities or leave their patients unattended despite the depletion of food, medical and fuel supplies.The Israeli military accuses Palestinian militant group Hamas of exploiting the civilian population and property in Gaza for military purposes, a charge the militant group denies.Hamasâ armed wing said it killed 15 Israeli soldiers in an attack in the city of Beit Lahiya, north of Jabalia, on Sunday.There has been no comment from Israel and Reuters could not independently verify the account.The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service says its operations have been halted by an ongoing Israeli raid on two towns and a refugee camp in northern Gaza that began on Oct. 5.Israel says it sent forces since Oct. 5 into Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza to fight Hamas militants waging attacks from there and to prevent them from regrouping.

Thirty other people from nearby houses were wounded, PCHR said in a statement.Footage circulating on social media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed about a dozen bodies wrapped in blankets and laid on the ground outside a hospital near Jabalia. Local media said they were the bodies of people killed in the attack on the residential building, which housed at least 30 people, according to residents.The Israeli military said it struck a site in Jabalia in which âterrorists were operating.ââThese terrorists posed a threat to IDF (Israeli Defence Forces) troops operating in the area. The details are under review,â the Israel military said.In Gaza City, an Israeli airstrike on a house in the Sabra neighbourhood on Sunday killed Wael Al-Khour, an official at the welfare ministry, as well as his wife, Khour, one son, two daughters and three grandchildren, medical officials and relatives said.The Israeli military said it was looking into the report.The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said its teams, in collaboration with the International Committee of the Red Cross, evacuated 20 patients from Al-Awda Hospital in Jabalia on Sunday to another facility in Gaza City.It said one of the patients died as the ambulances were held up for hours at an Israeli checkpoint separating northern Gaza areas from Gaza City.The three hospitals in and around Jabalia have been besieged by Israeli forces for several weeks and hospital officials have refused army orders to evacuate the facilities or leave their patients unattended despite the depletion of food, medical and fuel supplies.The Israeli military accuses Palestinian militant group Hamas of exploiting the civilian population and property in Gaza for military purposes, a charge the militant group denies.Hamasâ armed wing said it killed 15 Israeli soldiers in an attack in the city of Beit Lahiya, north of Jabalia, on Sunday.There has been no comment from Israel and Reuters could not independently verify the account.The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service says its operations have been halted by an ongoing Israeli raid on two towns and a refugee camp in northern Gaza that began on Oct. 5.Israel says it sent forces since Oct. 5 into Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza to fight Hamas militants waging attacks from there and to prevent them from regrouping. It says its troops have killed hundreds of militants in those areas since the new offensive began.Efforts to reach a ceasefire between the two warring sides have failed so far, with Israel and Hamas trading blame.Qatar, which has been trying to negotiate a ceasefire along with Egypt and the United States, has told, opens new tab Hamas and Israel it will suspend its efforts until both sides show âwillingness and seriousnessâ to resume talks, its foreign ministry said on Saturday.There was no official response from Hamas or Israel.The war erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas gunmen attacked Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and seizing another 253 hostages, by Israeli tallies. Israelâs military campaign has levelled much of Gaza and killed around 43,500 Palestinians, Palestinian health officials say.

Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday. Trump has criticised the scale of US military and financial support for Kyiv, vowing to end the war quickly, without saying how.Ukraineâs foreign ministry said it was not informed in advance of the call between Trump and Putin and subsequently could neither endorse or object to it.âWe do not comment on private calls between President Trump and other world leaders,â said Steven Cheung, Trumpâs communications director, when asked about the phone call, which was first reported by The Washington Post.The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Republican Trump will take office on Jan. 20 after defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 presidential election. Biden has invited Trump to come to the Oval Office on Wednesday, the White House said.US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday that Bidenâs top message will be his commitment to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, and he will also talk to Trump about whatâs happening in Europe, in Asia and the Middle East.âPresident Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe,â Sullivan told CBS Newsâ âFace the Nationâ show.Sullivanâs comments came as Ukraine attacked Moscow on Sunday with at least 34 drones, the biggest drone strike on the Russian capital since the beginning of the war.When asked if Biden would ask Congress to pass legislation to authorize more funding for Ukraine, Sullivan deferred.âIâm not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal. President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for Ukraine beyond the end of his term,â Sullivan said.UKRAINE FUNDINGWashington has provided tens of billions of dollars worth of US military and economic aid to Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in February of 2022, funding that Trump has repeatedly criticized and rallied against with other Republican lawmakers.Trump insisted last year that Putin never would have invaded Ukraine if he had been in the White House at the time. He told Reuters Ukraine may have to cede territory to reach a peace agreement, something the Ukrainians reject and Biden has never suggested.Zelenskiy said on Thursday he was not aware of any details of Trumpâs plan to end the Ukraine war quickly and that he was convinced a rapid end would entail major concessions for Kyiv.According to the Government Accountability Office, Congress appropriated over $174 billion to Ukraine under Biden. The pace of the aid is almost sure to drop under Trump with Republicans set to take control of the US Senate with a 52-seat majority.Control of the US House of Representatives in the next Congress is not yet clear with some votes still being counted. Republicans have won 213 seats, according to Edison Research, just shy of the 218 needed for a majority. If Republicans win both chambers, it will mean the majority of Trumpâs agenda will have a significantly easier time passing through Congress.Republican US Senator Bill Hagerty, a Trump ally who is considered a top contender for secretary of state, criticized US funding for Ukraine in a CBS interview.âThe American people want sovereignty protected here in America before we spend our funds and resources protecting the sovereignty of another nation,â Hagerty said.The 2-1/2-year-old war in Ukraine is entering what some officials say could be its final act after Moscowâs forces advanced at the fastest pace since the early days of the war.Any fresh attempt to end the war is likely to involve peace talks of some kind, which have not been held since the early months of the war.Moscowâs forces occupy around a fifth of Ukraine. Russia says the war cannot end until its claimed annexations are recognized. Kyiv demands all of its territory back, a position that has largely been supported by Western allies.

Strengthening strategic ties between New Delhi and Washington and the evolution of Beijing-Washington ties are other factors to watch out, observers say.Former Foreign Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey said Nepalâs relations with the United States will remain unchanged irrespective of who enters the White Houseâa Republican or a Democrat.Nepal and the United States forged diplomatic relations on April 25, 1947, becoming only the second country to do so after the UK. Nepal established its embassy in Washington DC on February 3, 1958, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On August 6, 1959, the American Embassy in Kathmandu was set up. A number of Nepalâs honorary consuls are stationed in various US cities and a large number of Nepali nationals now live and work in the country.A Republican occupied the White House when Nepal and the US established diplomatic relations, said Pandey. Also, when Nepal opened its embassy in Washington DC and the US did so in Kathmandu, a Republican was at the helm. âWhen King Mahendra addressed the joint session of US Congress in 1960, a Republican president was in power. Later, when he travelled to the United States in 1967, a Democratic president governed the country. Then, when King Birendra paid a state visit to the US in 1983, there was a Republican president,â said Pandey. âThis suggests that the US policy towards Nepal has been stable and smooth.âThough Nepal-US relations have been changing for the better, during Trumpâs first presidency between January 20, 2017 and January 20, 2021, bilateral ties took a dip due to the controversy over accepting the Millennium Challenge Corporationâs $500 million grant.The MCC became controversial in Nepal and stirred up debates. After Washingtonâs repeated clarifications that MCC is not aligned with the USâs Indo-Pacific Strategy and introduction of the 12-point interpretive declaration, the US grant was ratified by the House of Representatives in February 2022. Nepal has also invested $197 million in the MCC projects.During Trumpâs first term as president, the American request for Nepal to join the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and State Partnership Program also caused unease in Nepal.

Nepal is looking for compensation for the damages from adverse effects of climate change, which is triggered mainly by the greenhouse gases emitted by large industrial countries.Nepal must tread carefully, said Pandey, especially with the US citizens electing a decisive president who wants no delays in action. Like Simkhada, former minister Pandey also believes that evolving ties between the US, India and China will shape Washingtonâs policy towards Kathmandu.Nepal is on the strategic radars of India, China and the US, said Pandey. âTherefore, it should be careful while navigating its relations with these three powers. Nepal should maintain healthy relations with both India and China.âNepal should not be tempted to use its ties with one neighbour against the other, Pandey added.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has yet to issue a congratulatory message on Trumpâs election but President Ramchandra Paudel and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli have congratulated the president-elect.In his congratulatory message on Wednesday, Paudel expressed confidence that the Nepal-US relationship would be further strengthened during Trumpâs second term.Prime Minister Oli on Thursday stated that Trumpâs return to the Oval Office is a historic chapter in American history.

Pyakurel called it a deliberate ârestrictionâ imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepalâs labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation bodyâs mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepalâs economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Officeâs annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.âItâs an unplanned construction,â said Pyakurel. âToday, time is money.

Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runwayâs southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengersâ4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movementsâ31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).âThese will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season.

As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the âconditionâ that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the âpunitive measureâ was not the aviation regulatorâs first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlinesâ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlinesâ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.âI would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31.

According to multiple leaders privy to the development, by electing a Congress lawmaker as deputy speaker, Oli wanted to strengthen relations with the major coalition partner Congress, which has more seats than the prime ministerâs party, the CPN-UML, in the House of Representatives. Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba has a special interest in getting a lawmaker from his party elected to the post, as deputy speaker is an ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council, which nominates members and heads of constitutional bodies.The prime minister on September 9 convened a meeting of the ruling parties and floated a proposal to remove Deputy Speaker Magar and sought a green signal from the coalition partners to his plan.After the meeting, party leaders told the Post that Prime Minister Oli proposed removing Deputy Speaker Magar from her position, citing conduct unbecoming of her office. Deputy Speaker Magar courted controversy after it emerged that she had requested visa interview dates from the US Embassy for individuals unrelated to her official role. On February 26 last year, Magar wrote to the US Embassy in Kathmandu requesting a visa interview for herself and five others. Two months later, the letter was leaked, and she was under pressure to step down.Last month, the prime minister held several meetings and consultations with a plan to introduce an ordinance to amend the Political Parties Act-2017 with an intention to facilitate party splits. This plan also drew widespread criticism as leaders from various political parties and independent observers accused the prime minister of plotting splits of fringe political parties with a plan to merge their dissident groups into the UML.His proposal to introduce ordinance was reportedly floated in order to merge the Ashok-Rai led Janata Socialist Party and the dissident group from the Madhav Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist), which in turn would make the UML the largest party in the House of Representatives.As the major coalition partner, the Congress, reportedly did not back his proposal to introduce the ordinance, Oli was again pushed to the back seat.These are just a few cases in point. Oli from the start of this tenure has struggled to assert his authority.Professor of political science Krishna Pokharel assesses that there may have been an understanding between Congress President Deuba and Prime Minister Oli to arrest Rastriya Swatantra Party President Rabi Lamichhane, who was accused of misappropriating cooperative funds, and issuing an ordinance related to political parties.Pokharel believes that the two leaders might have reached a deal to accomplish the two goalsâbring an ordinance to facilitate the split of the CPN (Unified Socialist), which was formed in 2021 after breaking away from the UML; and arrest Lamichhane. Lamichhane, the immediate past home minister, had reportedly tried to arrest Congress chief Deubaâs spouse (current foreign minister) Arzu Rana Deuba, on charges of involvement in the Bhutanese refugee scam. âWhile the wish of the Congress chief was fulfilled, the interest of the UML chair and the prime minister was not,â Pokharel said. However, the UML leaders donât buy this argument. Vice-chair Yubaraj Gyawali said that the government under UML leadership has just completed its 100 days, so it is too early to judge its performance. âThere are many good initiatives taken by this government whose results will come in due course,â Gyawali told the Post. âEverything that the head of the government wants cannot be achieved in such a short period, but that does not mean his influence has waned.â But some political analysts say that Oliâs standing has declined since he became prime minister this time with the support of Congress, the largest party in Parliament. Oli dismisses those who claim his influence has gone down. While addressing the symposium on âRole of former security personnel in National Security and Developmentâ organised by the Nepal National Former Army and Police Association on October 27, Oli rubbished claims that his influence was steadily decreasing.âThose who claim my charm has decreased will know the reality in the 2027 election,â Oli said.Sarita Bhusal, a UML lawmaker, said a mistaken impression might have been created among the people. âSometimes there are constraints to leading a coalition government,â Bhusal told the Post.Gyawali, a vice chair of the UML, agrees. âEarlier, Oli became prime minister with the support of smaller parties. But this time, he has the backing of the largest party in Parliament, so it is not easy for him to do all that he wants.â Oli first headed a coalition government after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. When he became prime minister again in 2018 after the 2017 election, his party was the largest in the House. He became prime minister with the support of the Maoist Centre, which was his coalition partner during his previous stint as well.The Congress publicity department head, Min Bahadur Bishwakarma, said his party has been giving full support to the Oli government. âOur party has not opposed any government programme that is good for the country,â Bishwakarma told the Post. âWe only caution the government on issues that may cause public backlash.âThis government was formed in the spirit of a seven-point agreement between the two parties, and achieving those objectives must be its primary focus, Bishawakarma said. Of late, Oli has also faced criticism from within his party. Some UML leaders publicly opposed his recent decision to accept a donation from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of Bhatbhateni Supermarket, for the construction of the partyâs head office. Experts see it as a sign of his decreasing hold in the party organisation. Although partyâs standing committee member Binda Pandey and central committee member Ushakiran Timilsina protested against it publicly, other party leaders are also reportedly dissatisfied with Oliâs decision.Bhim Rawal, who contested the election for chair against Oli during the partyâs 10th general convention in Chitwan in November 2021, also criticised Oli for accepting the donation. Sidelined by Oli, Rawal is currently inactive in the party. Even leaders like Gokul Baskota, who used to be a staunch Oli supporter, couldnât back him on the deal with businessman Gurung.In an interview with Image television, Baskota said, âThe UML cannot accept Gurungâs donation and carry his old baggage.â On October 28, the Supreme Court issued an interlocutory interim order barring the ruling party, UML, from building any structure on the land donated by businessman Gurung. A single bench of Justice Sunil Kumar Pokharel said the UML-Gurung donation deal was illegal prima facie, putting Oli further on the defensive. ","summary":"Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is known for his supposed ability to implement decisions and accomplish the tasks he takes up even at the cost of becoming unpopular.But a series of events after he became prime minister in mid-July tells a different story.In the three and half months since he assumed office at Singha Durbar, the prime minister has been compelled to backtrack on a couple of his plans or postpone them.In the first week of September, Prime Minister Oli pushed a plan to remove Deputy Speaker Indira Rana Magar from the post and elect a lawmaker from the ruling Nepali Congress in her place. According to multiple leaders privy to the development, by electing a Congress lawmaker as deputy speaker, Oli wanted to strengthen relations with the major coalition partner Congress, which has more seats than the prime ministerâs party, the CPN-UML, in the House of Representatives. Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba has a special interest in getting a lawmaker from his party elected to the post, as deputy speaker is an ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council, which nominates members and heads of constitutional bodies.The prime minister on September 9 convened a meeting of the ruling parties and floated a proposal to remove Deputy Speaker Magar and sought a green signal from the coalition partners to his plan.After the meeting, party leaders told the Post that Prime Minister Oli proposed removing Deputy Speaker Magar from her position, citing conduct unbecoming of her office. Deputy Speaker Magar courted controversy after it emerged that she had requested visa interview dates from the US Embassy for individuals unrelated to her official role. On February 26 last year, Magar wrote to the US Embassy in Kathmandu requesting a visa interview for herself and five others. Two months later, the letter was leaked, and she was under pressure to step down.Last month, the prime minister held several meetings and consultations with a plan to introduce an ordinance to amend the Political Parties Act-2017 with an intention to facilitate party splits. This plan also drew widespread criticism as leaders from various political parties and independent observers accused the prime minister of plotting splits of fringe political parties with a plan to merge their dissident groups into the UML.His proposal to introduce ordinance was reportedly floated in order to merge the Ashok-Rai led Janata Socialist Party and the dissident group from the Madhav Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist), which in turn would make the UML the largest party in the House of Representatives.As the major coalition partner, the Congress, reportedly did not back his proposal to introduce the ordinance, Oli was again pushed to the back seat.These are just a few cases in point. Oli from the start of this tenure has struggled to assert his authority.Professor of political science Krishna Pokharel assesses that there may have been an understanding between Congress President Deuba and Prime Minister Oli to arrest Rastriya Swatantra Party President Rabi Lamichhane, who was accused of misappropriating cooperative funds, and issuing an ordinance related to political parties.Pokharel believes that the two leaders might have reached a deal to accomplish the two goalsâbring an ordinance to facilitate the split of the CPN (Unified Socialist), which was formed in 2021 after breaking away from the UML; and arrest Lamichhane. Lamichhane, the immediate past home minister, had reportedly tried to arrest Congress chief Deubaâs spouse (current foreign minister) Arzu Rana Deuba, on charges of involvement in the Bhutanese refugee scam. âWhile the wish of the Congress chief was fulfilled, the interest of the UML chair and the prime minister was not,â Pokharel said.

The programme commenced with a conversation between Bell and Aditya Adhikari, a former journalist and columnist for the Kathmandu Post. In his conversation with Bell, Adhikari said, âThe book explores the hills and mountains surrounding Kathmandu, offering much more than a travelogue. Bell has written about cultural history and the environment based on his research.â Having spent decades in Nepal, Bellâs new book blends travelogue with folklore, literature, art, and anthropology. It addresses topics like the impact of British Imperialists and external pressures on the environment.âThe book is divided into four sections, featuring my four different walks through the Himalayas, each during a different season,â said Bell. In the first section, Bell delves into the theme of migration, covering various issues such as the moving of the Gurkhali soldiers, labour migrations to the Middle East, and the migration of birds, animals, and fish. He also touches on the arrival of the first settlers in the hills, Rai mythologies, and the shamanic histories of the landscapes. Similarly, the second section of the book details his journey to Dolpo. Adhikari remarked that he enjoyed reading Bellâs description of landscapes. The writer, however, mentioned, âI did not want to get too much into the whimsical description of nature, which was kind of challenging for me.âThe final section documents Bellâs journey to Rara Lake, where he discusses the concept of wilderness. In his conversation with Adhikari, he said, âThe idea of taming the wilderness is seen to be projected into the Himalayan region, due to which people were expelled from their homes.â He gave the example of Rara Lake, where residents were displaced to transform the area into the national park it is today. âOn writing this book, I cast my net as far as it could reach because the subject of social issues is so expansive.â Bell mentioned that he relied on historian Mahesh Chandra Regmi's research and cited author Shanker Koirala as a reference from his work âKhaireni Ghatâ.

In a bid to assess its strength, the ruling party has decided to find out the political affiliation of each voter.The country's second-largest party will send its volunteers to each household to find out the political leanings of the members. âOur local cadres know who our sympathisers are and who is associated with other parties. The study aims to find out the political inclination of those whose affiliations are not known,â Bishal Bhattarai, a UML politburo member and member of the partyâs Organisation Department, told the Post. Such study has already started in local units where byelections are being held next month. The voting is taking place for 44 positions including mayors and chiefs of rural municipalities in 33 local units across the seven provinces on December 1. The seats had turned vacant due to deaths and resignations, and other reasons. The party plans to conduct the nationwide study for two months, from mid-February to mid-April next year. As per the schedule, the partyâs central office will receive the reports from the local level by the end of the current fiscal yearâmid-July.Party leaders claim the survey is for the partyâs internal purposes to evaluate its strengths. âBased on the report, the party will devise its strategy to strengthen its positions wherever it is weak. Such surveys are done in other countries as well,â Rajendra Gautam, publicity department chief of the party, told the Post.However, political experts donât think the matter is as simple as the UML is trying to project. Krishna Khanal, professor of political science, said in principle there is nothing wrong with conducting surveys to collect information to devise strategies to mobilise party. âHowever, in a country like ours where the governmentâs treatment of people often depends upon their party affiliation, the ruling party studying the common peopleâs political affiliation is a serious matter. It will not only intimidate ordinary people, but also raises concerns that state machinery could be misused to bring neutral voters into the UMLâs camp,â he told the Post.Some political analysts see this move as an intrusion into personal matters. Uddhab Pyakurel, who teaches political sociology at Kathmandu University, collecting information of individual party affiliation is not an acceptable act in democracy. âThe UML is trying to adopt a radical communist strategy. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) applied a similar strategy to remain in power for long,â he told the Post.Not just the radical communists but right wing forces in India too are embracing a similar strategy to turn election results in their favour. During every election, from the municipal to Lok Sabha, Indiaâs Bharatiya Janata Party appoints panna pramukhs (unit incharges), who are tasked with influencing voters at the household level.Every constituency is divided into blocks, with lists of voters from every 10 to 12 families. And a person called panna pramukh is assigned to pay special attention to the families of his/her designated area. Their job is to convince them to vote for the party. This strategy seems to have worked for the right-wing party, which won the elections for the third consecutive time in June. âIt is not surprising to see that extremists, no matter whether they are right wing or left wing, adopt similar strategies,â said Pyakurel. The UML, which has seen a decline in the number of its organised cadres, wants to increase their numbers to at least one million which hovers around half that figure at present. It believes it can devise policy to increase its vote base based on the survey results. In the 2022 general elections, the country had 17.79 million registered voters.Pyakurel, however, doesnât believe that the UMLâs initiative is going to benefit it hugely during the elections. If his claims are anything to go by, swing voters have a significant share in Nepal and no single strategy by the UML is likely to guarantee results in the next general elections. Nepal is the country where pre-poll surveys are illegal although they are practiced elsewhere in the world. However, there is no restriction on a ruling party gathering information on peopleâs political affiliations. âThe Election Commission must come forward to stop the UMLâs move,â said Khanal, the professor.The UML leaders, however, say there is no need to âmake a mountain out of a molehillâ. âThis is just the partyâs internal survey. We are sensitive enough to individual freedom and the right to privacy,â said Bhattarai. ","summary":"The next general elections are three years away, but political parties have already started devising strategies to secure victory.While all major parties are discussing âmission 84â (election year 2084 BS, or 2027 AD), the CPN-UML is ahead of others in formulating strategies as much as it plans to collect private information on individual voters. In a bid to assess its strength, the ruling party has decided to find out the political affiliation of each voter.The country's second-largest party will send its volunteers to each household to find out the political leanings of the members. âOur local cadres know who our sympathisers are and who is associated with other parties. The study aims to find out the political inclination of those whose affiliations are not known,â Bishal Bhattarai, a UML politburo member and member of the partyâs Organisation Department, told the Post. Such study has already started in local units where byelections are being held next month. The voting is taking place for 44 positions including mayors and chiefs of rural municipalities in 33 local units across the seven provinces on December 1. The seats had turned vacant due to deaths and resignations, and other reasons. The party plans to conduct the nationwide study for two months, from mid-February to mid-April next year. As per the schedule, the partyâs central office will receive the reports from the local level by the end of the current fiscal yearâmid-July.Party leaders claim the survey is for the partyâs internal purposes to evaluate its strengths. âBased on the report, the party will devise its strategy to strengthen its positions wherever it is weak. Such surveys are done in other countries as well,â Rajendra Gautam, publicity department chief of the party, told the Post.However, political experts donât think the matter is as simple as the UML is trying to project. Krishna Khanal, professor of political science, said in principle there is nothing wrong with conducting surveys to collect information to devise strategies to mobilise party. âHowever, in a country like ours where the governmentâs treatment of people often depends upon their party affiliation, the ruling party studying the common peopleâs political affiliation is a serious matter. It will not only intimidate ordinary people, but also raises concerns that state machinery could be misused to bring neutral voters into the UMLâs camp,â he told the Post.Some political analysts see this move as an intrusion into personal matters. Uddhab Pyakurel, who teaches political sociology at Kathmandu University, collecting information of individual party affiliation is not an acceptable act in democracy. âThe UML is trying to adopt a radical communist strategy. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) applied a similar strategy to remain in power for long,â he told the Post.Not just the radical communists but right wing forces in India too are embracing a similar strategy to turn election results in their favour. During every election, from the municipal to Lok Sabha, Indiaâs Bharatiya Janata Party appoints panna pramukhs (unit incharges), who are tasked with influencing voters at the household level.Every constituency is divided into blocks, with lists of voters from every 10 to 12 families. And a person called panna pramukh is assigned to pay special attention to the families of his/her designated area. Their job is to convince them to vote for the party. This strategy seems to have worked for the right-wing party, which won the elections for the third consecutive time in June. âIt is not surprising to see that extremists, no matter whether they are right wing or left wing, adopt similar strategies,â said Pyakurel. The UML, which has seen a decline in the number of its organised cadres, wants to increase their numbers to at least one million which hovers around half that figure at present. It believes it can devise policy to increase its vote base based on the survey results. In the 2022 general elections, the country had 17.79 million registered voters.Pyakurel, however, doesnât believe that the UMLâs initiative is going to benefit it hugely during the elections. If his claims are anything to go by, swing voters have a significant share in Nepal and no single strategy by the UML is likely to guarantee results in the next general elections. Nepal is the country where pre-poll surveys are illegal although they are practiced elsewhere in the world. However, there is no restriction on a ruling party gathering information on peopleâs political affiliations. âThe Election Commission must come forward to stop the UMLâs move,â said Khanal, the professor.The UML leaders, however, say there is no need to âmake a mountain out of a molehillâ. âThis is just the partyâs internal survey. We are sensitive enough to individual freedom and the right to privacy,â said Bhattarai.

Kathmandu experienced its highest rainfall on record, surpassing previous measurements set in 2002. The Tribhuvan International Airport station recorded 239.7 millimetres of rain, highlighting the intensity of the weather system affecting the region.More than 83 percent of the total economic losses were observed in the physical infrastructures, amounting to Rs38.92 billion.The report said that 41 roads and highways were damaged. The estimated cost of repairing and maintaining the roads and highway infrastructure is Rs27.98 billion. Blocked or damaged roads hinder transportation and supply chains, complicating relief efforts and economic recovery.In the hydropower sector, the damage to 26 facilities has caused an estimated loss of Rs30.18 billion. This loss has significantly hit energy supply, impacting residential and industrial consumers.Nepalâs electricity imports are likely to surge this winter due to the delay in the reconstruction of hydropower plants. The 456MW Upper Tamakoshi hydropower project, Nepalâs largest in operation, has failed to resume generation since late September. According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, 980MW of output has been interrupted.Similarly, damage to 446 telecommunication units has resulted in a loss of R152.30 million.The destruction of 1,678 federal and provincial water supply and sanitation systems has led to an estimated loss of Rs5.90 billion. The report said that the loss affects access to clean water and poses health risks, particularly in the wake of disasters that often exacerbate waterborne diseases.Forty-four bridges sustained damage, resulting in an estimated financial loss of Rs1.04 billion. The report said the damage severely hampers connectivity and affects transportation and logistics in the region.The social sector has experienced profound impacts, particularly in housing and settlements. As per initial reports, 5,996 houses were destroyed, while 13,049 were damaged. This destruction has displaced 10,807 families, impacting 16,243 individuals who are now living in public shelters and facing challenges in finding basic amenities, according to the report.Six infrastructures were fully destroyed in the health sector, and 43 health facilities were partially destroyed. This limits access to essential medical services during a critical time when health needs are heightened due to potential post-disaster health crises. The education sector has not been spared either, with six schools destroyed completely and 136 schools partially damaged, further disrupting education for countless children.There were 249 deaths and 178 injuries, and 18 persons are still missing, the report said. The highest number of fatalities have been reported in Dhading, followed by Kavre and Lalitpur districts. In terms of human impact, Bagmati reported the highest fatalities at 208, while Koshi saw 20 deaths. The report said over 17,000 individuals were rescued, and more than 14,800 police personnel were deployed across affected areas. The most extensive police operations were in Kathmandu Valley and several districts in the Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces. In the productive sector, agriculture and livestock incurred substantial losses. The assessment indicates that 65,380 hectares of agricultural land and 26,698 livestock have been affected, resulting in an estimated economic loss of Rs5.88 billion. The report said that the significant impact on agriculture threatens food security and farmers' livelihoods, who rely heavily on their land and livestock for income.Seven irrigation projects have been affected, leading to a loss of Rs1.35 billion. The destruction of irrigation infrastructure jeopardises crop yields and exacerbates the agricultural crisis after the disasters.This assessment underscores the vulnerabilities of the affected sectors and the importance of comprehensive disaster preparedness and resilience-building measures to mitigate future risks.Bagmati province reported the most extensive damage, with 424 houses destroyed and 743 impacted.Bagmati province reported the highest levels of destruction, with 4,414 houses fully destroyed and 7,157 partially destroyed, affecting more than 14,517 families and displacing 9,997 families. Kavrepalanchok district was particularly hit, with 3,121 houses fully destroyed and 5,749 partially destroyed.Â  ","summary":"The heavy rainfall in late September, which triggered floods and landslides in most parts of the country, caused a loss of Rs46.68 billion to Nepalâs economy, nearly three-fold more than the initial estimates.According to the preliminary loss and damage assessment report released by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority under the home ministry on Thursday, the floods and landslides from September 26 to 28 caused significant damage to the physical infrastructure sector, followed by the social and productive sectors.According to the report, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology reported that out of 222 rainfall measurement stations across Nepal, 77 recorded heavy rainfall, with some areas receiving over 200 millimetres in just 24 hours. Kathmandu experienced its highest rainfall on record, surpassing previous measurements set in 2002. The Tribhuvan International Airport station recorded 239.7 millimetres of rain, highlighting the intensity of the weather system affecting the region.More than 83 percent of the total economic losses were observed in the physical infrastructures, amounting to Rs38.92 billion.The report said that 41 roads and highways were damaged. The estimated cost of repairing and maintaining the roads and highway infrastructure is Rs27.98 billion. Blocked or damaged roads hinder transportation and supply chains, complicating relief efforts and economic recovery.In the hydropower sector, the damage to 26 facilities has caused an estimated loss of Rs30.18 billion. This loss has significantly hit energy supply, impacting residential and industrial consumers.Nepalâs electricity imports are likely to surge this winter due to the delay in the reconstruction of hydropower plants. The 456MW Upper Tamakoshi hydropower project, Nepalâs largest in operation, has failed to resume generation since late September. According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, 980MW of output has been interrupted.Similarly, damage to 446 telecommunication units has resulted in a loss of R152.30 million.The destruction of 1,678 federal and provincial water supply and sanitation systems has led to an estimated loss of Rs5.90 billion. The report said that the loss affects access to clean water and poses health risks, particularly in the wake of disasters that often exacerbate waterborne diseases.Forty-four bridges sustained damage, resulting in an estimated financial loss of Rs1.04 billion. The report said the damage severely hampers connectivity and affects transportation and logistics in the region.The social sector has experienced profound impacts, particularly in housing and settlements. As per initial reports, 5,996 houses were destroyed, while 13,049 were damaged. This destruction has displaced 10,807 families, impacting 16,243 individuals who are now living in public shelters and facing challenges in finding basic amenities, according to the report.Six infrastructures were fully destroyed in the health sector, and 43 health facilities were partially destroyed. This limits access to essential medical services during a critical time when health needs are heightened due to potential post-disaster health crises. The education sector has not been spared either, with six schools destroyed completely and 136 schools partially damaged, further disrupting education for countless children.There were 249 deaths and 178 injuries, and 18 persons are still missing, the report said. The highest number of fatalities have been reported in Dhading, followed by Kavre and Lalitpur districts. In terms of human impact, Bagmati reported the highest fatalities at 208, while Koshi saw 20 deaths. The report said over 17,000 individuals were rescued, and more than 14,800 police personnel were deployed across affected areas. The most extensive police operations were in Kathmandu Valley and several districts in the Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces. In the productive sector, agriculture and livestock incurred substantial losses. The assessment indicates that 65,380 hectares of agricultural land and 26,698 livestock have been affected, resulting in an estimated economic loss of Rs5.88 billion. The report said that the significant impact on agriculture threatens food security and farmers' livelihoods, who rely heavily on their land and livestock for income.Seven irrigation projects have been affected, leading to a loss of Rs1.35 billion.

Along with health workers serving at local bodies and provincial hospitals, elected representatives and local leaders of political parties, with whom they discussed, complained about exorbitant testing charges at private laboratories.âWe are aware of the excessive prices being charged by private labs for dengue testing and held discussions about setting a maximum price but couldn't reach a decision,â said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the division. âFor the next dengue season, we would make a decision about slashing the testing charges.âNepal has been witnessing a rapid surge in new cases of dengue infection in recent months. Health authorities, however, do not concede that the number of new dengue cases is rising alarmingly. Doctors say there could be dengue patients in almost all households, especially in the Kathmandu Valley and in major cities like Pokhara.Officials say that state-run health facilities do not charge for dengue testing, and they are aware of excessive charging by private labs despite the significant decline in the cost of rapid diagnostic test kits.âIt cost less than 100 rupees for a rapid diagnostic testing kit, but private labs have been charging excessively,â an official at the Department of Health Services said, asking not to be named, as he is not authorised to speak to the media. âDue to a lack of regulation, private labs and hospitals have been fleecing patients, and health officials have been avoiding making decisions to appease the private laboratories and hospitals.âPublic health experts say that it was obvious for patients to bear brunt when the authorities concerned, including the health minister, focus on gaining popularity by announcing populist programmes that are not feasible to implement with existing resources.âSome hospitals have been charging up to Rs 3,000 for dengue tests,â said Dr Baburam Marasini, a public health expert. âWhen the authorities forget their prime duties and fear antogonising private hospitals and labs, it is inevitable that patients will suffer.âMost state run health facilities and labs remained closed during Tihar holidays, which forced infected patients to seek services at private hospitals. Meanwhile, the Department of Health Services said that its attention has been drawn to the excessive charging for dengue testing at private labs.âI have noted the issue and will discuss it with the Health Ministry,â said Dr Bikash Devkota, director general at the Department of Health Services. âWe will make some decisions regarding this issue.âDengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.So far, only 12 people have died, and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often concealed the actual number of deaths and infections.As there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms, including platelet-rich plasma transfusion.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives. ","summary":"A team of senior health officials from the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, who were deployed recently in Gandaki Province to assess the latest situation of the dengue spread, returned with complaints. Along with health workers serving at local bodies and provincial hospitals, elected representatives and local leaders of political parties, with whom they discussed, complained about exorbitant testing charges at private laboratories.âWe are aware of the excessive prices being charged by private labs for dengue testing and held discussions about setting a maximum price but couldn't reach a decision,â said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the division. âFor the next dengue season, we would make a decision about slashing the testing charges.âNepal has been witnessing a rapid surge in new cases of dengue infection in recent months. Health authorities, however, do not concede that the number of new dengue cases is rising alarmingly.

Seeking help for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues is often a last resort.Seema Kumari Pasman, a 20-year-old from Karmahi village in Dhanusha who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy, is one such example.Married at 16 in 2019, she quickly became a mother of two children by 2022.After two child births, her menstrual complications worsened, yet she had no frame of reference to understand that what she was experiencingâmenorrhagia, or abnormally heavy bleedingâwas a medical condition.Pasman endured a year of painful, prolonged periods that she had been taught were simply part of a womanâs lifeâa burden, not a condition needing treatment.Daily chores became unbearable for her but those around her continued to dismiss her symptoms.One night in December 2023, after collapsing while fetching water from a hand pump, Pasmanâs family rushed her to Janakpur Provincial Hospital.There, doctors diagnosed her with severe anaemia from untreated menorrhagia. âThe doctors told me that if I had received earlier intervention, my suffering could have been prevented...but I only thought it was normal,â Pasman says.The culture of silence around SRH issues means that women like Pasman get help only when their conditions are critical.A 2018 study in the Journal of Health and Allied Sciences reported low awareness of SRH rights among 384 married Madheshi women in Sarlahi. Three-fifths were unaware of these rights, and the same proportion reported experiences of physical and dowry-related violence.Chandra Rekha Issar, a gynaecologist at Janakpur Provincial Hospital and assistant professor at the Madhesh Institute of Health Sciences (MIHS), says that for many women, the concept of openly talking about SRHâespecially with male doctorsâis almost unthinkable.In rural Madhesh, as part of âghunghat prathaâ, married women have limited interaction with unrelated men outside their family. They are often expected to wear a veil in front of everyone except their husbands and rarely go outside alone for extended periods.This restrictive environment creates a hesitation among women to discuss their SRH. When these women visit a gynaecologist and are assigned a male doctor, it often leads to discomfort.Health consultations can thus become uncomfortable or are avoided altogether, exacerbating a pattern of undiagnosed and untreated conditions.At Janakpur Hospital, this cultural barrier plays out every single day.Kamala Devi Mandal, a 30-year-old woman from Khariyani, Janakpur, sat clutching her veil in the waiting area of the Department of Gynaecology, with her mother in law on the side.When her turn came, Mandal hesitated upon seeing a male gynaecologist, Raj Kishor Pandit, at the door. Despite a female attendantâs presence, Mandalâs mother-in-law ultimately did the talking, while Kamala remained silent, visibly uncomfortable.For Issar, these hesitations are all too familiar. She works alongside male gynaecologists in a department where only four of the 13 doctors are female.âIn a setting where women are uncomfortable speaking about reproductive issues, especially with male doctors, we have to proceed carefully, often through the person accompanying the patient,â she says.Most of the female patients are accompanied by family members, as husbands are often working abroad.For something as basic as the date of their last menstrual cycle, the patient often defers to the person accompanying her. âMost of them are under a veil,â Issar added, âand removing it, even for an eye check to assess anaemia, takes coaxingâ¦ It requires long counselling for women to open up. At times, the information we receive is incomplete, which creates challenges in treatment.âIf patients still hesitate to see a male gynaecologist after counselling, a female gynaecologist is assigned when possible, says Issar. However, this is often unfeasible during busy hours due to limited staff compared to the high patient load.Gynecologist Issar says that about 85 percent of the hospitalâs gynaecology and obstetrics cases involve pregnancy-related complications, often worsened by malnutrition, lack of prenatal care, and early marriages.General gynaecology accounts for 15 percent of patients, with menstrual issues like dysmenorrhea and heavy bleeding common among adolescents under 19, while older patients face infections, cervical cancer, and uterine prolapse.Due to early marriages, multiple childbirths, and home deliveries without medical supervision, many women develop uterine prolapseâa condition typically seen in older women but increasingly common in those as young as 30 in rural Madhesh.The gendered expectations that govern interactions in rural Madhesh leave women ill-equipped to advocate for their health.âDuring a health camp in Saptari, I found that over ten percent of women under 35 had uterine prolapse,â Issar says. âEarly marriage and childbirth in an environment without health education or postnatal care have serious consequences.âThe barriers also include outdated beliefs and superstitions which affect womenâs diet and recovery after childbirth.âAlthough the situation has improved, women in remote Madhesh are often prohibited from consuming protein-rich foods like chicken soup or meat after giving birth,â says 24 year old Sapana Ray, a bachelorâs student in public health at Madhesh Institute of Health Sciences. âThey are typically allowed only one meal of roti and are discouraged from more water and meal, as itâs believed that this prevents colds and other illnesses in the child,â Ray added, âThis lack of nutrition contributes to malnutrition and anaemia, exacerbating their health issues.âWhen rural women lack basic health literacy, common gynaecological issues go unchecked, leading to preventable complications. For instance, over 80 percent of cases at Janakpur Provincial Hospital are critical.âMost of these severe cases could have been prevented with early intervention or just an understanding of basic health,â Issar says.As Issar sees it, comprehensive awareness campaigns are crucial for educating women about sexual and reproductive health.âThe government should consider monthly outreach programmes in rural areas. Women in far rural communities need direct, consistent health education,â Issar says. Further, local health posts with trained personnel could provide preventive care and answer questions women may hesitate to bring up in a hospital setting.The hospitalâs efforts to include female attendants in male doctorsâ consultations and to counsel women on gender-neutral healthcare only go so far. Often, patientsâ deep-seated fears and hesitation prove challenging to overcome.While Madheshâs women struggle with silence and a lack of resources, healthcare professionals are left piecing together fragmented stories, trying to heal patients who are often reluctant to share their suffering.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I donât know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allenâs bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didnât have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesnât release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just rightânot too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. Itâs crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the bakerâs repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards.

","summary":"I can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I donât know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allenâs bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didnât have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesnât release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just rightânot too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. Itâs crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the bakerâs repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessityâa space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an âoasisâ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. Itâs a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.âIn developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,â says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyoneâqueer and non-queer alikeâto share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.âI didnât want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,â Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikariâs identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. âAt first, I didnât understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,â Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding oneâs identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldnât afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.âDuring my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,â Adhikari says.âThe time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.âFour years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the cafÃ© because of its welcoming atmosphere.âItâs heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like âDahi Chiura Khane din,ââ she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. âI hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I donât think weâd have any other place to turn to,â she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, âThis is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesnât exist here. Itâs where even those who arenât accepted at home can feel accepted.âSahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmanduâs first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. âAs an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.âThe welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the cafÃ© and appreciates the importance of such spaces.âPreviously, I didnât know much about the queer community and didnât care much. But now, coming into this cafÃ©, Iâve been interested in their rights and issues. Iâve realised that weâre not so different after all. We are all human,â he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.âLike how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,â he says.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishraâs early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, âThe Sewing Tinâ, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Postâs Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. Itâs been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdainâs groundbreaking book, âKitchen Confidentialâ, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorousâit involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of âThe Sewing Tinâ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staffâeconomic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriersâI had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at âJunoonâ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant âThe Sewing Tinâ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.âThe Sewing Tinâ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing suppliesâsomething uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?Iâm on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But Iâm still learning and want to explore more of Nepalâs cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because itâs got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.Iâve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their foodâitâs like theyâre sharing a story. Theyâve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. Itâs okay to give helpful advice but donât be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldnât also just copy whatâs popular, they should cook what they truly love. Thatâs what makes food special and meaningful.Mishraâs signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve ","summary":"Aditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York.

The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdainâs groundbreaking book, âKitchen Confidentialâ, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorousâit involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of âThe Sewing Tinâ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staffâeconomic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriersâI had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at âJunoonâ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant âThe Sewing Tinâ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.âThe Sewing Tinâ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing suppliesâsomething uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?Iâm on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But Iâm still learning and want to explore more of Nepalâs cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because itâs got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.Iâve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their foodâitâs like theyâre sharing a story. Theyâve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. Itâs okay to give helpful advice but donât be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldnât also just copy whatâs popular, they should cook what they truly love. Thatâs what makes food special and meaningful.Mishraâs signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve "},{"hash":"4f18229de2a5d8016e8888758de34cc858e98af2b542ed3077fa8ab2d1e49a3b","title":"patience-passion-and-pastries","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/recipes/2024/04/27/patience-passion-and-pastries","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/BakeleusbyCeleus-1714186343.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1714176000000,"source":"kp","category":"recipes","content":"Celeus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense.

Yet, pockets of the past remainâsmall, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in todayâs Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hourâs walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokanaâs historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the âKhokana Museumâ. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the areaâs history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean waterâa practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.Â  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot âAbout Dry Grassesâ, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happeningâto what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say âlifeâs turning point?â How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.âHow much oxygen do you need for the summit?â sounds more like âHow much do you need to hold on to life?â How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, âIs this journey worth this much?âI had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my fatherâs memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered natureâs masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like âHow will I endure?â and âHow will I finish?â started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of âGodsâ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just thereâbefore and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled âMy Soul Beyond the Mountainâ.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. ","summary":"âHow much oxygen do you have for the summit?âI think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot âAbout Dry Grassesâ, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happeningâto what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say âlifeâs turning point?â How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.âHow much oxygen do you need for the summit?â sounds more like âHow much do you need to hold on to life?â How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, âIs this journey worth this much?âI had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my fatherâs memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered natureâs masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like âHow will I endure?â and âHow will I finish?â started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of âGodsâ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just thereâbefore and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colomboâs Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resortâs expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the islandâs famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lionâs Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. âThatâs a better figure now as we are recovering.âThe travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the UkraineâRussia war, and Chinaâs zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the countryâs GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the worldâs best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.âTourism is gaining momentum,â says Somasiri. âThe British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.âJanuary-August is the peak season for foreigners. âFrom December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,â says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, âDon't take selfies with your back to Buddha.â Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.âThese infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the countryâs dry zone,â says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrewâs, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lankaâs hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as âLittle Englandâ. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sitaâs whereabouts.In Ella, Ravanaâs waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasnât crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galleâs 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.âThe main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,â says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.âWe have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,â added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. âWe have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,â says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.âThe other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,â says Pathirana.

We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.âThe main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,â says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.âWe have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,â added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. âWe have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,â says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.âThe other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,â says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki MandirâJanaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earthâthe Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10Â°c to 20Â°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the worldâs third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the schoolâto quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. Itâs the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leaderâs birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidimâs lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldnât help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughterâsymbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution.

The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. âThere would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,â says the 51-year-old. âAnd you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.âClear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapaâs help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article âChangako Utpati Ra Bikasâ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that âsome have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.â Yet some others, he writes, state that kites âcame to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.âHe concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: âBut since Nepalâs relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.âIn Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that âDuring the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,â suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.âIn our times, it wasnât easy to fly kites,â he says. âWe had to prepare majha â¦And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].âThis preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.âThose were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,â says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. âFour to five of my kites were cut in a day,â writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article âChanga Jastai Udi Hidne Manâ published in Himalkhabar. â[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.âKites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.âMaterials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article âDashainko Butte Changaâ published in Gorkhapatra. âBecause this work couldnât be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didnât dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldnât be sunny, the entire planâ¦was aborted.âKite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. âWhen my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,â says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. âSo the shop must be around a hundred years old.âAnother shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls âa kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahilâ in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s â Bekhachaâs Shop at Netapacho, Bhaichaâs Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandharâs Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.âOne day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article âChangaâ in Sahitya Post. âI was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.âIn Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.âI went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,â he writes in the book. âSuch kites apparently sold well!âMost septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.âLucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,â says Tuladhar. âKites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.âThe kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours â Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha â in fact in all core settlements of the Valley â were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothersâ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.âBut more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.âWhen the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmanduâs joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiittttâ¦â¦â¦âThe greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,â writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article âCutting is the greatest funâ published in magazine Kite Lines. âWith its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.âNepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.âThe technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,â he writes. âThe Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.âAt any given time, like Bibekâs kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. âEven passersby stopped to look at the kites,â recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.ââOii leave that thread,â the kite owner would scold me. âWhy do you pull my thread, leave it right now.â But Iâd continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.âThe fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.âChildren ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,â says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.âLove and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. âJust as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,â he writes in the article. âSome wrote love letters using a few words in âsymbolic languageâ on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.âKing Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: âOnce or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the kingâs kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.âIn 2021 news report âBhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakashâ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that âDuring Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. [â¦] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.âIn the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.âOh, itâd be a lot of people,â says Shrestha. âThey came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.âThey flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.âThey took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,â says Tuladhar. âI remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.âJoshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.âThe event survived in some form until the 1990s,â he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.âIf I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, itâs not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,â says Tuladhar. âCityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.âDibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.âNo space to fly kites today,â he says. âIn the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.âYesteryearâs kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.âWhen television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,â says Bibek. âAnd then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.âAnd so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.âThose days we heard one chait after another,â she says. âThese days you wonât hear a single chait.â ","summary":"Chaaaiiitttâ¦The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. âThere would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,â says the 51-year-old. âAnd you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.âClear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapaâs help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article âChangako Utpati Ra Bikasâ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that âsome have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.â Yet some others, he writes, state that kites âcame to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.âHe concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: âBut since Nepalâs relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.âIn Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that âDuring the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,â suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.âIn our times, it wasnât easy to fly kites,â he says. âWe had to prepare majha â¦And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].âThis preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.âThose were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,â says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. âFour to five of my kites were cut in a day,â writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article âChanga Jastai Udi Hidne Manâ published in Himalkhabar. â[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.âKites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.âMaterials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article âDashainko Butte Changaâ published in Gorkhapatra. âBecause this work couldnât be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didnât dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldnât be sunny, the entire planâ¦was aborted.âKite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. âWhen my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,â says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. âSo the shop must be around a hundred years old.âAnother shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls âa kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahilâ in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s â Bekhachaâs Shop at Netapacho, Bhaichaâs Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandharâs Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.âOne day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article âChangaâ in Sahitya Post. âI was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.âIn Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.âI went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,â he writes in the book. âSuch kites apparently sold well!âMost septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century.

They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.âThe kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours â Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai.

She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nationâs divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelorâs degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, âNot having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.âOn March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. âThere are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,â he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the âKumari Gharâ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. âMatina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,â said Shakya. âThe kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,â he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. âThe traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,â he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or âgoddessesâ, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjanâs complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, âIf Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.âThe case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the countryâs President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjanâs petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.âPeople who donât understand the culture shouldnât comment on it,â she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. âPeople who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,â she said.âAfter the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,â she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.âThe only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,â said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. âKumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumariâs tuition time,â he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.âThe Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,â said Shakya, former Kumari Matinaâs father.âSome people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I donât believe it violates any of my childâs rights.âWhile the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. âShe enjoys this normal life and it didnât take her long to adjust as well,â says Matinaâs father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. ","summary":"In 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nationâs divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelorâs degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, âNot having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.âOn March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. âThere are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,â he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the âKumari Gharâ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. âMatina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,â said Shakya. âThe kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,â he added.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932â1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interestsâas a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimesâgambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?âI remember once seeing a small board that read âJawalakhel Zoological Gardenâ,â Koirala says. âI donât know whether it was from Juddhaâs time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.âKoirala adds, âThere is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddhaâs time.âBirds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepalâs rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepalâs royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book âSocial History of Nepalâ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapurâs King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipurâs King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained âtiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deerâ¦ heron, peacockâ¦ pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.âJung Bahadur Ranaâs zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to âsupervise and inspect itâ. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddhaâs biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in âThe Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Ranaâ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmanduâs Rana community including Juddhaâs descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, SchÃ¶nbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the worldâs first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddhaâs inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled âCentral zoo in state of neglectâ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day âreceived a pair of leopards as a giftâ, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report âCentral Zoo Master Planâ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals âincluding deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmanduâ could be put into one compound in the âlonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhariâ.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patanâs King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zooâs layoutâexcept for the small plots of lands acquired laterâthat was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddhaâs zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosuresâthe southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddhaâs zoo house?âWe cannot tell for sure,â Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.âIn those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,â Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monalâfrom the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddhaâs zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shresthaâs account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungleâs kingâcreatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as giftsâappearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsherâs âShree Teen Juddha Mahimaâ published during Juddhaâs reign in 1943.âOne need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,â he writes. âIt will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.âAmong these incredible creatures, one reigned supremeâlion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungleâs king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddhaâs zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.âWhere bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,â Koirala says. âThese were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.âNear these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddhaâs place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zooâs entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddhaâs elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumariâs enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumariâs statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumariâs statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhelâs most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.âOn June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbarâ¦ the pond nearby looked very scenic,â says a Gorkhapatra news report titled âStatue installationâ dated July 5, 1935. âBecause it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranathâ¦ and moreover since an ideal womanâs statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.âLess than fifty metres from Karma Kumariâs statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zooâs meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zooâs lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?âI think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,â Subodh Rana said. âIt is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.âFor one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one âneed not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countriesâ suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatarsâa neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lionâs roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world cameâcreatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each otherâs joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddhaâs Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddhaâs Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmanduâs Rana community including Juddhaâs descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, SchÃ¶nbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the worldâs first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddhaâs inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled âCentral zoo in state of neglectâ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day âreceived a pair of leopards as a giftâ, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report âCentral Zoo Master Planâ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals âincluding deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmanduâ could be put into one compound in the âlonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhariâ.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patanâs King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zooâs layoutâexcept for the small plots of lands acquired laterâthat was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddhaâs zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosuresâthe southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddhaâs zoo house?âWe cannot tell for sure,â Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.âIn those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,â Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monalâfrom the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddhaâs zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shresthaâs account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungleâs kingâcreatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as giftsâappearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsherâs âShree Teen Juddha Mahimaâ published during Juddhaâs reign in 1943.âOne need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,â he writes. âIt will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.âAmong these incredible creatures, one reigned supremeâlion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungleâs king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddhaâs zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.âWhere bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,â Koirala says. âThese were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.âNear these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddhaâs place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zooâs entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddhaâs elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumariâs enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumariâs statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumariâs statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhelâs most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.âOn June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbarâ¦ the pond nearby looked very scenic,â says a Gorkhapatra news report titled âStatue installationâ dated July 5, 1935. âBecause it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranathâ¦ and moreover since an ideal womanâs statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.âLess than fifty metres from Karma Kumariâs statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zooâs meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zooâs lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?âI think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,â Subodh Rana said. âIt is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.âFor one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one âneed not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countriesâ suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatarsâa neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lionâs roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world cameâcreatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each otherâs joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddhaâs Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddhaâs Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

Even now, 23 years later, those fires are proving difficult to extinguish. The so-called War on Terror (WoT), much like the Cold War, has been an expansive war, which has directly or indirectly affected almost every nation. It would, therefore, be of interest to examine their similarities and differences.The term âCold Warâ was first used by George Orwell, the nom de plume of Eric Arthur Blair, in an article in 1945. The war itself commenced with the announcement of the Truman Doctrine in 1947 and concluded with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The WoT started about 10 years later, in 2001. The withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in 2021 was celebrated as the end of the WoT. However, post-withdrawal developments proved that the WoT had merely entered a new phase. The US may have physically withdrawn from the theatre, but its strategic interests remained intact. Even today, the great powers and major terrorist groups do not know when the WoT will end.While the Cold War was between two blocs, with other states taking a side, the ongoing WoT was supposed to be between nation-states and violent non-state actors. In reality, some states did provide space, finances, and ideological and diplomatic support to violent non-state actors; otherwise, it would be difficult for the latter to survive.Therefore, though terrorist groups were also active during the Cold War, the post-9/11 era saw a mushroom growth in their numbers. Al Qaeda was established much before the WoT, but it spawned and inspired a number of extremist groups thereafter. The WoT not only impacted the sovereignty of states but also the territorial integrity of a few. Countries like Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, and Afghanistan faced instability and were confronted with civil war-like situations.The Cold War was primarily an ideological confrontation between capitalism and communism; the WoT was about combating terrorism based on a struggle against extremist ideologies. The Cold War and WoT both influenced international relations, with alliances shaping geopolitics. The Cold War saw Soviet expansion, with the capitalist bloc trying to contain it. For some analysts, the Cold War was a smokescreen for the US to influence and control events in Western Europe and Japan. On the other hand, the WoT remained largely focused on specific regions, particularly in the Middle East. The Cold War spawned a nuclear race and indirect military engagements, while the WoT saw direct and prolonged military engagements, as seen in Afghanistan and Iraq.To recognise its strategic partners in 1987, the US designated Major Non-Nato Ally (MNNA) status to various countries.MNNAs are not members of Nato but are entitled to certain benefits in military cooperation. Out of the 20 countries with MNNA status, eight received it before 9/11, while 12 countries obtained this status in the post-9/11 era. This highlights how the US grew its military influence around the world following the WoT.The WoT is not restricted to national borders and involves many countries and international coalitions. The WoT often involves state actors combating non-state actors and has therefore influenced security legislation and policies such as the USâs Patriot Act, which extended surveillance and law-enforcement powers within the worldâs most powerful nation as well. The WoT also brouÂ­ght with it human rights concerns, esÂ­Â­peÂ­cially about tortuÂ­Â­re, detentions (for example, GuanÂ­tÃ¡Â­namo Bay) and targeted killings via drones.During the initial phase of the WoT, religious extÂ­remism, ethnic diÂ­Â­vides, and political marginalisaÂ­Â­t-ion furÂ­ther comp-licaÂ­tÂ­Â­ed the militÂ­aÂ­ncy laÂ­Â­ndscape. The WoT gained impetus from globalisatÂ­ion, technological innovations, the openness of media and the strenÂ­gth of social media, which triggered rights and peace movements on the one hand, while enabling the speedy dissemination of hate material and fake news on the other.States with weak economies cannot completely isolate themselves as either parties or victims of violent conflicts. The survival and effectiveness of states require a greater focus on countering violent narratives, which is not possible without investing in social empowerment and improving public service delivery.Terrorism is a transnational phenomenon. There is a need for an increased realisation that terrorism and conflicts benefit only a few powerful entities, while the rest pay the costs. For powerful states and violent non-state actors, terrorism is a commercial enterprise and a source of power, pleasure, and profit. The truth is that sole reliance on military might is not an antidote.âDawn (Pakistan)/ANN ","summary":"The post-9/11 War on Terror, like the Cold War, has expanded globally, impacting nations directly and indirectly, with key differences in its nature, scope, and impact on sovereignty, terrorism, and international relations."},{"hash":"9e53b9b3e9dd6179896a69155a0bf5bf946c7abd5e483d2873f557fd5ec6025e","title":"Disaster aftermath:\n\n* Damage to buildings and infrastructure\n* Disrupted utilities (electricity, water, etc.)\n* Loss of communication\n* Damage to homes and belongings\n* Displacement of people","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/11/07/post-disaster-mess","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/editjyotishrestha-1730996688.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1730937600000,"source":"kp","category":"editorial","content":"People in 71 local units across 20 districts in Nepal were affected by rain-induced disasters in the last week of September. Landslides and floods triggered by incessant rains resulted in massive loss of human lives and infrastructure in Bagmati Province, including the Kathmandu Valley, as well as in the hilly districts of Koshi Province. Over 250 people died as several settlements were swept away. Altogether, around 391 people were killed nationwide in water-induced disasters in the monsoon season that started in the second week of June. The disaster victims were still struggling to come to terms with their losses when people across the country were celebrating Dashain and Tihar.Now, a tougher time awaits disaster victims as the country heads into a chilly winter. The displaced people are staying under flimsy tents and tarpaulins, even as the authorities seem incapable of shifting them to temporary huts that could offer them some succour from the biting cold until their permanent houses are built. In his address to the country on October 23, nearly a month after the worst of monsoon disasters, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli directed the agencies concerned to prioritise the task of assessing damages and making temporary huts for the displaced people. In the same address, he conceded that government bodies hadnât even assessed damages from the earthquakes that struck Jajarkot, Rukum West, Bajhang, Doti and Bajura a year ago, let alone carry out reconstruction work. The government had announced a total of Rs50,000 in two instalments to build temporary houses for those displaced in the quakes. According to the state-run newspaper The Rising Nepal, the people of Jajarkot district are yet to get the second instalment.Last winter, elderly people, children, pregnant women and those with chronic health problems suffered a lot in Jajarkot as the quake survivors had to live under flimsy tents for months due to the delay in reconstruction and rehabilitation works. When the mountainous districts witnessed rains during the winter, cold-related ailments including pneumonia caused serious problems, especially for small kids and elderly people. Owing to what can only be described as government apathy, hundreds of those displaced by natural disasters years ago can be seen staying under makeshift huts on river banks or in forest areas in various parts of the country.The problem is not always lack of resources. Mismanagement and the governmentâs failure to properly and timely mobilise available resources is also a reason behind the victimsâ sorry plight. For instance, 77 institutional and individual donors have contributed over Rs1.87 billion to the Prime Ministerâs Natural Disaster and Rescue Fund as of last week. Even in the past, disaster victims would be shivering under makeshift structures while the government would be sitting on the money donated in their name.As Nepal is vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, landslides, floods, glacial lake outbursts and lightning, relevant agencies must be well equipped to help the needy people on time. The situation wonât improve unless there are mandatory provisions with strict timelines to accomplish vital tasks such as assessing damages, shifting the displaced people to temporary huts, distributing money to build permanent houses and for rehabilitation. In the process, the role and responsibility of provinces and local units can be broadened. Also, by coming to the help of the people in times of crisis, the provincial and local governments have an opportunity to prove their relevance as self-governing entities.

He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition campâs strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the governmentâs attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isnât possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the countryâs largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oliâs acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We canât say anything about the government agenciesâ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies canât enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSPâs concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperativesâ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhaneâs case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepalâs development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal canât progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them werenât built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people arenât brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individualsâ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies canât take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministersâMadhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattaraiâwere not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didnât recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings donât fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which arenât.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers werenât prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Donât they need to do public self-criticism?Letâs move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the partyâs transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our partyâs agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesnât mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party canât accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our partyâs present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we havenât reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didnât work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we canât brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we canât say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance. ","summary":"During his term as home minister in the previous Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government that was toppled in mid-July, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who is also senior vice-chair of the CPN (Maoist Centre), undertook some bold actions. He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition campâs strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the governmentâs attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isnât possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the countryâs largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oliâs acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We canât say anything about the government agenciesâ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies canât enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSPâs concerns are valid too.

At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we canât blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one canât build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that donât include these provisions. That doesnât inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures canât withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new lawâs perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. âUnderstanding riskâ is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepalâs mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepalâs hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies.

Last week, two international agenciesâthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)âannounced that Nepalâs economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepalâs economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepalâs economy. How do you see these projections?Nepalâs economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMFâs team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesnât always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We canât achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasnât been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the governmentâs funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasnât been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isnât optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We arenât doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasnât appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasnât given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectorsâenergy and capital marketâon hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed âthe cautiously accommodative monetary policyâ. Donât these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the governmentâs commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they donât want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we canât progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)ânow the National Statistics Officeâin 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldnât be possible without remittance. Therefore, we canât undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the governmentâs plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasnât increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepalâs economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepalâagriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we canât be competitive. The IT sector wonât have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they canât be competitive and grow. But the government doesnât provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis canât compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies arenât favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperativesâ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if itâs not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldnât do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they wonât feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepalâs economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillarsâalong with the government and the private sectorâof the countryâs economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didnât seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They werenât affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isnât enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. ","summary":"Nepalâs economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back. Last week, two international agenciesâthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)âannounced that Nepalâs economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepalâs economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepalâs economy. How do you see these projections?Nepalâs economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth.
