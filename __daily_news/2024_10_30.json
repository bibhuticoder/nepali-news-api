I would also like to reaffirm Nepal’s full support as you undertake the important responsibilities entrusted to you.\nWe extend our deepest appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis, the outgoing President, for his commendable leadership in successfully guiding the 78th Session of the Assembly.\nOur highest accolades are due to the Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres, for his tireless dedication to reinforcing multilateralism in tackling global challenges. \nI fondly recall your visit to Nepal last year, Mr. Secretary-General, and your message of peace from the sacred birthplace of Gautam Buddha, and the message of climate catastrophe of mountains from the Everest region. \nMr. President,\nThe world is at a watershed moment in history. \nThe contrast between rich and poor, harmony and hatred, and economic development and environmental destruction have never been as stark as they are today.\nBoth people and planet stand on the brink of climate catastrophe.\nGeopolitical rivalries are resurging. \nMilitary expenditures are skyrocketing along with an unabetted arms race. \nThe spectre of nuclear conflict looms larger than ever before.\nOn one hand, our economy remains frail, still grappling with the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, on the other, nationalism and protectionism have re-emerged, even before we have reaped the benefits that liberalisation and globalisation were meant to deliver. \nEven after three hundred years of industrialization and modernization journey, it is deeply troubling that in our so-called civilized world of 21st century, wealth and prosperity are concentrated mostly at the hand of Global North and the poverty and destitution are heavily concentrated in the Global South, particularly in the least developed countries (LDCs). \nTo overcome these travesties, we must demonstrate our leadership that promotes meaningful cooperation and collaboration. \nIt is only through collective will and unified action that we can turn the tide and usher in an era of enduring peace and shared prosperity for all.\nIn this context, the theme of this Session “Leaving No One Behind: Acting Together for the Advancement of Peace, Sustainable Development and Human Dignity for Present and Future Generations,” could not be more timely or relevant.\nWe have reaffirmed our commitment through the ‘Summit of the Future’ to build a safe, just, and sustainable world for both present and future generations.  \nThis pledge is embodied in the three pivotal documents we have adopted: Pact of the Future, Declaration on Future Generation, and the Global Digital Compact. \nWe must demonstrate our determination to implement these documents for the wellbeing of present and future generations.  \nMr. President,\nAllow me to underline that the principle of ‘Leaving No One Behind’ has long been the cornerstone of Nepal’s approach to development across all sectors.\nThis philosophy is enshrined in our Constitution which upholds the values of democracy by guaranteeing inclusivity, equality, justice, proportional representation, human rights, and social protection for the most vulnerable sections of society.\nI am determined to lead my country with my deep conviction to ‘comprehensive democracy’. \nFor me, comprehensive democracy ensures equal rights, equal access to opportunities, social justice, protects the vulnerable communities, and provides the security and dignity for all individuals. \nDemocracy goes far beyond the right of the people to choose their leaders. It is about leading the people towards prosperity and happiness so that they could feel highest level of dignity. \nAt the international level, sovereign equality and mutual respect constitute the bedrock of comprehensive democracy. \nThese principles are essential for building the frameworks of a just, inclusive, equitable, representative, and accountable global order. \nMr. President,\nAs a nation emerging from conflict, Nepal deeply understands the profound value of peace and political stability. \nSince the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006, Nepal has been firmly focused on completing the peace process at the earliest. \nImmediately after the formation of my government, parliament passed a Transitional Justice bill to settle transitional justice issue once and for all. \nWhile we implement the law, we will uphold victims’ rights, including truth and justice. \nWe will also use reparations and reconciliation to heal the wounds and scars of conflict period. We appreciate support from international community including the UN system in this regard. \nThe present government, formed by the collaboration of our two major political parties, is determined to secure stability while driving economic transformation for the inclusive and equitable prosperity to our people. \nAt this juncture, stability and economic transformation are paramount to us than our periodic competition in elections. \nWe have dedicated ourselves to realizing our national aspiration: ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali.’\nNepal will be graduating from its LDC status by 2026. We are diligently working towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 and aspire to become a developed country by 2043, despite facing significant economic headwinds. \nHowever, our path to achieving the SDGs remains fraught with difficulties. We are confronted with a substantial financial gap of about 24 billion US dollars to attain the 2030 Agenda. \nIn this backdrop, Nepal hosted the IDA 21 replenishment meeting last June, underscoring the crucial need for continued and enhanced support from the International Development Association along with other development partners. \nIn this pursuit, we strongly reiterate our call for enhanced, predictable, and sustained international support. \nMr. President,\nClimate change has emerged as the gravest threat to our planet, people, and prosperity. \nMy own country, Nepal, is particularly hard hit. We stand as one of the most vulnerable nations to climate change and are ranked as the 20th most disaster-prone country in the world.\nOf utmost concern is the alarming rate at which the pristine Himalayas, often referred to as the Third Pole, are losing their vast snow reserves. \nThis loss threatens water availability for billions of people living downstream, extending far beyond the borders of my country.\nNepal has hugely been contributing to the health of our planet through its forests, mountains and rivers. \nYet, despite these efforts, we continue to bear the brunt of climate change. In this context, we call for climate justice. \nOur mountains play a crucial role in regulating the climate and ecosystem of oceans, with their snow-fed rivers flowing down to the oceans. \nNepal’s Himalayas, as a natural climate stabiliser, help maintain a cooling system in a region situated in the hottest zone of the planet between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.\nGiven their significance, it is essential that the mountain agenda should receive due attention in climate negotiations. \nNepal is steadfast in its commitment to the Paris Agreement and aims to achieve net zero target by 2045, five year earlier than global target. \nAs climate change is a global challenge, it demands global action and collaborative efforts to address its widespread and cascading impacts.\nAdequate climate financing including ‘Loss and Damage’ fund is crucial to support climate-resilient measures and infrastructure for adaptation in developing countries not least in LDCs. \nMr. President,\nNepal’s land is blessed with the wisdom of enlightened great sages from both the Hindu and Buddhist faith, particularly the teachings of Gautam Buddha. \nThis profound legacy has shaped our world view to seek global harmony, peace, and security.\nThe values of love, harmony, tolerance, and empathy as espoused by Gautam Buddha, hold even greater relevance today than they did over two thousand five hundred years ago.\nBut, to our deep dismay, the world is increasingly distressed by division, suspicion, hatred, and enmity. \nNepal firmly believes that dialogue and diplomacy are the sole means to resolve conflicts, including in Ukraine and the Middle East. It is through love and compassion that hostility and hatred can be overcome, paving the way for lasting peace.\nOn the issue of Israel-Palestine conflict, we continue to support a two-state solution, where Israel and Palestine coexist peacefully and securely within internationally recognised borders, in line with relevant United Nations resolutions.\nWe must address the worsening humanitarian crises in regions such as Libya, Syria, Sudan, South Sudan, Yemen, and elsewhere.\nIt is vital to uphold the principles of sovereign equality, non-interference as enshrined in the UN Charter to ensure peace and stability. Consequently, we staunchly oppose any form of unilateral intervention or sanctions.\nMr. President,\nDisarmament and non-proliferation issues must be prioritised. \nNepal strongly advocates for the general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction. As the host country to the UN Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, Nepal firmly believes that regional efforts, including the Kathmandu Process, serve to strengthen the global disarmament regime. \nTechnology presents a double-edged sword, especially for the Least Developed Countries. \nIf we harness it, we can make remarkable progress. If we fail, it will leave us further behind. We call for technology transfer to enable us to catch up. \nMr. President,\nNepal has always adhered to a peaceful, independent, balanced, and non-aligned foreign policy, based on the principles of Panchsheel, the UN Charter, international law, and norms of world peace.\nWe conduct our foreign policy with profound belief in ‘Amity with All, Enmity with None.’\nNepal remains committed to further strengthening its close, cordial, and constructive relations with its immediate neighbours and beyond, rooted in the principles of mutual respect, sovereign equality, territorial integrity, non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, and peaceful co-existence.\nAs the largest contributor of troops and police to UN Peace operations, Nepal stands ready to further enhance its contribution to global peace and security.\nNepal believes it is our rightful call for having commensurate representation in the leadership positions, both at the UN headquarters and in the field, reflecting our significant contribution.\nMr. President,\nNepal firmly advocates for the reform of the UN System to make it more effective, democratic, transparent, and accountable.\nWe firmly believe that stronger multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core, is the only path forward to tackle the numerous global crises we face.\nWe echo a call for substantial reform of the global financial system, as aptly described it by Secretary-General Mr. António Guterres as “morally bankrupt.”  \nThe voice and representation of countries in special situations including the LDCs, Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs), and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) must be ensured. \nMr. President,\nNepal firmly upholds the belief that all human rights are universal, inalienable, indivisible, interdependent, and interrelated. \nIt is with this conviction that we have become a party to twenty-four international human rights-related conventions and protocols, including seven of the nine core instruments.\nWe are fully committed to promoting gender equality and ensuring equal rights for women. Nepal is making necessary legal arrangements for the full realisation of all human rights for women and girls including their sexual and reproductive health rights.\nProtection of the rights of migrant workers including their safety, security, dignity, and wellbeing, has always remained our priority.\nWe strongly advocate for safe, orderly, and regular migration to ensure that the benefits of migration are shared by all.\nFinally, Mr. President,\nThe world we inhabit is far from being perfect.\nYet, it is not all doom and gloom. We firmly believe that humankind is still capable enough to march ahead without compromising the prosperity and happiness of future generations.\nNone of the global challenges we are facing today have been imposed by aliens.  These are our own makings.

It is about leading the people towards prosperity and happiness so that they could feel highest level of dignity. \nAt the international level, sovereign equality and mutual respect constitute the bedrock of comprehensive democracy. \nThese principles are essential for building the frameworks of a just, inclusive, equitable, representative, and accountable global order. \nMr. President,\nAs a nation emerging from conflict, Nepal deeply understands the profound value of peace and political stability. \nSince the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006, Nepal has been firmly focused on completing the peace process at the earliest. \nImmediately after the formation of my government, parliament passed a Transitional Justice bill to settle transitional justice issue once and for all. \nWhile we implement the law, we will uphold victims’ rights, including truth and justice. \nWe will also use reparations and reconciliation to heal the wounds and scars of conflict period. We appreciate support from international community including the UN system in this regard. \nThe present government, formed by the collaboration of our two major political parties, is determined to secure stability while driving economic transformation for the inclusive and equitable prosperity to our people. \nAt this juncture, stability and economic transformation are paramount to us than our periodic competition in elections. \nWe have dedicated ourselves to realizing our national aspiration: ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali.’\nNepal will be graduating from its LDC status by 2026. We are diligently working towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 and aspire to become a developed country by 2043, despite facing significant economic headwinds. \nHowever, our path to achieving the SDGs remains fraught with difficulties. We are confronted with a substantial financial gap of about 24 billion US dollars to attain the 2030 Agenda. \nIn this backdrop, Nepal hosted the IDA 21 replenishment meeting last June, underscoring the crucial need for continued and enhanced support from the International Development Association along with other development partners. \nIn this pursuit, we strongly reiterate our call for enhanced, predictable, and sustained international support. \nMr. President,\nClimate change has emerged as the gravest threat to our planet, people, and prosperity. \nMy own country, Nepal, is particularly hard hit. We stand as one of the most vulnerable nations to climate change and are ranked as the 20th most disaster-prone country in the world.\nOf utmost concern is the alarming rate at which the pristine Himalayas, often referred to as the Third Pole, are losing their vast snow reserves. \nThis loss threatens water availability for billions of people living downstream, extending far beyond the borders of my country.\nNepal has hugely been contributing to the health of our planet through its forests, mountains and rivers. \nYet, despite these efforts, we continue to bear the brunt of climate change. In this context, we call for climate justice. \nOur mountains play a crucial role in regulating the climate and ecosystem of oceans, with their snow-fed rivers flowing down to the oceans. \nNepal’s Himalayas, as a natural climate stabiliser, help maintain a cooling system in a region situated in the hottest zone of the planet between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.\nGiven their significance, it is essential that the mountain agenda should receive due attention in climate negotiations. \nNepal is steadfast in its commitment to the Paris Agreement and aims to achieve net zero target by 2045, five year earlier than global target. \nAs climate change is a global challenge, it demands global action and collaborative efforts to address its widespread and cascading impacts.\nAdequate climate financing including ‘Loss and Damage’ fund is crucial to support climate-resilient measures and infrastructure for adaptation in developing countries not least in LDCs. \nMr. President,\nNepal’s land is blessed with the wisdom of enlightened great sages from both the Hindu and Buddhist faith, particularly the teachings of Gautam Buddha. \nThis profound legacy has shaped our world view to seek global harmony, peace, and security.\nThe values of love, harmony, tolerance, and empathy as espoused by Gautam Buddha, hold even greater relevance today than they did over two thousand five hundred years ago.\nBut, to our deep dismay, the world is increasingly distressed by division, suspicion, hatred, and enmity. \nNepal firmly believes that dialogue and diplomacy are the sole means to resolve conflicts, including in Ukraine and the Middle East. It is through love and compassion that hostility and hatred can be overcome, paving the way for lasting peace.\nOn the issue of Israel-Palestine conflict, we continue to support a two-state solution, where Israel and Palestine coexist peacefully and securely within internationally recognised borders, in line with relevant United Nations resolutions.\nWe must address the worsening humanitarian crises in regions such as Libya, Syria, Sudan, South Sudan, Yemen, and elsewhere.\nIt is vital to uphold the principles of sovereign equality, non-interference as enshrined in the UN Charter to ensure peace and stability. Consequently, we staunchly oppose any form of unilateral intervention or sanctions.\nMr. President,\nDisarmament and non-proliferation issues must be prioritised. \nNepal strongly advocates for the general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction. As the host country to the UN Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, Nepal firmly believes that regional efforts, including the Kathmandu Process, serve to strengthen the global disarmament regime. \nTechnology presents a double-edged sword, especially for the Least Developed Countries. \nIf we harness it, we can make remarkable progress. If we fail, it will leave us further behind. We call for technology transfer to enable us to catch up. \nMr. President,\nNepal has always adhered to a peaceful, independent, balanced, and non-aligned foreign policy, based on the principles of Panchsheel, the UN Charter, international law, and norms of world peace.\nWe conduct our foreign policy with profound belief in ‘Amity with All, Enmity with None.’\nNepal remains committed to further strengthening its close, cordial, and constructive relations with its immediate neighbours and beyond, rooted in the principles of mutual respect, sovereign equality, territorial integrity, non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, and peaceful co-existence.\nAs the largest contributor of troops and police to UN Peace operations, Nepal stands ready to further enhance its contribution to global peace and security.\nNepal believes it is our rightful call for having commensurate representation in the leadership positions, both at the UN headquarters and in the field, reflecting our significant contribution.\nMr. President,\nNepal firmly advocates for the reform of the UN System to make it more effective, democratic, transparent, and accountable.\nWe firmly believe that stronger multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core, is the only path forward to tackle the numerous global crises we face.\nWe echo a call for substantial reform of the global financial system, as aptly described it by Secretary-General Mr. António Guterres as “morally bankrupt.”  \nThe voice and representation of countries in special situations including the LDCs, Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs), and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) must be ensured. \nMr. President,\nNepal firmly upholds the belief that all human rights are universal, inalienable, indivisible, interdependent, and interrelated. \nIt is with this conviction that we have become a party to twenty-four international human rights-related conventions and protocols, including seven of the nine core instruments.\nWe are fully committed to promoting gender equality and ensuring equal rights for women. Nepal is making necessary legal arrangements for the full realisation of all human rights for women and girls including their sexual and reproductive health rights.\nProtection of the rights of migrant workers including their safety, security, dignity, and wellbeing, has always remained our priority.\nWe strongly advocate for safe, orderly, and regular migration to ensure that the benefits of migration are shared by all.\nFinally, Mr. President,\nThe world we inhabit is far from being perfect.\nYet, it is not all doom and gloom. We firmly believe that humankind is still capable enough to march ahead without compromising the prosperity and happiness of future generations.\nNone of the global challenges we are facing today have been imposed by aliens.  These are our own makings. Our own creations. \nTherefore, it is self-evident that by fostering global understanding, trust and cooperation, we can overcome these problems and challenges.  \nA just, inclusive, and equitable world order as well as sustained prosperity are attainable when we collaborate effectively. \nLet me resonate the wisdom of our ancient text, the ‘Maha Upanishad’ from around the sixth century BC, 'Vasudhaiva kutumbakam’: meaning ‘the whole world is one family.’\nWe not only hold this philosophy dearly, but we also act it on our everyday life. \nWith this constant conviction, Nepal is committed to playing its role to secure our shared aspiration of enduring peace, progress, and prosperity while leaving no one behind.\nThank you. \n"},{"hash":"2e9c99d984826bdabeb8f2576c05ffc334f88a7dccce79413d70858df4dfa10f","title":"flower-basket-at-tian-anmen-square","date":1727308800000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/global/flower-basket-at-tian-anmen-square","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/XINHUA+PHOTOS+OF+THE+DAY+XxjpbeE007021_20240926_PEPFN0A0011727350446_1024.jpg","category":"global","content":null,"summary":null},{"hash":"55f173f26ed6d4e0b3ed547e255dae3d3623baa88d3717009d39371a8db8bd35","title":"mcc-ceo-albright-calls-on-prime-minister-oli","date":1727308800000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/global/mcc-ceo-albright-calls-on-prime-minister-oli","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/WhatsApp_Image_2024_09_25_at_231727324519_1024.jpg","category":"global","content":"\n     Alice Albright, the CEO of Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) paid a courtesy call on Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.During the meeting with Prime Minister Oli, who is in New York attending the 79th UN General Assembly, various matters of bilateral interests between Nepal and the US, and MCC projects in Nepal were discussed. \"We look forward to early completion of the project for high quality connectivity through transmission lines and highways,\" the PM has posted on his personal X (formerly Twitter) account following the meeting.\nBishnu Prasad Rimal, Chief Advisor to the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal, among others were also present during the meeting.\n","summary":"\n     Alice Albright, the CEO of Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) paid a courtesy call on Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.During the meeting with Prime Minister Oli, who is in New York attending the 79th UN General Assembly, various matters of bilateral interests between Nepal and the US, and MCC projects in Nepal were discussed. \"We look forward to early completion of the project for high quality connectivity through transmission lines and highways,\" the PM has posted on his personal X (formerly Twitter) account following the meeting.\nBishnu Prasad Rimal, Chief Advisor to the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal, among others were also present during the meeting.\n"},{"hash":"8a04e71bb44841e29d7d44e9a804b3ef65a139fc593ff1dc2f1533bebedc0ed2","title":"pm-oli-urges-nepali-youths-living-abroad-to-return-home-for-employment-creation","date":1730270164293,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/global/pm-oli-urges-nepali-youths-living-abroad-to-return-home-for-employment-creation","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/pm_colambia_u1727146830_1024.jpg","category":"global","content":"\n    Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has urged the Nepali youths living abroad to return home and create employment opportunities.Prime Minister Oli, who is leading a Nepali delegation to the 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, said this at the World Leaders Forum organized by Columbia University on Monday. \nHe clarified that the national aspiration of 'Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali' has been put forward to eradicate poverty and ensure the right of all to live with dignity. \nSpeaking as the keynote speaker at a dialogue on 'Nepal's Journey of Democracy and Economic Development', he said there is only the data of students and youths who have gone abroad from Nepal but not that of returnees. \nNoting that the government has brought out programmes such as small scale industries and 'startups' for employment opportunities, PM Oli urged the youth to unite in nation-building as he was clear that the country could not transform without the youth.  \n\"Nepal's economic situation is not very weak.

As the SDGs deadline of 2030 approaches near, the status of the digital transformation is however unequal among the UN member states.Irrespective of the persisting digital divide, creating a fear of further expansion, a UN report has shown a rise in e-government development with the countries' launch and expansion of strategies, policies, governance initiatives and increased investments in e-governance. \nThe biennial publication of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs released a week back brings the facts and makes meticulous assessments of the digital status through the lens of the E-Government Development Index (EGDI) and the Local Online Services Index (LOSI) of all UN member states.\nThe 'E-Government Survey 2024: Accelerating Digital Transformation for Sustainable Development' has also incorporated a special supplement with one of the defining issues of our time- Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\"The development of digital government has seen a significant upward trend worldwide, with all regions leveraging technology to enhance government services and improve people’s engagement. This shift has accelerated during the post-pandemic recovery period, with increased investment in resilient infrastructure and cutting-edge solutions such as cloud computing and broadband,\" reads the report. \nThe speedy digitalization, adoption of remote work, AI integration in services, emphasis on digital identity and data management, and rise of data and emerging technologies at the policymaking level are major global megatrends as per the survey report.\nThe survey also featured a dominant issue- AI that has influenced government works significantly by creating both opportunities and challenges. It has suggested the need for bridging the widening gaps on the adoption and expansion of modern technology to ensure justice for all. \nThe survey report is divided into five chapters: a digital government model framework for sustainable development; global trends in e-government; regional e-government development and the performance of country groupings; local e-government development; and an addendum on AI and digital government.  \nThe digital divide is a nagging issue before the development, according to the report. To this, Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations, LI Junhua, observed, \"The survey underscores that the digital divide remains a significant challenge, particularly in developing regions like Africa and Oceania and for countries in special situations. Disparities in access and capacity continue to threaten progress toward the 2030 Agenda.\"\nHe underlined the need for intensifying initiatives and innovative works to minimize the gaps, which, Junhua argued, may not be bridged by 2030 irrespective of the positive developments and projections. \nThe UN E-Government Survey was prepared by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the (UN DESA), through its Division for Public Institutions and Digital Government (DPIDG). \nThe Global E-Government Survey has been continued for two decades with biennial publications.\nThe EGDI components are online services index, telecommunications infrastructure index and the human capital index; while LOSI has the components as institutional framework, services provision, content provision, technology, e-participation and e-government literacy. \nNepal improves score, registered as one among LDCs in leading digital development\nTo a positive remark, Nepal has made a significant stride in digital adoption since 2022. \nThe report stated, \"Among the LDCs, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Rwanda, Nepal, Cambodia, and Zambia have been leading  digital development since 2022, and Senegal and Myanmar have joined these high performers in  2024.\"\nNepal is listed as one among twenty-five countries categorized as the middle OSI group.

Globally, among total UN member states, Nepal stands at 119 with an EGDI score of 0.5781.\nMeanwhile, the list of countries at the top of EGDI rankings are Denmark, Estonia, Singapore, Iceland, the Republic of Korea, and Saudi Arabia. They have displayed robust digital leadership as per the report.\nSimilarly, India's global rank in EGDI is 97, China's 35, Bangladesh's 100, and Bhutan's 103.\nIn the global ranking of EGDI Report, 2022, Nepal had stood at 125. \n","summary":"\n    Digital transformation has been prioritized by all countries across the world to realize the sustainable development goals (SDGs). As the SDGs deadline of 2030 approaches near, the status of the digital transformation is however unequal among the UN member states.Irrespective of the persisting digital divide, creating a fear of further expansion, a UN report has shown a rise in e-government development with the countries' launch and expansion of strategies, policies, governance initiatives and increased investments in e-governance. \nThe biennial publication of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs released a week back brings the facts and makes meticulous assessments of the digital status through the lens of the E-Government Development Index (EGDI) and the Local Online Services Index (LOSI) of all UN member states.\nThe 'E-Government Survey 2024: Accelerating Digital Transformation for Sustainable Development' has also incorporated a special supplement with one of the defining issues of our time- Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\"The development of digital government has seen a significant upward trend worldwide, with all regions leveraging technology to enhance government services and improve people’s engagement. This shift has accelerated during the post-pandemic recovery period, with increased investment in resilient infrastructure and cutting-edge solutions such as cloud computing and broadband,\" reads the report. \nThe speedy digitalization, adoption of remote work, AI integration in services, emphasis on digital identity and data management, and rise of data and emerging technologies at the policymaking level are major global megatrends as per the survey report.\nThe survey also featured a dominant issue- AI that has influenced government works significantly by creating both opportunities and challenges. It has suggested the need for bridging the widening gaps on the adoption and expansion of modern technology to ensure justice for all. \nThe survey report is divided into five chapters: a digital government model framework for sustainable development; global trends in e-government; regional e-government development and the performance of country groupings; local e-government development; and an addendum on AI and digital government.  \nThe digital divide is a nagging issue before the development, according to the report. To this, Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations, LI Junhua, observed, \"The survey underscores that the digital divide remains a significant challenge, particularly in developing regions like Africa and Oceania and for countries in special situations. Disparities in access and capacity continue to threaten progress toward the 2030 Agenda.\"\nHe underlined the need for intensifying initiatives and innovative works to minimize the gaps, which, Junhua argued, may not be bridged by 2030 irrespective of the positive developments and projections. \nThe UN E-Government Survey was prepared by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the (UN DESA), through its Division for Public Institutions and Digital Government (DPIDG). \nThe Global E-Government Survey has been continued for two decades with biennial publications.\nThe EGDI components are online services index, telecommunications infrastructure index and the human capital index; while LOSI has the components as institutional framework, services provision, content provision, technology, e-participation and e-government literacy. \nNepal improves score, registered as one among LDCs in leading digital development\nTo a positive remark, Nepal has made a significant stride in digital adoption since 2022. \nThe report stated, \"Among the LDCs, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Rwanda, Nepal, Cambodia, and Zambia have been leading  digital development since 2022, and Senegal and Myanmar have joined these high performers in  2024.\"\nNepal is listed as one among twenty-five countries categorized as the middle OSI group. Some of them in this category are Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Botswana and Cambodia.\nDespite this, Nepal is still behind many countries. Globally, among total UN member states, Nepal stands at 119 with an EGDI score of 0.5781.\nMeanwhile, the list of countries at the top of EGDI rankings are Denmark, Estonia, Singapore, Iceland, the Republic of Korea, and Saudi Arabia.

As per the story that RSS disseminated, Chief at the District Health Office, Angad Bahadur Shahi, said it was not clear whether the girl was immunized against Japanese encephalitis.\nSimilarly, in the major streets of the federal capital itself, notices like 'Here, we fill up forms for visa application', 'Visit us for filling up forms for PSC exam', 'We prepare police reports here' etc are common sights. \nThese two references are just representative stories that are directly linked to the national ambition of 'Digital Nepal'. In the first case, the story showed there was no information/data at the hospital or health facility to ascertain if the girl was immunized, which the government provides before 23 months of one's birth, while the second story shows filling up forms for government services are mediated, but the service seekers themselves are not able to access the service on their own.\nWith the computerized system, people are freed from hand-written forms and waiting in lines for a long time to submit application forms. But, the dearth of digital literacy among the public is reflected well in it. The first story of the unavailability of the girl child's record on her health status signals equally poor data/information management at government offices.\nThe references seem marginal, but they are strong reminders of the current state in the campaign of transforming Nepal into the 'digital Nepal'. \nAs was the case some years back that witnessed huge demand and debate on 'smart city', even the leaders in economic sectors, including line ministers are saying that a time has come for Nepal as well to undergo a structural transformation of the national economy, but they fall short to explain how digital economy could play an integral role in this drive. \nOnce the local levels got the people's representatives for the first time since the enforcement of the current constitution, there was frenzy that 'smart city' could be ensured with the internet access. The debate fizzled out once they became aware that only internet expansion was not enough to set up the smart city. However, there is no denying that internet connection has increased significantly with gradual improvement in quality in Nepal. \nAlthough the internet is a prerequisite for digital transformation, there is much more to do to fully realize the transformation and achieve the ambition of Digital Nepal. The full realization of digital transformation does not leave anyone behind in the journey. Luxury of select people, society, professions, and classes who can afford better than a large number of people is not a transformation, but a blatant reflection of deepening inequality and the widening digital divide.\nOf course, there are many services Nepalis can receive digitally at present. There is a vibrant presence of people in the digital spheres expressing views and keeping close tab on public officials and agencies; media have gone digital; digital entertainment is on the rise; early warnings of weather change and its effects are issued. The drive of a paperless service is also gaining a pace. Even transportation is linked to the digital sphere thanks to ride-hailing services. \nBan on TikTok lifted\nIt is worth noting that the present government has earned accolade by lifting ban on TikTok, one of the most popular social media in Nepal. After lifting the ban, the government hailed the role of social media on promotion of freedom of expression. The TikTok, however, saw the ban for 10 months in the name of 'disrupting social harmony'.  \nDespite this, we have no luxury of being happy over this achievement when we set the ambition of digital Nepal. The ambition needs to be all-encompassing that everyone from the poor, marginalized, and backward communities should be beneficiaries of the digital movements and campaigns. \nWe are in an inclusive and participatory system gained after struggles that lambasted the previous system for not addressing the diverse issues, opinions, demands and needs.

If there is no extension, the rail service will immediately halt, as the KRCL has been providing the technical manpower.Currently, the KRCL supplies 28 railway technicians, including engine drivers, whom the local railway administration has been paying hefty amounts in salaries and perks.Unless Nepal Railway extends the contract with the KRCL, Nepal will have to assume full responsibility for operating the rail service after the contract’s expiry. But due to lack of technical staff, Nepal cannot operate the railway on its own.Despite India’s offer to train Nepali technical staff free of cost for a year, Nepal has been unable to send its staff to India for various reasons.“We have failed to send people to India for training, so this time, we have no option besides giving a one-year term extension to the KRCL,” said Niranjan Jha, general manager of Nepal Railway. “Although the final decision is yet to be made, this is how we are thinking.”As per the existing contract, the Indian company has been providing technical services including two dozen staff and crew members to operate the rail service since it began in April 2022.“We failed to hire the necessary staffers, which is the main reason behind this delay. We also couldn’t prepare the curriculum required for the recruitment exams to staff the rail service. Now, the Public Service Commission has agreed to hire 224 persons for various vacant positions by the end of December,” Jha said. He informed that by the end of June or early July, new technical staff would be prepared and sent to India for training. “By the end of June, we will have prepared the curriculum to ensure that our staff are ready for training,” said Jha.Nepal Railway faced a similar situation last year and had proposed with KRCL to individually hire a few trained Indian nationals to operate the rail service. Nepal Railway said it could not find qualified Nepali technical manpower to operate the rail service.The rail-link was flagged off jointly by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and Indian Prime Minister Modi in April 2022 and was considered a milestone in strengthening cross-border connectivity between Nepal and India.Nepal Railway has hired locomotive pilots, station managers, track engineer, and an air conditioner engineer, among others. “For one time, the Indian side has offered free training to our staff,” said Jha. “We will send more technical staff to train in India. Once they return after training, we will have our own manpower to run the railway service.”Nepal and India are currently working and expanding different cross border railway links, and under the Jayanagar-Bardibas section, work is underway along the 17-km Kurtha-Bhangha (Biajalpura) section. Another is the Bathnaha (India)-Biratnagar (Morang) segment, and 70-kilometer Bardibas-Nijgadh project, which is the part of east-west railway line.Jha said Nepal Railway is going to forward a proposal for giving a one-year term extension to KRCL. “While the current contract is valid till December-end, we will take a decision at an appropriate time and also begin groundwork to train necessary manpower,” he said. Earlier, in November 2022, Nepal Railway had published a vacancy note seeking to hire Nepali staff, but it could not find qualified candidates and had decided to hire Indian staffers instead.As per the Labour Act 2017, Nepali employers can hire foreign staffers if qualified individuals are not available in the country.“If in spite of such an advertisement, no application is received from any Nepali citizen as prescribed or any Nepali citizen cannot be selected, the employer may make an application, accompanied by the evidence thereof, to the Department of Labour for a work permit for hiring foreign labour,” section 22 of the Labour Act-2017 states.Nepal Railway has hired 115 Nepali staff including gate men, point men, and sweepers, while the technical side is handled by Indian staffers.Jayanagar-Kurtha railway is Nepal's first cross-border broad gauge rail link and the first operational rail link between the two countries since services were halted in 2014 for infrastructure upgrade.

Another is the Bathnaha (India)-Biratnagar (Morang) segment, and 70-kilometer Bardibas-Nijgadh project, which is the part of east-west railway line.Jha said Nepal Railway is going to forward a proposal for giving a one-year term extension to KRCL. “While the current contract is valid till December-end, we will take a decision at an appropriate time and also begin groundwork to train necessary manpower,” he said. Earlier, in November 2022, Nepal Railway had published a vacancy note seeking to hire Nepali staff, but it could not find qualified candidates and had decided to hire Indian staffers instead.As per the Labour Act 2017, Nepali employers can hire foreign staffers if qualified individuals are not available in the country.“If in spite of such an advertisement, no application is received from any Nepali citizen as prescribed or any Nepali citizen cannot be selected, the employer may make an application, accompanied by the evidence thereof, to the Department of Labour for a work permit for hiring foreign labour,” section 22 of the Labour Act-2017 states.Nepal Railway has hired 115 Nepali staff including gate men, point men, and sweepers, while the technical side is handled by Indian staffers.Jayanagar-Kurtha railway is Nepal's first cross-border broad gauge rail link and the first operational rail link between the two countries since services were halted in 2014 for infrastructure upgrade.

Based on this provision, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies submitted a legislation draft to the law ministry in September 2019, which then forwarded it to the Judicial Council.As the process was delayed, the Supreme Court, on February 20, 2022, ordered the government to establish consumer courts in all provinces to protect buyers’ interests amid repeated cases of unfair market practices.A division bench of justices Bam Kumar Shrestha and Nahakul Subedi issued the order after the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights Nepal moved the court.Industry ministry officials, however, said setting up a consumer court in a province would be impractical, as people would still have to travel long distances to present their cases. The ministry then decided to gradually set up consumer courts in each district, after piloting it in Kathmandu.The process, however, has been delayed due to frequent government changes.Last fiscal year’s budget announced the formation of a consumer court in Kathmandu on a trial basis and allocated Rs10 million for the purpose.A consumer court is a specialised court which primarily deals with consumer-related disputes, conflicts, and grievances. The court holds hearings to adjudicate these issues.The public has long been demanding consumer courts to bring unscrupulous traders under a legal framework within a fast-track system.Observers say that as consumers do not want to get involved in complex court cases, particularly at the Supreme Court, unscrupulous traders have been emboldened. They believe that once consumer courts are established, filing complaints will become easier and hassles will be minimised.The presence of the consumer courts is expected to have a big impact on the control of food adulteration, artificial shortages, and price manipulation. Consumers now face difficulty accessing water, energy, telecoms, and financial services despite paying for them.Besides, as Nepal’s e-commerce grows, consumer fraud has become more prevalent.Baniya said that a consumer court would be established at the Department of Drug Administration for a temporary arrangement as the property belongs to the industry ministry.However, the top court had ordered the setting up of separate infrastructure.The consumer court will begin hearing cases from Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur. Baniya said the court would gradually be established in other districts. However, the respective district courts will handle consumer complaints until the time consumer courts are established in other provinces.The local governments have also started acting against market malpractices.On October 8, Birendranagar Municipality in Surkhet fined Surkhet Frozen MoMo Food House Rs50,000 for cheating consumers.Due to budget constraints, a consumer court has been established only inside the Valley. However, the Supreme Court has also ordered that consumer courts also be established outside the Valley.Access to and availability of dispute resolution and redress mechanisms are a basic need of consumers, as recognised by the United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection.Baniya said the consumer courts would also ensure fast, faceless, paperless, and right compensation for the victims in consumer cases.“Once the consumer court comes into operation, the consumer with the bill of goods and services can file a case in the dedicated court,” said Baniya. “The consumer will not have to wait for a hearing date as the process will move swiftly.”He said a similar case might take 2–3 years or more in regular courts.Consumer-related cases have been growing, especially in a state of political instability. The number of cases has risen since Nepal adopted digitisation, particularly in e-commerce.In the last fiscal year, the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control filed 178 cases in the District Administration Office, a quasi-judicial authority.Out of 178 cases, 45 concerned processed drinking water, 29 were related to food items and lentils, 22 to sweet items and confectionery, 18 to oil and ghee, 16 to milk and dairy items, and nine to spices.In the review period, the department seized and destroyed edible goods worth Rs11.64 million as the products were found to have expired and were without proper labels.The destroyed products included food items, beer, dalmoth, chips, meat spices, cheese balls, refined flour, suji, juice, pickles, light beverage drinks, and edible oil, and other edible products.In the last fiscal year, the department filed a case against Dugar Spices and Food Products, Budiganga, in Morang District Court for producing low-quality spices, and against Bhat-Bhateni Food Products, Kathmandu, in Kathmandu District Court for producing low-quality lentils.The department filed a case against Dabur Nepal, Bara, in Kathmandu District Court for producing adulterated honey and against CG Oil and Derivatives, Birgunj, in Makwanpur District Court for producing low-quality edible oil.Likewise, a case was lodged against Varun Beverage, Ramgram, in Nawalparasi District Court for adulterated drink. The District Court, Kaski, filed a case against Pokhara Noodles for selling low-quality noodles. CG Foods, Devchuli, was also dragged into Nawalpur District Court for low-quality ready-made noodles.Besides these cases, police say thousands of cases on cyber and e-commerce frauds are filed every year.

In a show of dissent, the party organised a protest rally in Kathmandu on October 26.As the main opposition party in the House, the Maoist Centre marked the new government’s 100th day with the protest rally, but its leaders say they have no specific programmes planned until the by-elections for the local level.The Election Commission is set to hold the by-elections for vacant seats in 39 local units on December 1. “Before the local-level by-election, our party may not organise any major event,\" Yubaraj Chaulagain, a Bagmati Province lawmaker and politburo member of the party, told the Post. “Now our focus will be on the by-elections.” Chaulagain also said that the party will convene a central committee meeting soon after the by-election to chart out the party's strategy ahead. Lekhanath Dahal, a federal lawmaker from the party, echoes Chaulagain, stating that while the party does not have any event, they were encouraged by public participation in their protest rally. He further adds that public interest in the Maoist Centre was evident from the turnout at the rally.“With the support of the people, we will come up with protest programmes against the steps taken by the current KP Sharma Oli-led government, which appears to be encouraging corruption and inefficient governance,” Dahal told the Post.Although Maoist Centre leaders assert that more people support their party because of their effective performance in the immediate past government, political analysts refuse to buy such claims. Like most other political parties, the Maoist Centre has also struggled with a lack of political agenda, which has caused a void in party activity, political analysts claim. “It is one thing to claim that the government under your leadership was better and more effective than others, but to claim that the Maoist Centre’s performance attracting the masses is farcical,” professor of political science Krishna Pokharel told the Post. In Pokhrel's opinion, the lack of a pro-people agenda has caused parties to drift away from the public. A clear example of this is their failure to come up with an effective programme for a long time, he said.Maoist Centre can provide a tough competition in the upcoming general elections if the party establishes itself as a strong opposition in Parliament, Pokharel adds.But the leaders of the Maoist center claim that it is wrong to say that they lack a pro-people programme and agenda. They say that they are working to reunite with the factions that split from the original Maoist party, to attract more public support.Since losing power, the Maoist center has made many efforts to strengthen itself, including reviving the Socialist Front. The party, which later forgot the Socialist Front that it created while in power, organised a meeting in July, right after losing power, and announced plans to reactivate it.However, with other parties affiliated to the Socialist Front focussed on their own internal issues, the front’s activities have stalled. The Front is an alliance of smaller, like-minded political parties with a socialist orientation.However, Lekhanath Dahal, the Maoist Centre leader, claims that the Socialist Front will hold a meeting soon. The Front’s meeting in July had formed a three-member task force to strengthen the front, and based on their recommendations, a full meeting will be scheduled soon.

What was impressive was not just the spectacular victory of our women’s national team against India, the five-time champions, 4-2 on penalties, but also their manifest sportsmanship despite being at the end of some very iffy refereeing decisions.India has always been a formidable team, and this was only the second time our ladies had defeated the southern juggernaut. Although India must have anticipated a competitive match after their 1-0 defeat to Nepal in the tournament’s last edition, surely, they couldn’t have foreseen such a massive turnout of Nepali supporters eager to witness their women players take the field. This, combined with Nepal’s compact defence holding strong despite being down to 10 players, left the Indians formless after the second-half pause, which lasted over an hour following Preeti Kulung Rai’s disallowed equaliser to India’s Sangita Basfore’s 30-yard goal.The umpiring team’s decision to rule out Nepal’s goal following the referee’s restart while the Indians were celebrating Basfore’s strike sparked widespread criticism. The Nepali team had the right to protest; a goal cannot be disallowed after the referee restarts a match. The enraged crowd threw bottles and shouted, “Referee out,” alerting the security personnel in the overflowing stadium. In time, things calmed down and the Nepali women decided to fight back. The star players were Sabitra Bhandari, “Samba,” who scored the equalising goal as well as a penalty kick, and Anjana Rana Magar, the keeper who saved two penalties. The resilience and determination the national women’s team showed on the field touched every Nepali. Yes, the times are changing, and female players are finally getting the appreciation they deserve. However, the country should aim higher. The monthly salary for the women’s team is only around 30,000 per player as of August 2024. Nor do women get many chances to play domestically. Given the inability to earn in Nepal, many players go abroad in search of better opportunities. Likewise, while male footballers are busy playing several national-level leagues around the year, women’s leagues rarely take place and are poorly managed. In terms of prize money, men are usually rewarded with huge cash prizes, whereas the amounts are substantially less for women. Samba, the all-time highest-scoring footballer in Nepal and the only Nepali to play and score in a European league, was discovered by a National team referee in her home district’s women’s football tournament when she was 16. Other female footballers have similar stories. So having more grassroots leagues and tournaments that bring out hidden talents is vital to encourage women. Now, all eyes will be on our ladies who face Bangladesh in the finals today. The absence of Rekha Poudel, Samba’s attacking partner, will be felt as Bangladesh is a strong opponent we failed to defeat last time. But again, win or lose, the Nepali women’s fortitude and sportsmanship displayed last Sunday have already won the hearts of millions of Nepali football fans. They will be happy today so long as the Nepali team gives its 100 percent.  ","summary":"No matter what happens in the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) women’s championship at the Dashrath Rangasala today, Nepali football has already won.

They provided valuable insights into the state of local governance under federalism. This article captures their perspectives, highlighting the successes and obstacles encountered as local governments adapt to Nepal’s evolving federal structure.Pokhara’s mayor Acharya expressed frustration with the perception of local government as mere administrative extensions rather than fully empowered entities. He lamented that local governments have authority over basic services like education and healthcare, yet they face constant resistance from employees unwilling to recognise their jurisdiction. Additionally, the persistence of District Coordination Committees and federal control over resources, such as drinking water and local infrastructure, continues to blur authority and accountability. For Pokhara, a tourism capital, he envisioned support from both federal and provincial levels to realise its full potential. He also noted that without proper intergovernmental coordination, such ambitions remain challenging.In a similar vein, Chairperson Krishna Bahadur Thapaliya of Benighat Rorang Rural Municipality, Dhading, voiced concerns over federalism’s sustainability. Reflecting on the sacrifices of the past, Thapaliya remarked, “We fought for this structure, but educated elites seem to distort it through convoluted interpretations.” He urged leaders to stay grounded in federalism’s original principles to prevent misinterpretations that could weaken the system. Echoing this sentiment, Dan Bahadur Gurung from the Ichchhakamana Rural Municipality of Chitwan underscored the interconnectedness of all three levels of government, stating, “Without empowering local governments, neither the provincial nor federal levels can thrive.”Dambar Bahadur BK, Chairperson of Khajura Rural Municipality in Banke, underscored the need for stable executive provincial governments and called for provincial control over administrative matters like staffing, which currently suffers due to unestablished provincial laws.For many local leaders, decentralisation and fiscal empowerment are central to the federalism debate. Dilip Kumar Rai, Mayor of Pathari Shanishchare Municipality in Morang, raised concerns about the lack of resources and autonomy despite constitutionally granted powers. He highlighted that as per the constitution, land registration should be handled locally, but this authority remains centralised. Furthermore, healthcare expansion has been hindered by budgetary constraints and workforce shortages. “In my municipality with 72,000 residents, we are restricted to a 15-bed hospital, whereas smaller local levels in other regions enjoy greater healthcare facilities,” Rai noted. He stressed that budgeting should reflect population and need, not rigid allocations set without local input.For Nagesh Koirala, Mayor of Biratnagar, the question of provincial relevance is as critical as environmental conservation in Nepal’s Chure region. In response to questions about the viability of federalism, Koirala argued that provinces are integral to governance, likening them to essential ecological systems. “Provinces must remain as pillars of local governance,” he asserted, adding that development programmes should be seen as long-term investments rather than temporary projects. He highlighted that federal and provincial policies must better align with local priorities, suggesting that overemphasising centralised decision-making stifles local autonomy.Nim Bahadur KC, Chairperson of Darma Rural Municipality, Salyan, highlighted fiscal transfers as a significant change but argued that federalism’s survival requires more support for local governance. He expressed concerns over the federal government’s reluctance to transfer administrative authority and reduce fiscal equalisation grants, which weakens fiscal stability at the local level.In Bheri Ganga Municipality, Surkhet, Mayor Yagya Prasad Dhakal pointed out that federalism has no alternative if Nepal aims to achieve good governance and prosperity. He proposed that the federal government focus on national and international affairs, provinces on infrastructure and development and local governments on service delivery. Dhakal argued that mayors need adequate political connections to operate effectively and noted the imbalance in local powers, where municipalities have local police, but provinces lack provincial police forces.Several leaders raised concerns over budgeting and revenue collection constraints. Meena Kumari Lama, Mayor of Hetauda sub-metropolitan city shared the challenges of expanding the local tax base and maintaining good governance amid clashes with contractors and illegal activities. She contended that the lack of a proper fiscal federalism mechanism has hindered the delivery of services and development goals. Sher Bahadur Shahi, Chairperson of Shivalaya Rural Municipality in Jajarkot, voiced concern over the practical implementation of federalism, particularly in the underdeveloped Karnali Province. Shahi criticised the inadequate budget allocation for provincial projects, noting that funds provided are insufficient to address local infrastructure needs, such as purchasing essential supplies like pipelines. He questioned the federal government’s focus, suggesting it seems out of touch with provincial realities and needs.Moreover, many mayors emphasised the importance of federal and provincial collaboration to address local needs and strengthen the country’s federal structure. Vaikuntha Neupane, Mayor of Byas Municipality Tanahun, highlighted the inefficiencies resulting from centralised processes, remarking that local governments still lack essential resources, such as legal officers, for effective administration. This administrative shortfall, he argued, has constrained Nepal’s ability to implement federalism effectively. According to Neupane, the federal government must prioritise local capacity-building to achieve meaningful progress.Rajan Paudel, Mayor of Jitpur Simara Submetropolitan City, suggested a fundamental rethink of federalism implementation. He called on federal authorities to ensure local governments can exercise constitutionally granted rights. “We are the closest to the people,” Paudel said. “Our role is to assess service delivery and local development outcomes that directly impact lives.” This sentiment was echoed by Manoj Kumar Sah, Mayor of Janakpurdham Sub-Metropolitan City, who stressed that questioning federalism’s validity undermines Nepal’s progress. Sah highlighted the need to enforce rights granted to local governments, such as employee management, local law enforcement and public trust in the federal system.For Jawaharlal Yadav, Chairperson of the National Association of Rural Municipalities in Madhesh Provincial Committee, the struggle for federalism and local empowerment goes hand in hand. Yadav pointed out that many government services, from agriculture to tourism, remain tied to the federal level, leading to inefficiencies and limited local impact. “The federal government has retained authority over essential services like agriculture and education that local governments should manage,” Yadav stated.The journey of federalism in Nepal stands at a crossroads, demanding the active engagement of all levels of government, political leaders, policymakers, administrators and citizens. Local government representatives have voiced a clear vision for empowered governance that genuinely reflects the needs of their communities. As Nepal continues this transformative process, federal, provincial and local governments must align to foster accountability, unity and a shared commitment to realising the full potential of federalism. Collective action and sustained support can help Nepal build a federal system that meets the aspirations of its people and enhances the nation’s path toward inclusive development and prosperity.

Nepali universities stand at a crossroads in this mission, with a unique opportunity to embrace the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME) framework. This global initiative provides a roadmap for universities to guide their management programmes toward producing ethical and sustainable leaders. PRME equips future business leaders with the skills to balance economic, environmental and social objectives and strongly emphasises advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With over 800 worldwide institutions committed to this initiative, PRME represents the largest collaboration between the UN and higher education institutions.Regrettably, Nepali universities have yet to demonstrate a strong commitment to integrating the PRME framework or sustainable business practices into their programmes. As the world increasingly looks to business leaders for solutions to global challenges, the time has come for our academic institutions to align their mission with this transformative initiative.A global responsibilityResponsible management education is not new—it has been discussed for nearly 50 years. However, it was only in 2007 that former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon launched PRME under the UN Global Compact as a response to growing concerns about unethical behaviour in the business world. Updated in 2023, the PRME framework consists of seven key principles: Purpose, values, teach, research, partner, practice, and share. These principles are designed to help universities create programmes that produce responsible leaders who contribute to a more just and sustainable society.By adopting the framework, universities can align their educational goals with the 17 SDGs—a global blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet. For business schools, the practical focus on the SDGs in teaching encourages the development of responsible management practices that align with global targets. The SDGs provide a tangible way to assess progress, offering management educators clear benchmarks to work towards developing future leaders.The gap in Nepali universitiesIn Nepal, management education is highly sought-after, with four major universities—Tribhuvan University, Pokhara University, Kathmandu University and Purbanchal University—offering business degrees at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. These institutions collectively educate the largest cohort of Nepalese students in business disciplines such as BBA, BBS, BBM, MBS and MBA programmes.Despite their reach and influence, reviewing these universities’ offerings reveals an alarming lack of emphasis on responsible management and sustainability. For instance, Tribhuvan University’s Faculty of Management claims to produce “socially responsible entrepreneurs,” while Pokhara University aims to develop “responsible citizens of the world.” Yet, neither provides clear details on how these objectives are met nor whether PRME principles are incorporated into the curriculum. Meanwhile, Kathmandu University and Purbanchal University do not mention responsible management at all.These omissions are not merely theoretical. They signal a disconnect between the global shift towards sustainable business practices and the business education offered in Nepal. By failing to integrate PRME, our universities risk producing ill-equipped leaders to address Nepal’s pressing challenges, such as sustainable development, inequality and environmental degradation.Why PRME matters for NepalNepal’s unique development challenges require responsible leadership. The adoption of PRME could be a transformative step, as it provides a framework for Nepali universities to fulfil their social contract with students and the nation. It is no longer enough for universities to offer programmes based on Western business models that prioritise profit over people. Instead, management programmes must cultivate critical thinkers who understand the need for ethical leadership and sustainable practices that align with the needs of Nepal’s local business context.However, Nepali universities face significant barriers. The commercialisation of higher education has pushed many institutions to adopt Western principles that may not align with local needs. Additionally, global accreditation pressures have driven universities to compete with private academic institutions, some of which follow foreign education models that are not regulated by Nepal’s national education body. These trends make it harder for universities to create innovative curricula that challenge unsustainable industry practices and foster the development of responsible leaders.A Roadmap for changeDespite these challenges, management educators in Nepal have a pivotal role in integrating PRME into three critical areas: Teaching, research and engagement.Curriculum reform is essential to embedding PRME in Nepal’s management programmes. Educators should prioritise creating courses on responsible leadership, sustainable business practices and ethical decision-making. Sharing content through academic journals and online platforms, as well as conducting seminars on PRME-related topics will expose students to the latest thinking on responsible management. Regular seminars and workshops should be organised to bring together academics, students and practitioners to discuss the application of these principles in Nepal’s context.Management educators can contribute by researching issues directly affecting Nepal’s economic and social progress, such as the impact of gender inequality on growth, the role of businesses in reducing corruption and sustainable food security. Collaborative research efforts can provide new insights and inform national policy and business practices. These findings will directly benefit the development of responsible leaders capable of addressing Nepal’s pressing challenges.Similarly, active engagement with governments, businesses and the media is crucial for building sustainability capacity. This engagement will ensure that Nepal’s economic growth is both inclusive and sustainable, benefiting all sections of society. By partnering with the private sector, educators can also provide students with real-world examples of responsible management practices, enriching their learning experience.By embracing the PRME framework, Nepali universities can fulfil their obligation to prepare students for the complex challenges of the modern world. Beyond technical skills, universities must instil in future leaders a deep commitment to sustainability, ethics and social responsibility. The framework offers a practical pathway to achieve this, helping universities align their curricula with the global call for responsible management.It is time for Nepali universities to move beyond traditional business education models and adopt a forward-looking approach that addresses local and global challenges. Only then can they produce the leaders Nepal needs—those who will not only excel in the global market but also contribute to creating a more sustainable future for all, contributing to the real achievement of SGDs in Nepal.

Nearly a decade after Nepal’s embrace of federalism, the country’s provincial governments remain in a state of limbo. This has not only tarnished their image in the eyes of the general public but cast doubt on their very existence. People from different walks of life are calling for ditching the provinces altogether. But amid these calls, it is once again worth asking what has rendered the provinces ineffective. A small example from Karnali Province exemplifies the hurdles that provinces face. In 2019, the province came up with the idea of having an integrated administrative building to enhance its service delivery. But the project couldn’t get off the ground as the federal Ministry of Urban Planning never permitted the province to use the land at the proposed site. This case speaks volumes about the federal-provincial divide: If a province has to beg with the federal government for years to put up a building, what are its chances of getting more substantive rights and resources?The centralised approach is also evident in the federal level’s hesitation to adjust the police force at the provincial level. The federal government hasn’t even implemented the Police Personnel Adjustment Act endorsed by the federal parliament in 2019. The oversight extends to other critical areas like the passage of the Federal Civil Service Act. For example, the provinces demand that chief district officers function under provincial governments. Having their own police force and civil servants would have greatly helped with the functioning of the provincial governments—yet the leaders at the centre seem intent on blocking this all-important reform. Provinces also face obstacles in establishing autonomous institutions and managing resources locally, such as collecting fines and penalties in the transport sector. Such financial restriction adds to the burden provinces already face due to the 26 percent reduction in fiscal equalisation grants for the provinces, as we saw in this fiscal year. This in turn makes provinces dependent on the federal government for financial sources—which is apparently what their federal overlords want. What’s more, even the conditional grants they get are aligned to federal priorities rather than their own. These bottlenecks have severely limited the provincial governments’ initiatives and made it nearly impossible for them to respond effectively to their unique needs.The constitution of Nepal guarantees rights and powers to all three tiers of government—federal, provincial and local. Yet the federal government is reluctant to grant provinces their deserved rights, undermining decentralisation. In response, these provincial governments have repeatedly demanded that their voices be heard.

This is something positive, as it will build pressure on the federal authorities. All seven provinces should unite to make more efforts to hold the federal government accountable to the provinces’ needs.The sorry state of our provinces shows our federal authorities are uninterested in devolving power to provinces and in equal development across the country. This is a deceit as it goes against the spirit of federalism. If the public grievances against the provincial governments continue, it might embolden demands to abandon federalism altogether. Federalism in Nepal will thrive only if the leaders in Kathmandu abandon their centralised mindset and commit, above all, to empowering the provinces—the indispensable middle tier between the federal government and the local units.  ","summary":"The centrality of provinces in the healthy functioning of federal Nepal cannot be emphasised enough. Nearly a decade after Nepal’s embrace of federalism, the country’s provincial governments remain in a state of limbo. This has not only tarnished their image in the eyes of the general public but cast doubt on their very existence. People from different walks of life are calling for ditching the provinces altogether. But amid these calls, it is once again worth asking what has rendered the provinces ineffective. A small example from Karnali Province exemplifies the hurdles that provinces face. In 2019, the province came up with the idea of having an integrated administrative building to enhance its service delivery. But the project couldn’t get off the ground as the federal Ministry of Urban Planning never permitted the province to use the land at the proposed site. This case speaks volumes about the federal-provincial divide: If a province has to beg with the federal government for years to put up a building, what are its chances of getting more substantive rights and resources?The centralised approach is also evident in the federal level’s hesitation to adjust the police force at the provincial level. The federal government hasn’t even implemented the Police Personnel Adjustment Act endorsed by the federal parliament in 2019. The oversight extends to other critical areas like the passage of the Federal Civil Service Act. For example, the provinces demand that chief district officers function under provincial governments. Having their own police force and civil servants would have greatly helped with the functioning of the provincial governments—yet the leaders at the centre seem intent on blocking this all-important reform. Provinces also face obstacles in establishing autonomous institutions and managing resources locally, such as collecting fines and penalties in the transport sector. Such financial restriction adds to the burden provinces already face due to the 26 percent reduction in fiscal equalisation grants for the provinces, as we saw in this fiscal year. This in turn makes provinces dependent on the federal government for financial sources—which is apparently what their federal overlords want. What’s more, even the conditional grants they get are aligned to federal priorities rather than their own.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) announced that the Montreal Convention liability limits for death, injury, delays, baggage, and cargo issues will increase on December 28, 2024. Nepal implemented the Montreal Convention for the first time on December 15, 2018. Millions of air passengers worldwide are entitled to compensation for yearly flight delays, cancellations, and overbooking. Because passengers are unaware of their rights and airlines make it so hard to get their money, less than 2 percent receive their flight compensation, according to a study. Here is what you need to know about the Montreal Convention and your air passenger rights. Claim what you owe.What is the Montreal Convention 1999 or MC99?The Montreal Convention is a multilateral treaty adopted by a diplomatic meeting of International Civil Aviation Organisation member states in 1999. Ratified in 1999 and enacted in 2003, the Montreal Convention was a successor to the Warsaw Convention 1929.Formally known as the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, the Montreal Convention 1999 (or MC99) has established a comprehensive and unified framework for the international carriage of passengers, baggage, and cargo by air. It introduced several elements to balance the interests of travellers, cargo shippers, and the aviation industry. The Convention sets liability limits for airlines, ensuring fair compensation for consumers in cases of injury, death, delay, baggage and cargo issues. ICAO has informed the 140 State Parties that the limits will increase in line with the Convention’s built-in review mechanism, which adjusts for inflation every five years. This ensures that passenger and cargo compensation remains appropriate over time. This is the fourth review since the treaty came into force in 2003. \"ICAO continues to advocate for the universal ratification of MC99,\" said Juan Carlos Salazar, the ICAO secretary general, in a statement. \"This Convention is fundamental in protecting consumer interests in international air travel. By promoting harmonisation and codification of rules governing international carriage by air, MC99 benefits passengers and cargo shippers while enabling the unified and equitable development of air services.\"What are the liability provisions?The liability limits are indicated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), a unit of account defined by the International Monetary Fund. For indicative purposes, 1 SDR has been valued at US$ 1.33318 on October 18, 2024. What are the revisions? The limits will be revised as follows: 1. The death or bodily injury limit will increase from 128,821 SDRs to 151,880 SDRs (about US$202,500). It originally was 100,000 SDRs in 2003. 2. The limit for passenger transport delays will rise from 5,346 SDRs to 6,303 SDRs (about US$8,400). 3. The limit for baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay will increase from 1,288 SDRs to 1,519 SDRs (about US$2,000). 4. The limit for cargo destruction, loss, damage, or delay will rise from 22 SDRs to 26 SDRs per kilogram (about US$35). ICAO has invited the States Parties to MC99 to make provisions as necessary in accordance with their domestic legal requirements, to give full effect to the revised limits as of December 28, 2024.What’s the case of Nepal?The Montreal Convention allows air passengers on international flights to claim compensation for damages caused by travel disruptions and luggage problems. Since travellers in Nepal are not aware that they can file a compensation claim, many passengers protest at the airport against the delays, cancellations, baggage damages and other issues caused by the airlines' negligence. For example, if the passengers' baggage is damaged, under the rule, passengers can claim up to $2,000 with the particular airline.However, the Montreal Convention waives the airline’s liability in cases where extraordinary circumstances caused the flight disruption. Such cases include adverse weather, Air Traffic congestion and restrictions, lightning strikes, bird strikes, strikes at the airport, medical emergencies, security threats, and political unrest, etc. You can also claim when … ?On November 30 last year, Flight RA229 of the state-owned Nepal Airlines flew two hours before its scheduled departure, leaving 31 passengers stranded at midnight at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport. The reason for the rushed departure was the flight’s VVIP status. Then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal was on the same flight. The flight was planned for Dahal, who left for Dubai leading the Nepali delegation to the 28th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 28). According to experts, the case is severe negligence by the airline company, and passengers can still file compensation cases as per the Convention.The MC99 extends a time frame within which a passenger can claim compensation for damages – up to two years following the occurrence of the flight disruption. If the claim pertains to damaged, lost, or delayed luggage, it's imperative to report the issue expeditiously. Claims for damaged baggage should be filed within seven days, while claims for delayed baggage must be initiated within 21 days. If your bags remain unclaimed for more than 21 days and are considered lost, you still can file a claim within two years.Where to file the claims?According to Vijay Shrestha, vice-president of administration at Himalaya Airlines, passengers can file a compensation claim by filling out a “property irregularity form” at the airline office or the airline’s ground handling agent in any destination airport.Luggage will be categorised as lost if the airline cannot trace it for 21 days from filing the property irregularity report. All claims shall be substantiated with an itemised list of contents, description, age, and proof of purchase or ownership of all items. At Kathmandu airport, passengers can file compensation claims for loss, delay, or damage at the lost and found unit of Nepal Airlines. “The compensation provision used to be printed on tickets, but since airlines issue e-tickets nowadays, passengers can go to the ‘contract of carriage by air’ on the airline's website to know the information regarding the loss, delay, or damage,” said Shrestha. Is MC99 applicable to domestic airlines? The MC99 makes only international airlines liable in case of passenger death or injury.A year after Nepal adopted the MC99, preparations for adopting a similar law started but could not proceed, although the draft had been prepared.Tourism ministry officials say the process was stalled multiple times as governments changed. Since 2019, there have been six fatal plane and helicopter crashes that killed 130 people, and all the families of the victims have been barred from a justifiable compensation that would be $100,000 as per the proposed provisions.The air carriers’ liability and insurance draft bill for domestic airlines has been sent to the finance ministries for their comments before being tabled by the Cabinet. After the Cabinet nod, the bill will be tabled in Parliament.What’s the provision in the proposed domestic law? As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost and damaged shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the airlines, it says. The cargo damage is limited up to $5,000.The compensation for the hand baggage, if lost or damaged, shall be $400.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons.

Amid the festive atmosphere, Matrika Bhandari sat on the terrace with his five-year-old son, Soham. Soham tugged at his father’s sleeve, eager to show him the kites his cousins were flying outside.However, Bhandari’s attention was elsewhere—he was engrossed in his phone, scrolling through TikTok videos.After several failed attempts to get his father’s attention, Soham gave up. He wandered over to a corner of the room, found his tablet, and started playing a game. Later that evening, during dinner, Bhandari complained to his relatives, “I just don’t know what to do with Soham. Children of today can’t live without phones… He’s always glued to his tablet!”Ironically, as he voiced this concern, he was checking a WhatsApp message on his phone. What Bhandari failed to notice was the reflection of his habits in his son’s growing attachment to screens.It’s the time of festivals again, and familiar scenes of families and relatives coming together are playing out. Yet another common sight will be children and teenagers huddled in the living room, their heads bowed over their phones. Conversations will often start with parents and relatives lamenting that children have become ‘addicted’ to their phones—a topic that is sure to come up at almost every Nepali family gathering this festive season.However, what often goes unnoticed is that in many such living room gatherings, it’s not only the younger generation immersed in screens; their parents are just as preoccupied.It’s common to see parents handing their phones to children to keep them entertained or distracted while they focus on work, or playing videos like ‘Baby Shark’ during mealtime to help their kids eat. And the parents are busy with social media.Research says parents’ excessive use of phones influences their children’s screen habits—and this link is often overlooked.This isn’t without consequences. A study published in PubMed found that greater child and parental exposure to electronic media was linked to a smaller expressive vocabulary at age 2 and negatively impacted language development by age 5. Another study involving parents of 421 Estonian children between the ages of 2.5 and 4 years old revealed that parents who spent more time on screens had children who also used screens more frequently. These children exhibited poorer skills in grammar and vocabulary. The study, which was published in the journal ‘Frontiers’, emphasises the importance of parent-child verbal interactions in language development.Consider Dipika Jha from Maitighar, Kathmandu, a mother who once enjoyed imaginative tea parties with her daughter Kenjal. By the time Kenjal turned four, Dipika’s attention had shifted to her phone during their playtime. As Dipika scrolled through her social media feeds, Kenjal’s attempts to engage her mother grew increasingly desperate. Over time, Kenjal stopped trying and became increasingly silent. It was only a year later through Kenjal’s teacher that Dipika realised that her emotional absence was stunting Kenjal’s emotional development.Kenjal has begun to mimic her mother’s detachment. This lack of parental engagement was diminishing her ability to express emotions and build meaningful relationships.Research supports this growing detachment. The 2024 study published in ‘Frontiers’ also found that children’s emotional intelligence is negatively impacted by their parents’ phone use. When parents use screens in the presence of their children, the outward appearance of distraction sends a powerful message, “I’m not present.” This leads to what researchers call ‘still face,’ an expressionless appearance that can further inhibit a child’s ability to develop emotional skills.This parental ‘technoference’—the interference of technology in routine parent-child interactions—has far-reaching effects. According to a 2023 cohort study published in ‘JAMA Network’, children whose parents frequently used phones reported higher levels of anxiety, attention issues, and hyperactivity. The study, which tracked over 1,300 children aged 9-11, found that parental phone use disrupts important emotional and social cues, contributing to developmental delays in children. However, in today’s fast-paced work environment and digital landscape, many parents feel they have no choice.Laxmi Upadhyay, a grocery shop owner and a parent of a nine-year-old from Lalitpur, says, ‘These days, everything from paying bills to shopping and work is tied to our phones. It may seem like parents are always on their phones, but it’s hard to avoid using them.”Psychologist Bina Shrestha from “Mankaa Kura” (a mental health platform) says the solution isn’t for parents to avoid phones entirely, but tailoring the content they consume and their device habits. She adds, “With work now tied to gadgets and phones, especially for parents juggling jobs and further studies, people spend a lot of their time on devices. In the past, it was easier to separate work from home, but now, phones blur that line, leading to a lack of emotional and social connection for children.”According to her, from a child’s perspective, it often seems like their parents are constantly on their phones, and with the already poor communication patterns in many Nepali families, this lack of interaction creates a gap in parent-child relationships.Anuja, a 16-year-old from Kalanki, has seen this play out firsthand. Anuja (who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) shared how her father, a reporter for an online media outlet, is always busy with his phone or laptop, even during family time. “Even at home, during dinner or family time, his attention is divided between us and his devices. I miss having real conversations with him, and now my eight-year-old brother is following the same habit, constantly playing video games on his phone”, said Anuja.The effects of this detachment are not only emotional but also behavioural, says psychologist Shrestha. Children, like Soham and Kenjal, mimic their parents’ screen habits, reinforcing a cycle of phone dependency that starts early and persists into adolescence. Dangers though don’t end with emotional detachment.With greater exposure to the internet comes heightened vulnerability. Research conducted by Voice of Children and KNH Germany in 2023 showed that 38.6 percent of girls and 32.3 percent of boys reported receiving sexual calls and messages.In fiscal year 2023-24, the Nepal Cyber Bureau recorded 635 cases of cyber violence involving children, up from 176 cases in fiscal year 2022-23—for a 260.8 percent rise.As parents manoeuvre the digital age, the responsibility of guiding their children through it has never been more critical. The irony of parents lamenting their children’s phone addiction while mirroring the same behaviour is a cycle that must be broken. Children are not born obsessed with screens—they learn it from the adults around them, says Shrestha. According to Shrestha, parents should establish work timetables, just as children have study schedules, to help kids understand when it’s time for work and when it’s family time. Parents should also explain to their children the purpose behind their phone or gadget usage. “As a work-from-home parent, I’ve made it a point to help my young child understand that when I’m on my phone, I’m working, as this differentiation is crucial for young children to learn….Otherwise, children may simply mimic our behaviour of spending time on gadgets and become isolated.”Many parents fall into the habit of giving their phones to their children to keep them occupied while they manage household chores. Shrestha warns that this practice diminishes critical parent-child interaction. Instead, she suggests watching appropriate and fun content together, which can create bonding and interaction for the emotional and language development of children.“Regulating screen time shouldn’t solely focus on limiting children’s usage; parents also need to manage their device habits. Children imitate parent’s behaviour so parents should model healthy interactions with technology”, she adds.

What Bhandari failed to notice was the reflection of his habits in his son’s growing attachment to screens.It’s the time of festivals again, and familiar scenes of families and relatives coming together are playing out. Yet another common sight will be children and teenagers huddled in the living room, their heads bowed over their phones. Conversations will often start with parents and relatives lamenting that children have become ‘addicted’ to their phones—a topic that is sure to come up at almost every Nepali family gathering this festive season.However, what often goes unnoticed is that in many such living room gatherings, it’s not only the younger generation immersed in screens; their parents are just as preoccupied.It’s common to see parents handing their phones to children to keep them entertained or distracted while they focus on work, or playing videos like ‘Baby Shark’ during mealtime to help their kids eat. And the parents are busy with social media.Research says parents’ excessive use of phones influences their children’s screen habits—and this link is often overlooked.This isn’t without consequences. A study published in PubMed found that greater child and parental exposure to electronic media was linked to a smaller expressive vocabulary at age 2 and negatively impacted language development by age 5. Another study involving parents of 421 Estonian children between the ages of 2.5 and 4 years old revealed that parents who spent more time on screens had children who also used screens more frequently. These children exhibited poorer skills in grammar and vocabulary. The study, which was published in the journal ‘Frontiers’, emphasises the importance of parent-child verbal interactions in language development.Consider Dipika Jha from Maitighar, Kathmandu, a mother who once enjoyed imaginative tea parties with her daughter Kenjal. By the time Kenjal turned four, Dipika’s attention had shifted to her phone during their playtime. As Dipika scrolled through her social media feeds, Kenjal’s attempts to engage her mother grew increasingly desperate. Over time, Kenjal stopped trying and became increasingly silent. It was only a year later through Kenjal’s teacher that Dipika realised that her emotional absence was stunting Kenjal’s emotional development.Kenjal has begun to mimic her mother’s detachment. This lack of parental engagement was diminishing her ability to express emotions and build meaningful relationships.Research supports this growing detachment. The 2024 study published in ‘Frontiers’ also found that children’s emotional intelligence is negatively impacted by their parents’ phone use. When parents use screens in the presence of their children, the outward appearance of distraction sends a powerful message, “I’m not present.” This leads to what researchers call ‘still face,’ an expressionless appearance that can further inhibit a child’s ability to develop emotional skills.This parental ‘technoference’—the interference of technology in routine parent-child interactions—has far-reaching effects. According to a 2023 cohort study published in ‘JAMA Network’, children whose parents frequently used phones reported higher levels of anxiety, attention issues, and hyperactivity. The study, which tracked over 1,300 children aged 9-11, found that parental phone use disrupts important emotional and social cues, contributing to developmental delays in children. However, in today’s fast-paced work environment and digital landscape, many parents feel they have no choice.Laxmi Upadhyay, a grocery shop owner and a parent of a nine-year-old from Lalitpur, says, ‘These days, everything from paying bills to shopping and work is tied to our phones. It may seem like parents are always on their phones, but it’s hard to avoid using them.”Psychologist Bina Shrestha from “Mankaa Kura” (a mental health platform) says the solution isn’t for parents to avoid phones entirely, but tailoring the content they consume and their device habits. She adds, “With work now tied to gadgets and phones, especially for parents juggling jobs and further studies, people spend a lot of their time on devices. In the past, it was easier to separate work from home, but now, phones blur that line, leading to a lack of emotional and social connection for children.”According to her, from a child’s perspective, it often seems like their parents are constantly on their phones, and with the already poor communication patterns in many Nepali families, this lack of interaction creates a gap in parent-child relationships.Anuja, a 16-year-old from Kalanki, has seen this play out firsthand. Anuja (who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) shared how her father, a reporter for an online media outlet, is always busy with his phone or laptop, even during family time. “Even at home, during dinner or family time, his attention is divided between us and his devices. I miss having real conversations with him, and now my eight-year-old brother is following the same habit, constantly playing video games on his phone”, said Anuja.The effects of this detachment are not only emotional but also behavioural, says psychologist Shrestha. Children, like Soham and Kenjal, mimic their parents’ screen habits, reinforcing a cycle of phone dependency that starts early and persists into adolescence. Dangers though don’t end with emotional detachment.With greater exposure to the internet comes heightened vulnerability. Research conducted by Voice of Children and KNH Germany in 2023 showed that 38.6 percent of girls and 32.3 percent of boys reported receiving sexual calls and messages.In fiscal year 2023-24, the Nepal Cyber Bureau recorded 635 cases of cyber violence involving children, up from 176 cases in fiscal year 2022-23—for a 260.8 percent rise.As parents manoeuvre the digital age, the responsibility of guiding their children through it has never been more critical. The irony of parents lamenting their children’s phone addiction while mirroring the same behaviour is a cycle that must be broken. Children are not born obsessed with screens—they learn it from the adults around them, says Shrestha. According to Shrestha, parents should establish work timetables, just as children have study schedules, to help kids understand when it’s time for work and when it’s family time. Parents should also explain to their children the purpose behind their phone or gadget usage. “As a work-from-home parent, I’ve made it a point to help my young child understand that when I’m on my phone, I’m working, as this differentiation is crucial for young children to learn….Otherwise, children may simply mimic our behaviour of spending time on gadgets and become isolated.”Many parents fall into the habit of giving their phones to their children to keep them occupied while they manage household chores. Shrestha warns that this practice diminishes critical parent-child interaction. Instead, she suggests watching appropriate and fun content together, which can create bonding and interaction for the emotional and language development of children.“Regulating screen time shouldn’t solely focus on limiting children’s usage; parents also need to manage their device habits. Children imitate parent’s behaviour so parents should model healthy interactions with technology”, she adds.

He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well. ","summary":"Here’s what Prime Minister KP Oli told the parliament on Monday, saying he was giving the address for a “special” reason: “Nepal wants to maintain neighbourly relations as a good neighbour, not a petty, scheming neighbour…Nepal wants a similar behaviour on the part of its neighbours.”He pursued this line of argument, implying that India is wishing ill on Nepal, imposing on Nepal’s sovereignty and interfering in its independent status and policy. He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML).

Designed in 1651 by Gian Lorenzo Bernini for the then-Pope, Innocent X, the fountain depicts the major rivers of the four continents where papal authority had spread: the Nile, Danube, Rio de la Plata – and the Ganges.For the average Western tourist, it’s an impressive sight, a grand spectacle. For the average Indian, too, it is that, and perhaps too an evocation of pride: this is our river, our Ganga. (It’s a different matter that Bernini’s Ganga is a muscular and heavily bearded man, not at all the makara-riding goddess Indians know her as).But, inaccuracies and all, Bernini’s Ganga is an interesting reflection of just how vital this river is, how resoundingly a symbol of India. In Europe, which in 1651 still knew little of the exotic East, the Orient was exemplified by the Ganga; in India, it has been not just water, not just life, but much more. Mother, saviour, purifier, the very heartbeat of India, the core of Hinduism.It is this river that Siddharth Kapila sets out to trace in Tripping Down the Ganga: A Son’s Exploration of Faith (Speaking Tiger Books, 2024). The book brings together Kapila’s travels along the Ganga: more specifically, to seven spaces situated beside the river that are the focus of yaatras or pilgrimages for Hindus. As Kapila explains in his introduction to his memoir, these journeys took place in two different time periods: one, in the 7 years between 2015 and 2022; and another in earlier years, when Kapila went on yaatras along with his mother.These journeys intertwine through the book, the same spot – whether Kedarnath or Badrinath, Gangotri or Kashi – experienced at two different times. Kapila intersperses memories of less than a decade back with those of nearly 30 years ago, creating an interesting palimpsest of places, pilgrimages, people.The people are what shine through bright and clear here, because it is their faith that takes centre stage. Kapila’s conversations, both with those around him and with himself, grow increasingly insightful and deep as the book progresses.He talks to holy men who brave ice-water baths in Gangotri; to Naga sadhus, the warriors sworn to protect the faith; to the formidable (and unsettlingly ‘different’, for some people?) Aghoris, who haunt the cremation grounds at Kashi. He discusses spirituality both with Westerners journeying through India, as well as his partner, a young Aghan edging towards Buddhism.And, importantly, he dwells on the faith of his mother, a tax lawyer who is deeply devout and for whom her religion comes through as the fulcrum of her life. Many of the yaatras Kapila narrates are performed in his mother’s company, but there are other ways too in which she enters the narrative: in conversations, in her son’s views on organised religion and faith (often widely divergent from those of his mother’s), even in his discussion of the dichotomy that seemingly reveals itself in his mother. A hard-headed, clear-minded, utterly rational lawyer when she’s at work, but a believing, ritual-driven devotee when she’s not. The faith, in its many avatars, its many forms, shows up in diverse ways. For instance, the quiet devotion of the many people who give up their lives with family and home to turn sanyasi (and there are several of these in this book, including the Kapila family’s own Swamiji).But, in contrast to that quiet devotion, the boisterous and loud ‘masti married to bhakti’ which Kapila describes in context of the kaanwariyas who trek every season to the Ganga to draw water. Or, as he puts it, the ‘Great Indian Free-For-All’: pushing, shoving, loud, exuberant devotees, making no bones about their religious fervour.Tripping Down the Ganga, however, isn’t merely an exposition of the author’s own faith or the faith of those he encounters on his journeys; it is, too, a closer look at the religion, and at its intersection with other religions, other organised structures; at Hinduism’s fraught relationship with Buddhism and its even more fraught relationship with Islam; at the burgeoning (especially in recent times) of the connection between religion and politics, and the hidden realities of issues such as the Gyanvapi Masjid and the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor Project.Part travelogue, part memoir, part introspection, this book manages to bring together many aspects of the Ganga and all that surrounds its status as India’s most sacred river. Kapila’s writing is conversational, occasionally even humorous.He makes no pretence to erudition (though his research is obviously solid and extensive), and there’s a sincerity, a clear-sightedness that shines through. It does not, however, dull his faith, and one gets the impression that this is an individual whose faith is unswerving, but not at the cost of his humanity: he straddles two worlds, just as his mother seems to do. That subtitle ‘A Son’s Exploration of Faith’, turns out to be a worthy tribute to Kapila’s mother.Published in special arrangement with TheWire.in ","summary":"In the heart of Rome’s Piazza Navona stands one of the city’s most famous fountains: Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, the ‘Fountain of the Four Rivers’.

This is the standard theory in the airline industry. Mismanagement + poor planning + high demand + low supply = super high fares, and passengers suffer. This is the case in Nepal.Flight prices are leaving travellers frustrated in a country that aspires to attract 1.6 million tourists by the end of this year to come to the aid of its ailing economy. Airfares have increased nearly fourfold in Southeast Asia, while they have more than doubled for flights to the West.For instance, travel agencies say a one-hour and 15-minute Kathmandu-Delhi flight will now cost Rs80,000 one way from the first week of November, which is the highest rate of a flight based on the Reservation Booking Designator (RBD). Airlines just don’t hike fares arbitrarily. Through the RBD, the selling fare follows a stair-step pattern, ranging from the lowest to the highest fares, with a difference of $15 to $100 for each step. The lowest fare, rarely available in the sector, is Rs42,000. Nepal Airlines, which has hardly increased its rates, has issued a Rs48,000 fare for its business class ticket, as economy class seats are sold out for the Delhi sector.But inbound flights or Delhi-Kathmandu flights cost Rs17,500.This is because, from November 8, Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport will be closed for 10 hours a day, from 10 pm to 8 am, for five months until March 31, to expand the taxiways.September-November is Nepal’s peak tourist season and the time when migrant workers and other Nepalis studying and working abroad return after celebrating key festivals at home.Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being constructed at the northern end of the runway.Travel trade entrepreneurs say it is an unplanned construction that is taking way too long and will extend to another peak tourism season in spring (in March). “As a result, ticket prices are now at all-time highs,” said Shyam Raj Thapaliya, managing director of Osho World Travel Nepal, one of the leading travel agencies. He said airlines must cut 50 percent of flights, so demand has risen exponentially. “Airlines are scrambling to manage the slots as they have already sold tickets to foreigners a year in advance,” said Thapaliya.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave at least Rs50 billion in revenue from the airline and tourism industry, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.What is the airfare in other sectors?After Kathmandu-Delhi flights, Sydney is the most frequented at this time and the most in-demand sector in November. The upper fare in the Kathmandu-Sydney sector is Rs217,000, and the lowest is Rs114,000. The normal one-way airfare on the route used to be Rs85,000.Flying to Washington, D.C., the US, from Kathmandu will cost Rs192,000 for a one-way at the higher end. The standard fare for this route used to be Rs100,000. Similarly, the Kathmandu-London fare has climbed to Rs217,000, and the lowest ticket price is Rs142,000. The normal airfare used to be Rs72,000 on this route.Ticket prices in the labour destinations have also spiked. According to travel agencies, the Kathmandu-Dubai ticket has jumped to Rs171,000 at the higher end, while the cheapest option is Rs82,000. The normal fare used to be Rs35,000 in this sector.Likewise, the Kathmandu-Kuala Lumpur flight will cost Rs54,000, while the cheapest option is Rs39,000. The normal fare in the sector used to be at Rs29,000. The airfares started rising before the airport construction. Rama Sharma booked a flight from Kathmandu to New Delhi on Monday, for November 5, and the cheapest option she found was Rs67,000 for an economy return ticket on an Air India flight. Sharma says that two-way tickets used to cost roughly Rs40,000. “For those prices, I should be able to fly two round-trips in this sector,” she adds, expressing her frustration. “Passengers are being victimised from all sides.”“A friend of mine from Bombay called to say that the direct flight cost to Kathmandu is almost the same as the cost of direct flights to Athens. Any reason why the price of Bombay-Kathmandu flight tickets have skyrocketed?,” Prajwal Raj Gyawali wrote in X, formerly Twitter, on October 23. “Cost of Delhi-Kathmandu return ticket by @IndiGo6E reaches nearly 1 lakh rupees [Rs 100,000]. What kind of tourism promotion is this?” an X handle Kamala93 wrote. “@PM_nepal_The govt should immediately see why this is happening?”Mani Raj Lamichhane, director of the Research, Planning and Monitoring Department of Nepal Tourism Board (NTB), the country’s tourism promotional body, said that airport construction for long hours in the peak season would be a big setback as it would reduce flight frequency, increase airfare, and keep tourists from coming to Nepal. “Raising airfare fourfold will make a big dent to any country’s tourism.\" He said most hotels have started receiving cancellations for November due to the high airfares and the possibility of chaos at Kathmandu airport. “Most airlines connect Kathmandu at night to manage their connecting flights. Closing an international airport for 10 hours is not a wise decision.”The tourism board has also revised its tourist arrival numbers for 2024, to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. “The planned construction will also affect spring tourism next year.”Worried tourism entrepreneurs, who have seen tourists coming to Nepal despite repeated plane crashes, have urged the government to reduce the construction time to five hours from the proposed 10 hours. The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal has been ordering international airlines to make some flight arrangements from Pokhara and Bhairahawa international airports to reduce pressure. However, airlines are reluctant to fly from those airports, as they don’t consider it technically and financially feasible. A senior official of one international airline told the Post that the civil aviation body has been forcing airlines to fly from Bhairahawa, regardless of their refusal. “It’s a punitive measure.” The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade association of the world’s airlines that advocates for travellers’ safety, security, and efficiency, issued a letter to the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal on October 1 after plans to close the airport evoked concerns from multiple sides.The letter, obtained by the Post, said the reduction in operating hours is causing airlines to cancel flights at short notice, inconveniencing passengers who booked tickets a year in advance. “IATA has been informed that Tribhuvan International Airport will reduce its operating hours from 8 November 2024 to 31 March 2025 to facilitate runway maintenance. Additionally, IATA has noted that there has been no proportional reduction in established schedules. Some airlines have received schedule approvals during the affected period, while others have not.”IATA has suggested conducting a comprehensive demand and capacity assessment. Kathmandu airport was designed as a Level 1 airport, which should theoretically meet airline demand. The Level 1 category means that airport capability is generally adequate to meet demand. However, airlines have reported that their schedules cannot be accommodated during maintenance. IATA has recommended that the civil aviation body reduce the daily closure period by two hours and avoid closure on the week's busiest days.   ","summary":"High demand + lower supply = higher fares.

Airfares have increased nearly fourfold in Southeast Asia, while they have more than doubled for flights to the West.For instance, travel agencies say a one-hour and 15-minute Kathmandu-Delhi flight will now cost Rs80,000 one way from the first week of November, which is the highest rate of a flight based on the Reservation Booking Designator (RBD). Airlines just don’t hike fares arbitrarily. Through the RBD, the selling fare follows a stair-step pattern, ranging from the lowest to the highest fares, with a difference of $15 to $100 for each step. The lowest fare, rarely available in the sector, is Rs42,000. Nepal Airlines, which has hardly increased its rates, has issued a Rs48,000 fare for its business class ticket, as economy class seats are sold out for the Delhi sector.But inbound flights or Delhi-Kathmandu flights cost Rs17,500.This is because, from November 8, Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport will be closed for 10 hours a day, from 10 pm to 8 am, for five months until March 31, to expand the taxiways.September-November is Nepal’s peak tourist season and the time when migrant workers and other Nepalis studying and working abroad return after celebrating key festivals at home.Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being constructed at the northern end of the runway.Travel trade entrepreneurs say it is an unplanned construction that is taking way too long and will extend to another peak tourism season in spring (in March). “As a result, ticket prices are now at all-time highs,” said Shyam Raj Thapaliya, managing director of Osho World Travel Nepal, one of the leading travel agencies. He said airlines must cut 50 percent of flights, so demand has risen exponentially. “Airlines are scrambling to manage the slots as they have already sold tickets to foreigners a year in advance,” said Thapaliya.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave at least Rs50 billion in revenue from the airline and tourism industry, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.What is the airfare in other sectors?After Kathmandu-Delhi flights, Sydney is the most frequented at this time and the most in-demand sector in November. The upper fare in the Kathmandu-Sydney sector is Rs217,000, and the lowest is Rs114,000. The normal one-way airfare on the route used to be Rs85,000.Flying to Washington, D.C., the US, from Kathmandu will cost Rs192,000 for a one-way at the higher end. The standard fare for this route used to be Rs100,000. Similarly, the Kathmandu-London fare has climbed to Rs217,000, and the lowest ticket price is Rs142,000. The normal airfare used to be Rs72,000 on this route.Ticket prices in the labour destinations have also spiked. According to travel agencies, the Kathmandu-Dubai ticket has jumped to Rs171,000 at the higher end, while the cheapest option is Rs82,000. The normal fare used to be Rs35,000 in this sector.Likewise, the Kathmandu-Kuala Lumpur flight will cost Rs54,000, while the cheapest option is Rs39,000. The normal fare in the sector used to be at Rs29,000. The airfares started rising before the airport construction. Rama Sharma booked a flight from Kathmandu to New Delhi on Monday, for November 5, and the cheapest option she found was Rs67,000 for an economy return ticket on an Air India flight. Sharma says that two-way tickets used to cost roughly Rs40,000. “For those prices, I should be able to fly two round-trips in this sector,” she adds, expressing her frustration. “Passengers are being victimised from all sides.”“A friend of mine from Bombay called to say that the direct flight cost to Kathmandu is almost the same as the cost of direct flights to Athens. Any reason why the price of Bombay-Kathmandu flight tickets have skyrocketed?,” Prajwal Raj Gyawali wrote in X, formerly Twitter, on October 23. “Cost of Delhi-Kathmandu return ticket by @IndiGo6E reaches nearly 1 lakh rupees [Rs 100,000]. What kind of tourism promotion is this?” an X handle Kamala93 wrote. “@PM_nepal_The govt should immediately see why this is happening?”Mani Raj Lamichhane, director of the Research, Planning and Monitoring Department of Nepal Tourism Board (NTB), the country’s tourism promotional body, said that airport construction for long hours in the peak season would be a big setback as it would reduce flight frequency, increase airfare, and keep tourists from coming to Nepal. “Raising airfare fourfold will make a big dent to any country’s tourism.\" He said most hotels have started receiving cancellations for November due to the high airfares and the possibility of chaos at Kathmandu airport. “Most airlines connect Kathmandu at night to manage their connecting flights. Closing an international airport for 10 hours is not a wise decision.”The tourism board has also revised its tourist arrival numbers for 2024, to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. “The planned construction will also affect spring tourism next year.”Worried tourism entrepreneurs, who have seen tourists coming to Nepal despite repeated plane crashes, have urged the government to reduce the construction time to five hours from the proposed 10 hours. The Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal has been ordering international airlines to make some flight arrangements from Pokhara and Bhairahawa international airports to reduce pressure. However, airlines are reluctant to fly from those airports, as they don’t consider it technically and financially feasible. A senior official of one international airline told the Post that the civil aviation body has been forcing airlines to fly from Bhairahawa, regardless of their refusal. “It’s a punitive measure.” The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade association of the world’s airlines that advocates for travellers’ safety, security, and efficiency, issued a letter to the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal on October 1 after plans to close the airport evoked concerns from multiple sides.The letter, obtained by the Post, said the reduction in operating hours is causing airlines to cancel flights at short notice, inconveniencing passengers who booked tickets a year in advance. “IATA has been informed that Tribhuvan International Airport will reduce its operating hours from 8 November 2024 to 31 March 2025 to facilitate runway maintenance. Additionally, IATA has noted that there has been no proportional reduction in established schedules. Some airlines have received schedule approvals during the affected period, while others have not.”IATA has suggested conducting a comprehensive demand and capacity assessment. Kathmandu airport was designed as a Level 1 airport, which should theoretically meet airline demand. The Level 1 category means that airport capability is generally adequate to meet demand. However, airlines have reported that their schedules cannot be accommodated during maintenance. IATA has recommended that the civil aviation body reduce the daily closure period by two hours and avoid closure on the week's busiest days.   "},{"hash":"3842287c87f8c671cceca89add68a50281a8834d978348f879e1ff0795047dca","title":"gold-could-reach-rs200-000-per-tola-by-mid-2025","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/10/28/gold-could-reach-rs200-000-per-tola-by-mid-2025","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/money/Untitled4-1730080841.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1730073600000,"source":"kp","category":"money","content":"Nepal’s gold dealers have predicted a further bullish trend, just as the precious metal surged to a new high of Rs167,400 per tola in the local bullion market on Sunday.Manik Ratna Shakya, immediate past president of the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association, said they have estimated that the gold price may cross the Rs200,000 mark by mid-2025, triggered by various external factors like geopolitical tensions and the US election.International media reports say that an Iranian attack on Israel could influence gold.Investors often seek safety during a crisis, directing their funds towards assets like gold.

A study has suggested an Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD)-based payment system as an alternative for financial access.The USSD channel for payments allows financial transactions to be made using the basic features of mobile phones without internet connectivity. It is one of the most widely used offline payments, aiming to financially deepen and include the marginalised and under-banked population in banking services.It is a protocol used by the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) network to communicate with payment service providers’ platforms. USSD is a session-based, real-time messaging communication technology accessed through a string, usually starting with an asterisk (*) and ending with a hash (#), for instance *500#.According to Nepal’s central bank study report on the USSD-based payment system and its regulations, USSD technology is considered a cost-effective, faster, and handset-agnostic mode of payment due to its short turnaround time and data privacy.The report said that in Nepal, 50 percent of adults from rural areas and 40 percent of adults from urban areas still lack an account at a financial institution.USSD-based payment allows merchant payments and accessible credit facilities to people, especially in rural and marginalised settings.USSD offers access to digital financial services in areas where telecom network connectivity is poor for voice telephony or where there is no or poor internet connectivity. To use the service, you do not require a smartphone.The report said that the feature phone ownership rate in Nepal is higher than that of smartphones in rural municipalities and provinces.Madhesh Province has 12.97 percent feature phone penetration and 11.60 percent smartphone penetration. In Karnali Province, there is 4.51 percent feature phone penetration and 3.21 percent smartphone penetration.Similarly, Sudurpaschim Province has 6.84 percent feature phone penetration and 5.42 percent smartphone penetration.The report said this provides opportunities to increase financial inclusion by targeting feature phone users in rural municipalities and select provinces with a USSD-based payment system.The expert says that if mobile operators start a USSD-based payment system, it will definitely aid in financial inclusion and make daily transactions easy with just a text message.Most rural and even urban populations are not used to app-based payment services, and a USSD-based payment system will allow those populations to make transactions quickly and conveniently. According to the report, small and medium entrepreneurs in rural areas benefit from it by taking credit and making payments.Sanjib Subba, a fintech expert, said that the USSD-based payment needs to be implemented effectively as many people still use feature mobile phones, so there is a connectivity issue for financial inclusivity.“In a country like Nepal, where internal migration is huge, USSD payments can be made easily by sending money person-to-person (P2P) and person-to-merchant (P2M),” said Subba.He added that a USSD-based payment system needs to be pushed.Telcos are the primary carriers and telecom service providers like Nepal Telecom and Ncell, which help bring financial inclusivity to the last mile through the USSD. Experts said the cost of moving money through a USSD-based payment system needs to be minimal or even zero. In 2009, Hello Paisa, in partnership with Laxmi Bank, introduced a USSD-based payment system in Nepal. Nepal started using a USSD-based payment system for mobile financial services in 2021. In March 2021, the central bank issued the payment service provider license to Nepal Digital Payments Company (NDPC) Limited to implement USSD-based mobile financial services.NDPC was established with a key stake in Nepal Telecom and Rastriya Banijya Bank Limited. In September 2021, NDPC launched the NamastePay *500# USSD service for its NamastePay wallet, which has basic features such as user registration, mobile top-up, and P2P transfer.However, the uptrend in app-based financial systems like eSewa wallet (commenced in 2010), mobile banking applications (initiated in 2012), Inter-bank payment system (IPS, launched in 2016), connectIPS (launched in 2018), and others began well before 2021, offering offer sophisticated user experience valued by customers, the adoption of USSD channel, which has its underlying limitations, was constrained.According to the study report, first, customers extensively use app-based systems with intuitive user experience; USSD may not be quickly adopted as the primary payment channel. This is evident from the lower adoption of NDPC’s USSD-based mobile financial system. However, according to the study, the USSD channel can be an alternative when app-based online payment systems cannot be accessed.Second, it can be costly for the customer and the financial service provider. If the session dropout rates are not controlled, customers may be liable for higher transaction fees. For financial service providers, adding USSD as a channel by bearing the capital expenditure and operational costs may not be justifiable, as people have already adopted innovative app-based payment systems, the report said.Third, as USSD menus are generally complex to navigate, it is challenging to create appropriate user awareness considering customers' geography, administrative construct, and literacy level.The report said that USSD could benefit customers as an alternative to existing payment systems by providing easy mobile phone top-up or recharge service using the USSD channel when the customer runs out of balance and lacks internet connectivity.It enables elderly people and others who are accustomed to feature phones to access government-to-person (G2P) payments (such as pensions and other government transfers) through the USSD channel.The report recommends that the telecommunication authority mandate all mobile network operators to provide USSD for mobile financial services. To ensure a uniform customer experience, the authority should explore the possibility of mandating all mobile network operators to implement a common USSD code for mobile financial services.

The federal government has already been providing Rs100,000 in relief to each cancer patient, including children, while the provincial government provides another Rs100,000. Officials said that the Health Ministry will cover any additional amount required for the treatment of children under 14 years with cancer from its internal sources.A few days ago, Paudel also promised free care for impoverished burn victims who cannot afford treatment costs.However, most health facilities that offer burn care provide only basic treatment, which often do not ensure patient safety.Experts have welcomed the government’s decisions. However, they questioned the effectiveness and sustainability of the programmes announced by Paudel. They say that previous ministers and governments would have made similar decisions if there were simple solutions.“Most programmes announced by the current health minister cannot be implemented due to various limitations,” said Dr Sagar Rajbhandari, a health expert. “Those who are unaware of the limitations and working style of our health system could be impressed by these populist announcements, but the reality is quite different.”Due to the lack of positron emission tomography (PET) scans, immunohistochemistry, bone marrow transplants, and other tests available for children, patients are often compelled to travel to India for treatment. Health facilities providing cancer care for children said that they lacked support staff, including trained nurses and paramedics. “Along with the decision to provide free care to children with cancer, we hope the government will invest in improving health facilities with the necessary equipment and trained human resources, which will help ensure quality care within the country,” said Dr Sudhir Sapkota, a pediatric oncologist at the Kanti Children’s Hospital. “Many patients cannot afford to go to India for these tests.”According to doctors, PET scans are essential for determining the stage of cancer. This test provides more accurate reports than any other in identifying local or metastatic tumours (which spread to other areas of the body).Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is commonly used to diagnose cancer, predict response, and determine likely disease outcomes. It also helps distinguish between different types of cancer.Likewise, bone marrow replacement is necessary when existing bone marrow fails to work properly with new stem cells. Bone marrow transplantation provides new stem cells, which help kill cancer cells directly.“‘If we can start offering the aforementioned services within the country, patients do not have to go India or other countries for treatment,” said Sapkota. “I hope the government will also work to address these shortcomings in the coming days.”It is estimated that every year in Nepal, around 1,500 children under 14 years of age suffer from various types of cancer. Of them, around 200 seek treatment at the Kanti Children’s Hospital. Doctors at the hospital said that around 50 percent of the patients suffer from blood cancer. Those seeking care at the first and second stages of cancer have a chance of full recovery. However, due to a lack of diagnosis facilities in most parts of the country, many patients seek treatment at the third and fourth stages. ","summary":"Minister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel announced on Sunday that the government would provide free treatment to children under 14 years of age suffering from various types of cancer.The move is the latest in a series of populist announcements made by Paudel since taking office around three months ago.While most of these initiatives—reducing hospital wait times, increasing government health insurance coverage to Rs500,000, and providing outpatient care on public holidays—are yet to be implemented, Paudel continues to announce new free programmes.According to a press statement issued by Paudel’s secretariat, free cancer treatment will be provided by Kanti Children's Hospital, Bhaktapur Cancer Hospital, and Chitwan-based BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital, starting November 16. The federal government has already been providing Rs100,000 in relief to each cancer patient, including children, while the provincial government provides another Rs100,000. Officials said that the Health Ministry will cover any additional amount required for the treatment of children under 14 years with cancer from its internal sources.A few days ago, Paudel also promised free care for impoverished burn victims who cannot afford treatment costs.However, most health facilities that offer burn care provide only basic treatment, which often do not ensure patient safety.Experts have welcomed the government’s decisions. However, they questioned the effectiveness and sustainability of the programmes announced by Paudel. They say that previous ministers and governments would have made similar decisions if there were simple solutions.“Most programmes announced by the current health minister cannot be implemented due to various limitations,” said Dr Sagar Rajbhandari, a health expert. “Those who are unaware of the limitations and working style of our health system could be impressed by these populist announcements, but the reality is quite different.”Due to the lack of positron emission tomography (PET) scans, immunohistochemistry, bone marrow transplants, and other tests available for children, patients are often compelled to travel to India for treatment. Health facilities providing cancer care for children said that they lacked support staff, including trained nurses and paramedics. “Along with the decision to provide free care to children with cancer, we hope the government will invest in improving health facilities with the necessary equipment and trained human resources, which will help ensure quality care within the country,” said Dr Sudhir Sapkota, a pediatric oncologist at the Kanti Children’s Hospital. “Many patients cannot afford to go to India for these tests.”According to doctors, PET scans are essential for determining the stage of cancer. This test provides more accurate reports than any other in identifying local or metastatic tumours (which spread to other areas of the body).Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is commonly used to diagnose cancer, predict response, and determine likely disease outcomes. It also helps distinguish between different types of cancer.Likewise, bone marrow replacement is necessary when existing bone marrow fails to work properly with new stem cells. Bone marrow transplantation provides new stem cells, which help kill cancer cells directly.“‘If we can start offering the aforementioned services within the country, patients do not have to go India or other countries for treatment,” said Sapkota. “I hope the government will also work to address these shortcomings in the coming days.”It is estimated that every year in Nepal, around 1,500 children under 14 years of age suffer from various types of cancer. Of them, around 200 seek treatment at the Kanti Children’s Hospital. Doctors at the hospital said that around 50 percent of the patients suffer from blood cancer. Those seeking care at the first and second stages of cancer have a chance of full recovery. However, due to a lack of diagnosis facilities in most parts of the country, many patients seek treatment at the third and fourth stages.

They claimed that while infection rates have increased of late, the number of severe cases and deaths has not increased proportionately. But experts say the situation is far worse than what the authorities admit.The rise in infection rate has not only overwhelmed general hospitals of the Kathmandu Valley, but also caused an acute blood crisis, increased premature birth, low birth weight, and a shortage of paracetamol in pharmacies. “Many patients suffering from dengue shock syndrome, hemorrhagic fever, pneumonia, diarrhoea, and multi-organ failure due to severe dengue have been admitted to our hospital,” said Dr Niraj Bam, an associate professor at the Institute of Medicine, TUTH. “Agencies responsible must take measures immediately to break the chain of the infection and prevent an exponential rise in new cases.”Public health experts blame the apathy of health agencies and government for the exponential rise in cases. They say neither the concerned health agencies nor the government are taking the situation seriously.“Previously, we used to carry out search and destroy drives frequently to destroy mosquito breeding sites, launch awareness drives, and request security agencies for blood donations to manage the dengue epidemic,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, former director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “But now, no measures are being taken to control the spread of the virus. None of the agencies has considered dengue as a public health emergency.”Experts said more concerning is the fact that the authorities have been attempting to conceal the infection and death rates to avoid criticism, and this is worsening the impact on the general public. “Hundreds of people wait for hours every day for blood at blood banks for their seriously ailing relatives admitted at various hospitals in Kathmandu Valley,” said Sandesh Thapa, a public relations officer at the Central Blood Transfusion Service (blood bank). “But the collection is too low. Even organisations in districts outside the Valley are unable to organise blood donation camps.”Officials at the blood bank said daily demand is around 400 pints, mostly from dengue patients, while donations are only around 30 to 40 pints.“Since the morning, I have received around 40 calls from organisations that previously organised blood donation camps, asking for blood for their former donors,” said Thapa. “But blood can’t be manufactured or bought, and the rise in dengue cases along with the festive season has reduced donations.”Blood bank officials have been asking the relatives of patients to find donors on their own and to post donation requests on social media.Public health experts warn of dire consequences if the seriousness of the dengue outbreak continues to be undermined. They say that the rise in premature births, low birth weights of newborns, and complications in pregnancy will lead to maternal and child mortality rates and jeopardise the achievements made from years of investments and endeavours. “A lot of people have been hospitalised, and hundreds more have been infected. Their experiences are harrowing,” said Dr Ghanshyam Gurung, executive director at the TUTH. “Authorities should not wait for the temperature to drop and the infection rate to decline naturally.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.So far, only 11 people have died, and over 22,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often concealed the actual number of deaths and infections.As there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms, including platelet-rich plasma transfusion.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives.Meanwhile, in view of the rising dengue cases, a meeting of the Council of Ministers on Thursday has decided to conduct a 10-minute cleanup campaign in all government offices at 10 am on Friday to remove mosquito breeding sites. The decision was made on the recommendation of the Ministry of Health. Officials said staffers will look for stagnant water in puddles, discarded tyres and bottles, among other things, during the campaign.  ","summary":"A 60-year-old man from ward 7 of Bidur Municipality in Nuwakot district, succumbed to dengue on Wednesday night.The man was first rushed to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH) on Monday night as his condition deteriorated, and later to a private hospital for intensive care due to a lack of vacant intensive care unit beds at the TUTH.Doctors attending the victim suffered from severe dengue, which led to shock, internal bleeding and multiorgan failure.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population, however, claimed that dengue was not the direct cause of death, as the victim also had high blood pressure.

Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” "},{"hash":"43a55d20ac4c2642a82a8875ae85cd6d1fef613e84688fb31954ecfd843b76e9","title":"the-trials-and-tribulations-of-home-baking","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/food/2024/06/28/the-trials-and-tribulations-of-home-baking","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/Homebaking-1719539203.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1719532800000,"source":"kp","category":"food","content":"I can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  "},{"hash":"a90b9db6c3c38cf48a1d63805bc18a62428b153ecbe76daccdb8010d4b8e3b5d","title":"this-summer-i-saw-the-everest-up-close","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/travel/2024/06/23/this-summer-i-saw-the-everest-up-close","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/main-1719107987.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1719100800000,"source":"kp","category":"travel","content":"“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask.

Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it.

NATO said on Monday that thousands of North Korean troops were moving toward the front line.The development has alarmed Kyiv, which has said sanctions would not be enough and called for more weapons and an international plan to keep the North Korean troops at bay.South Korea, which remains technically at war with the nuclear-armed North decades after the 1950-1953 Korean War, also condemned the deployments, with officials in Seoul particularly worried about what Russia may be providing to Pyongyang in return.North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui arrived in Russia’s far east on Tuesday on her way to Moscow, Russian state media said. Russian state news agencies said it was not clear who Choe, making her second visit in six weeks, would meet in Moscow.The Kremlin said Putin had no plans to meet her. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Tuesday and said the North Korean moves were sending the war into an unprecedented phase.“The conclusion is clear - this war is becoming internationalized, extending beyond two countries,” Zelenskiy said on X.Yoon told Zelenskiy that if North Korea receives aid from Russia and is able to glean military experience and knowledge from its involvement in the war it would pose a “great threat” to South Korea’s security, according to a statement from South Korea's presidential office.South Korea has said it may start supplying weapons to Ukraine if North Korean troops joined Russia’s war. The Pentagon also said on Monday it would not impose new limits on Ukraine's use of US weapons if North Korea entered the fight.Russian President Vladimir Putin has not denied the presence of North Korean troops in the country.What role the North Korean troops may play is unclear. Analysts say their small number and possibly limited capabilities are unlikely to be decisive, but they could shore up Russian forces by providing manual labor or manning defensive positions.They are also likely to play a political role for Russia and North Korea, strengthening their hands in relations with China, which has an uneasy partnership with both countries, and sending a message to Washington and its allies, Western diplomats and analysts said.“The closer Moscow's ties to Pyongyang, the more leverage it expects over US allies as well as China,” Gilbert Rozman, of The Asan Forum, wrote for the US-based 38 North programme.Moscow needed a partner hostile to the status quo, wary of China but unwilling to antagonize it, and helpful in meeting arms or perhaps labor needs, he said.A few thousand North Korean troops will not change the course of the war so it may be a Russian attempt to underscore to the United States just how disruptive Moscow can be if it wants to be, said one diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.“Integrating North Korean troops into a very complex war machine is not easy. But using their presence to scare the United States and its allies in Asia is quite simple,” the diplomat said. “The key question is: to what extent is Russia actually changing its whole post-Soviet approach to North Korea?”Troops TrainingThe Ukraine conflict broke out when Russia invaded its neighbor in February 2022 and has since developed into a war of attrition largely fought along front lines in eastern Ukraine, with huge numbers of casualties on both sides.The Pentagon estimated 10,000 North Korean troops had been deployed to eastern Russia for training, up from an estimate of 3,000 troops last Wednesday.The military in Russia was trying to teach military terminology to the North Korean soldiers, South Korean lawmakers briefed by the country's spy agency said on Tuesday.Moscow was also continuing to provide technical support for North Korea’s attempts to field a fleet of spy satellites, the lawmakers said.For months North Korea has been providing Russia with short-range ballistic missiles, artillery shells, and other weapons, according to intelligence officials in the United States, South Korea, and Ukraine.Putin has said it is Russia’s business how to implement a partnership treaty he signed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June, under which the two countries agreed to support each other if one of them came under attack.South Korea has yet to change its stance against openly providing weapons to Ukraine, but Seoul expedited plans to share intelligence with NATO and dispatched a senior delegation to brief officials in Brussels and Kyiv.

The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” ","summary":"Chaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka.

She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. ","summary":"In 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

The importance of Dashain for Nepalis living in and out of the country cannot be exaggerated. Actually, Dashain is not a pan-Hindu affair; however, over the years, high-caste hill rulers have constructed it—specifically the red tika—as a powerful symbol of national and cultural identity. I also celebrated Dashain this year, albeit in a secular way. I didn’t participate in any religious function or apply the red tika on my forehead; I put a black tika instead. My black tika is not against Dashain or the Hindu religion as such. It’s my symbolic protest against the persistently anti-Dalit rituals and customs associated with many festivals, including Dashain. I’d like to consider this my satyagraha. I will resume putting the red tika in Dashain once Dalits are treated equally in the communities, especially in the places of worship. Festivals perpetuate untouchability Following the age-old tradition, Nepal’s President Ram Chandra Paudel and Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli issued a statement this Dashain, praising the festival’s significance in strengthening social harmony and goodwill. Well, this observation may be true for others, but not Dalits. What Dashain has done is it has normalised and popularised caste hierarchy and the subordination of Dalits. The festival sees Dalits being openly excluded and humiliated at the holy sites, at homes and in neighbourhoods. There have been some changes over the years, of course, but many of the ancient customs and rituals that pulverise Dalit’s self-respect and dignity are still widely practised. It’s sad that although the Hindu monarchy has gone, its legacy continues to bite Dalit communities hard. And the democratically elected governments and parliaments have largely turned a blind eye to this persistent problem. They refuse to mention the fact that underneath public celebration and jubilation, many Dalits are deeply hurt. And no writer, journalist, analyst, or politician dares to speak against the tradition.That includes Dalit activists, too. Mainstream Dalit discourse is still shy about discussing issues related to religion and culture; all it focuses on is the constitution and law. The law isn’t that bad, but it’s difficult to precisely enforce it due to the strong religious and cultural resistance to change, as seen during Dashain rituals in Durga temples. Does the Goddess discriminate?Essentially, Dashain is Durga upasana—the worship of the goddess Durga, who symbolises power and victory over evil. This Dashain, I visited some historical temples of goddesses located near Kathmandu. I observed some of the rituals and also interviewed the priests and Dalits working there—mainly the temple drummers from the local Damai community. I also visited the temple of Palanchowk Bhagawati in Kavrepalanchowk District, which was built by King Mandev long before the formation of the modern Nepali state. The temple is famous among Nepalis, especially during occasions like Dashain. When I arrived, nitya puja—the daily worship by the priest–was going on. Devotees were waiting in a queue; they’d be allowed to worship after the puja was completed. A few Brahmins were reciting verses from Devi Bhagwat. The Newar priest was busy chanting inside the temple, ringing a little bell with one hand and offering flowers to the statue with the other.Just outside the temple, in front of the door, stood a Damai man beating his drum. His family has been performing for the goddess for many generations; however, his father, grandfather and ancestors have never been allowed into the temple.Once the nitya puja was over, the priest came out and offered red tika to his staff, well-wishers and locals. He also blessed them by sprinkling the holy water. But he didn’t come near the drummer, let alone apply the tika on his forehead! He was given the tika on a leaf. And that leaf, too, wasn’t given on his hand—it was thrown at his drum. All this happened in front of everybody. I later asked the drummer if he felt humiliated, and he replied no. He’s always treated as an untouchable at the temple door. Besides, he’s given the tail end of the sacrificed goats and buffaloes, symbolising his social rank and position. I was surprised to hear that even in such a big temple close to the capital city, local Dalits have no access. The priest would claim that there’s no discrimination there. In a sense, he’s right: He doesn’t ask anonymous devotees about their caste background. But the fact is that local Dalits, whom he and his staff recognise, can’t enter the temple. Next, I visited the temple of Goddess Bhairavi atop a hill in the historical fort of Nuwakot. The temple stood before the seven-storey durbar erected by Prithvi Narayan Shah. Talking to both the priest and a Damai man drumming and cleaning up the temple compound, I learnt that local Dalits aren’t allowed into the temple here, either. The same rule applies to smaller temples of goddesses popularly worshipped during Dashain. No Dalit was allowed to worship inside the temple in my village in northern Gorkha. The local upper castes rejected Dalit’s legal right to practise their religion on the grounds that the deity would be offended by physical contact with a lower caste. When angry, the fearsome and vengeful goddess could cause death and destruction in the community. What do you expect when people are blatantly discriminated against in the house of God? People would find it only natural to segregate Dalits in their homes, villages and towns. Herein lies the fundamental cause of the persistent caste domination, humiliation and violence across the country. Dashain is also guilty regarding its traditional political economy, namely the patron-client system. This system is highly exploitative and humiliating. Dalits are required to serve upper-caste people with their traditional skills throughout generations for little return. During festivals like Dashain, these tailors, blacksmiths and shoemakers visit their clients’ homes and eat and drink there. Dalit patrons aren’t allowed to enter the homes and eat outside separately. They cannot touch the water taps and must do their dishes. To humiliate them further, they are offered the tails and neck bones of the animals slaughtered for the Dashain celebrations. Way forward It’s not possible to describe here the many other ways in which big festivities like Dashain are used to legitimise the segregation and domination of Dalits through religious/spiritual and cultural methods. The most serious problem here is that nobody seems bothered by it. Marx was probably right: Religion does seem to act like opium. This opium has dulled the senses of the masses, the rulers, and, ironically, the victims themselves. It’s time we raised our voices against such a systematic violation of constitutional and legal provisions against caste discrimination. By applying the black tika on the most auspicious day of tika during Dashain, I’m asking a serious question on behalf of ordinary Dalits to both the state and religious authorities: Does our physical touch really offend your gods and goddesses so much?If it’s the gods themselves segregating us, we have no choice but to turn to a different religion in search of different, perhaps more egalitarian, gods. If it’s the people that segregate Dalits, shouldn’t these religious people abide by the modern law of the land? Does the constitution and law become null and void during religious rituals?  ","summary":"Many Nepalis may still be in a holiday mood as Dashain, the country’s most significant Hindu festival with the longest holiday, is just over.

The India Employment Report 2024 highlights that young people between the ages of 15 to 29 account for almost 83 percent of all unemployed people in India. Of these, nearly all are considered “educated unemployed”, having either had a secondary or tertiary education.Youth job participation is low, especially among women, with approximately 33.4 million women engaging in paid work in 2022. Around seven to eight million young people are projected to be added to the workforce every year, yet there are not enough dignified jobs. About 115 million more jobs are estimated to be needed by 2030 to absorb both underutilised workers and the incoming labour force. For those who do find employment, jobs are frequently informal, low-paying and may not match people’s qualifications, leading to disguised underemployment where their skills are underutilised.In all these cases, young people are unable to secure their goal of resilient and dignified livelihoods—jobs that are not vulnerable to automation and offer potential for socioeconomic growth, rather than maintaining the status quo based on class/caste/gender, such as delivery workers or domestic work.An education failureOne thing is clear: India’s education system has failed to prepare them for their future employment. A recent study with 35,000 young people aged 14 to 18 years across India revealed that while young people remain in school longer compared to 2017, there does not seem to have been much change in their foundational literacy and numeracy skills compared to earlier generations. In some instances they’re even going backwards. For example, 76.6 percent of 14 to 18-year-olds in 2017 could read a Std II level text compared to 73.6 percent in 2023.The emphasis on rote learning rather than foundational skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, communication and collaboration has resulted in a mismatch between the skills demanded by employers and the job readiness of youth entering the market, even those with a degree. There is a dire need to strengthen the foundational skills of Indian students to improve their job-readiness, right from their earliest years of school. And given the large number of people affected, any solutions will need to be able to be delivered across the country.To bridge this gap at scale, it is crucial to democratise access to education and training resources for students and youth. This could take the form of sparking a mass movement for hands-on education and moving away from a pedagogy that celebrates rote learning and memorisation. Leveraging recent advances in artificial intelligence can provide practical and customisable support and guidance for teachers and students at scale, and help youth be both resilient and future ready.Tech-based economyIndia is transitioning to an increasingly tech-based economy but without a clear pathway for developing more resilient job opportunities at scale. AI and automation are transforming industries, enhancing productivity but also spelling the end of more routine jobs. This uncertainty makes it critical that young people have strong skills to be able to re-learn and pivot in response to a changing market.Manufacturing, healthcare and agriculture in India require a workforce that can update and adapt its skills in keeping with changing tools and technologies. Giving youth strong foundational knowledge in STEAM subjects—science, technology, engineering, arts and maths—as well as specific skills in AI and robotics, will be crucial to them successfully navigating this shift.This calls for a fundamental shift in the way teaching and learning takes place in classrooms at all levels: K-12, higher education, vocational and beyond.Shifting educational practicesA culture of hands-on learning is being introduced in some classrooms in response. This involves learners collaborating on making, breaking and remixing materials and ideas so that they are strengthening their abilities to engage in problem-solving, connect interdisciplinary ideas and develop foundational critical thinking skills associated with the subjects they are otherwise passively reading.Organisations such as MakerGhat offer a transformative educational model designed to equip students with essential foundational skills such as problem-solving, confidence in their own abilities, critical thinking and collaborative communication, particularly in relation to STEAM topics. This approach leverages the power of hands-on making and tinkering.Most recently an AI large language model-powered solution nicknamed MakerDost has been introduced to shape how teachers and students engage in learning. MakerDost, a WhatsApp chatbot launched earlier this year, is designed to support hands-on learning for both teachers and students. For young learners, the programme offers activities aimed at building critical thinking, problem-solving, communication and collaboration skills. It also facilitates self-evaluation, provides skill certifications and offers exposure to emerging technologies. For teachers, the programme delivers syllabus-aligned, easy-to-execute lesson plans, customised for local context and language.The AI delivers in-situ educational content and nudges to the instructor, enabling them to be a better teacher and delivers custom learning pathways to the learner to enable them to adapt and pick up new skills in real time. Additionally, teachers benefit from extensive training and certification in experiential learning methods, receive in-class support and performance feedback and gain access to a community for sharing resources, tips and expert advice from seasoned makers.This approach is not without its challenges. It entails having basic access to mobile phones and the internet, and basic digital literacy. While the chatbot aims to support diverse languages, it depends on data being available for those languages. To ensure equitable access to resilient and dignified livelihoods, technology must be an integral part of strengthening capacity-building efforts and culture change at every level of the education system.Augment, not replaceSuch technology solutions seek to augment, but not replace, teachers or in-person capacity-building support. Ultimately, the aim of these solutions is to revitalise public infrastructure at the college, vocational (such as industrial training institutes and polytechnics) and school levels (through low-cost maker kits and Atal Tinkering Labs) to better prepare students for their future careers.An integral part of any AI deployment in the classroom should be a robust monitoring and evaluation framework, to track and assess the learning progress and skill development of students using scientific methods. By continuously monitoring educational outcomes, data-driven adjustments can be made to these programs and help understand implicit biases that may creep in. The outcome is to enhance programme and educator effectiveness while ensuring learning experiences are precisely tailored to meet the evolving needs of students. Such models are designed to be scalable and adaptable, making it suitable for implementation in diverse educational settings across the globe.The goal is to move India’s youth from being job-seekers to job-creators. In practice, this means developing a generation of youth who think critically about their lives and work, are proactive (and not reactive) to macro market conditions and changes in innovation, and are resilient lifelong learners who can always pick up new skills on-demand, anytime. This also means developing a cohort of entrepreneurs from and building products for the most underrepresented communities across the country.This nationwide movement-building effort can be a very practical reality within the next decade in India. It will require the development of rigorous research-backed pathways to evaluate and integrate generative AI tools that are foundationally designed to augment, sustain and amplify core human agency. This can both improve the agency of teachers in becoming better and more capable classroom facilitators and students in becoming better equipped at navigating complex and evolving career pathways in response to a changing labour market.-360info ","summary":"India is facing an employability crisis.

For those who do find employment, jobs are frequently informal, low-paying and may not match people’s qualifications, leading to disguised underemployment where their skills are underutilised.In all these cases, young people are unable to secure their goal of resilient and dignified livelihoods—jobs that are not vulnerable to automation and offer potential for socioeconomic growth, rather than maintaining the status quo based on class/caste/gender, such as delivery workers or domestic work.An education failureOne thing is clear: India’s education system has failed to prepare them for their future employment. A recent study with 35,000 young people aged 14 to 18 years across India revealed that while young people remain in school longer compared to 2017, there does not seem to have been much change in their foundational literacy and numeracy skills compared to earlier generations. In some instances they’re even going backwards. For example, 76.6 percent of 14 to 18-year-olds in 2017 could read a Std II level text compared to 73.6 percent in 2023.The emphasis on rote learning rather than foundational skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, communication and collaboration has resulted in a mismatch between the skills demanded by employers and the job readiness of youth entering the market, even those with a degree. There is a dire need to strengthen the foundational skills of Indian students to improve their job-readiness, right from their earliest years of school. And given the large number of people affected, any solutions will need to be able to be delivered across the country.To bridge this gap at scale, it is crucial to democratise access to education and training resources for students and youth. This could take the form of sparking a mass movement for hands-on education and moving away from a pedagogy that celebrates rote learning and memorisation. Leveraging recent advances in artificial intelligence can provide practical and customisable support and guidance for teachers and students at scale, and help youth be both resilient and future ready.Tech-based economyIndia is transitioning to an increasingly tech-based economy but without a clear pathway for developing more resilient job opportunities at scale. AI and automation are transforming industries, enhancing productivity but also spelling the end of more routine jobs. This uncertainty makes it critical that young people have strong skills to be able to re-learn and pivot in response to a changing market.Manufacturing, healthcare and agriculture in India require a workforce that can update and adapt its skills in keeping with changing tools and technologies. Giving youth strong foundational knowledge in STEAM subjects—science, technology, engineering, arts and maths—as well as specific skills in AI and robotics, will be crucial to them successfully navigating this shift.This calls for a fundamental shift in the way teaching and learning takes place in classrooms at all levels: K-12, higher education, vocational and beyond.Shifting educational practicesA culture of hands-on learning is being introduced in some classrooms in response. This involves learners collaborating on making, breaking and remixing materials and ideas so that they are strengthening their abilities to engage in problem-solving, connect interdisciplinary ideas and develop foundational critical thinking skills associated with the subjects they are otherwise passively reading.Organisations such as MakerGhat offer a transformative educational model designed to equip students with essential foundational skills such as problem-solving, confidence in their own abilities, critical thinking and collaborative communication, particularly in relation to STEAM topics. This approach leverages the power of hands-on making and tinkering.Most recently an AI large language model-powered solution nicknamed MakerDost has been introduced to shape how teachers and students engage in learning. MakerDost, a WhatsApp chatbot launched earlier this year, is designed to support hands-on learning for both teachers and students. For young learners, the programme offers activities aimed at building critical thinking, problem-solving, communication and collaboration skills. It also facilitates self-evaluation, provides skill certifications and offers exposure to emerging technologies. For teachers, the programme delivers syllabus-aligned, easy-to-execute lesson plans, customised for local context and language.The AI delivers in-situ educational content and nudges to the instructor, enabling them to be a better teacher and delivers custom learning pathways to the learner to enable them to adapt and pick up new skills in real time. Additionally, teachers benefit from extensive training and certification in experiential learning methods, receive in-class support and performance feedback and gain access to a community for sharing resources, tips and expert advice from seasoned makers.This approach is not without its challenges. It entails having basic access to mobile phones and the internet, and basic digital literacy. While the chatbot aims to support diverse languages, it depends on data being available for those languages. To ensure equitable access to resilient and dignified livelihoods, technology must be an integral part of strengthening capacity-building efforts and culture change at every level of the education system.Augment, not replaceSuch technology solutions seek to augment, but not replace, teachers or in-person capacity-building support. Ultimately, the aim of these solutions is to revitalise public infrastructure at the college, vocational (such as industrial training institutes and polytechnics) and school levels (through low-cost maker kits and Atal Tinkering Labs) to better prepare students for their future careers.An integral part of any AI deployment in the classroom should be a robust monitoring and evaluation framework, to track and assess the learning progress and skill development of students using scientific methods. By continuously monitoring educational outcomes, data-driven adjustments can be made to these programs and help understand implicit biases that may creep in. The outcome is to enhance programme and educator effectiveness while ensuring learning experiences are precisely tailored to meet the evolving needs of students. Such models are designed to be scalable and adaptable, making it suitable for implementation in diverse educational settings across the globe.The goal is to move India’s youth from being job-seekers to job-creators. In practice, this means developing a generation of youth who think critically about their lives and work, are proactive (and not reactive) to macro market conditions and changes in innovation, and are resilient lifelong learners who can always pick up new skills on-demand, anytime. This also means developing a cohort of entrepreneurs from and building products for the most underrepresented communities across the country.This nationwide movement-building effort can be a very practical reality within the next decade in India. It will require the development of rigorous research-backed pathways to evaluate and integrate generative AI tools that are foundationally designed to augment, sustain and amplify core human agency. This can both improve the agency of teachers in becoming better and more capable classroom facilitators and students in becoming better equipped at navigating complex and evolving career pathways in response to a changing labour market.-360info "},{"hash":"31692bb4df66a7f8ab36ce4cf6128464a1d52cd3be18575226cda6430ff04bc1","title":"stocks-crave-right-policy-not-politics","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/10/27/stocks-crave-right-policy-not-politics","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/leadshutterstock1-1730039117.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1729987200000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"Banking and financial institutions’ margin loans for equities shot up 9 percent from mid-August to mid-September. The Rs 8.3-billion increase brings the total to Rs99.7 billion. In the prior month (mid-July to mid-August), these loans grew by Rs1.3 billion. At the end of the last fiscal year through mid-July this year, they stood at Rs90.1 billion. Banks are wallowing in excess liquidity, and interest rates are meaningfully lower from just a few months ago. More importantly, the latest surge in margin loans follows an expansionary policy adopted by the monetary policy for the fiscal year 2024-25, which, among others, scrapped the Rs200-million margin-loan cap for institutional investors. The Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank, tightened the margin-loan policy three years ago when the 2021-22 monetary policy limited margin loan per customer to Rs40 million at one bank and Rs120 million at multiple banks. Investor speculation was rampant back then. The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE), the only stock exchange in the country, rallied from 1,099 in March 2019 to 3,227 in August 2021, before tumbling 44 percent to 1,807 by June 2022. Fast forward to now, and the NEPSE closed at 2,568 on July 25, the session before the latest monetary policy was announced. By August 18, it hit 3,048 and reversed lower, touching 2,443 on September 29. The index closed at 2,618 on Sunday.Bishnu Poudel, the current Finance Minister, has an enviable reputation for stock-market performance during his prior three stints, with the NEPSE up 69 percent between November 4, 2015 and August 1, 2016, up 82 percent between October 13, 2020 and July 12, 2021 and up 8 percent between December 22, 2022 and February 27, 2023. It seems he earnestly wants this unbroken streak to continue as his legacy. Poudel began his fourth stint as finance minister on July 15; a day ago, the NEPSE closed at 2,258. On September 18, he showed up unannounced at NEPSE headquarters, apparently seeking answers for the drop in the index from north of 3,000 to north of 2,500 within a month!Yes to long-term focus; no to gimmicksIf this conduct by a finance minister looks like cheap populism, it is exactly that. First, the NEPSE management wields no control over the direction of the index. It is instead dictated by the buy and sell orders of bullish and bearish investors/traders, who, for the most part, are, and should be, driven by the economy’s prospects, thereby company earnings—or a lack thereof. Second, news of Poudel’s appointment as finance minister had raised investor hopes that there would be prompt improvement on the regulatory front, including the appointment of chairman of the Securities Board of Nepal, which regulates the securities market in Nepal; the post has remained vacant since January this year. If Poudel’s visit to the NEPSE trading floor was a ploy to message the embittered investors that he is on the case and has their back, this can only be considered immature. A finance minister cannot be this preoccupied with an equity index, which has its own rhythms and tends to move in cycles—near- to, medium- to long-term. It is not rocket science, but securities—be it fixed income, currency, equities, or what have you—do not always go up. They cannot possibly. Poudel is a politician. Politicians—most anyway—have their eyes on the next election cycle. Hence they miss no opportunity to please voters, but it is responsible to follow the proper do’s and don’ts. As finance minister, Poudel will do himself a big favour if he focuses more on the long term and less on gimmicks. This is what will ensure him an enduring legacy. The NEPSE, having opened for trading in January 1994, is relatively young. Its market cap has gone from millions to trillions in three decades, yet it lacks even the most basic investing tools. Forget derivatives such as options and futures, which are not traded there, it is still not possible to short a NEPSE-listed stock. In shorting, borrowed shares are sold, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price. This involves an entirely different skill set and should lead to a balanced market, as in any given asset sometimes bulls are right, sometimes shorts.Stocks go up, and they go down It is unhealthy to only wish for upward bias. Unfortunately for Nepal’s stock market, that is the case, as, for instance, bears are denied an opportunity to butt heads with bulls. The problem gets exacerbated when regulators and concerned authorities such as Poudel routinely telegraph that they want higher prices, as was evident in his visit to the NEPSE headquarters. The recent change in margin-loan policy probably falls into the same bucket; the idea was to induce risk-on behaviour, and that happened. Here is the irony. The NEPSE jumped 34 percent from mid-July to mid-August and fell 14 percent the next month, even as borrowing took off. Those using leverage to go long are left holding the bag. Tweaking policy with a desire to push prices up may yield results in the short term, but this hardly helps if the aim is to graduate from an emerging to developed market someday. The sad truth is that when markets are under pressure, the human tendency to play the blame game holds true in all markets. The US banned short selling of financial stocks in September 2008 when they were in freefall, but they kept falling. A similar thing happened in several European countries in August 2011. For two years now, Chinese authorities have rolled out measures designed to breathe new life into real estate and stocks, but the Shanghai Composite Index continues to trade materially lower from its prior highs.Except for shorts, not a soul complains when an asset bubble is forming. But when markets are in crisis, they all get panicky, at times leading to absurd courses of action by the authorities. Developed markets can get away with this because they have gotten the scale—a go-to place for global investors. Emerging markets like Nepal are different. Here, as tempting as it is to wish for ever higher prices myopically, the solution does not lie there but rather in measures to lay the proper foundation, which, among others, is made up of as many tools as possible so that both bulls and bears get efficient.

He again accused the Oli government of protecting the corrupt while selectively targeting opposition leaders for prosecution. Dahal re-emphasised how his government was toppled because it was preparing to take action against top Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders on corruption charges. Dahal and other top Maoist leaders who spoke before him lamented the ‘complete failure’ of the Oli government’s 100 days in office. Perhaps the most interesting part of Dahal’s statement was that the ruling parties need not fear that the Maoist Centre would try to topple the government. In fact, the party was now in a soul-searching phase and there was no question of the Maoists joining the government soon. That the Maoist supremo managed to say all this with a perfectly straight face speaks volumes about his chameleon-like ability to deceive folks—or at least about his belief that he can continue to do so indefinitely. His harangue on Saturday made one thing clear though: He still feels deeply hurt by the ‘deceit’ of KP Sharma Oli who ditched him to join hands with the Congress in order to cobble together a new ruling coalition. Nevermind that there is perhaps no one better at the deceit game than Dahal, who only four months ago used to publicly boast of the ‘magic number’ he had to be a long-term prime minister, apparently by endlessly playing off the Congress and the UML against each other. As Dahal held forth on Saturday, the pain of unexpectedly being booted out of office was also pasted all over his face. If Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba or UML chair Oli offered him to be the prime minister again, he would accept the offer in a heartbeat. No one is fooled by his commitment to soul-searching. He has played that card before. Even when he became the prime minister for the third time back in December 2022, he had promised to learn from his past mistakes and this time train all his focus on good governance and service delivery. Yet when we look back at his year and half of premiership, there is little to show for it.It is nothing but self-deception if Dahal believes people still heed his public utterances. Nothing he said on Saturday will change the public perception that Dahal is an ace manipulator whose sole goal is to connive his way back to power. Otherwise, it is hard to see how the Maoists can make a political comeback. Dahal continues to run the party like a personal fief. His successor as party chair is nowhere in sight. The party’s popular base continues to shrink and on current course, the outfit might be obliterated in the next election cycle. When the Maoist leader thundered from Tundikhel in the past, a sizable section of farmers, labourers, daily wage earners and all those who yearned for a break with the past paid some attention. Unlike the ‘bourgeois’ Congress and UML, the Maoists, with some justification, claimed to have championed the cause of the downtrodden. Now the very proposition sounds laughable. The Maoist Centre these days is a party without a core ideology or stable support base. With Dahal uninterested in putting in the hard work to gradually rebuild the organisation while champing at the bit to get back into Singhadurbar, the Maoists’ downslide will be hard to halt.  ","summary":"While addressing party workers in Kathmandu on Saturday, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, chairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre), the main opposition, stuck to a familiar script.

No sooner had the devastating monsoon rains left Nepali skies than the dry weather started. Those who had gone to their homes to celebrate the biggest festival, Dashain, have returned to cities, as have vehicles, contributing to the rising carbon monoxide levels. Farmers who have finished their seasonal harvest have piled up stubble on their farms to be burned openly. In a matter of days, thick haze and smoke coming from vehicles and farms will blanket the country, including the capital, Kathmandu, which has seen a worsening air quality in recent years. But the problem is by no means limited to Kathmandu.Stubble burning presents a bigger problem than imagined. In Nepal’s Tarai belt, burning harvest residues has become common and has only increased in recent years. A report from 2020, “A model-ready emission inventory for crop residue open burning in the context of Nepal,” shows how farmers’ increasing use of modern agricultural machines like combine harvesters contributes to increasing emissions. These machines save farmers’ time but leave plenty of residue behind. The general public and farmers are yet to internalise how their negligence is contributing to air pollution in the country, endangering lives, including their own. This has affected the vulnerable elderly and children the most; people of other ages are also facing health issues like pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems. Every year, particulate matter pollution takes the lives of 40,000 people in Nepal. Yet the public and government continue to pay scant attention to the issue. Smog also drifts to our part of the sky from India, the southern neighbour. Stubble burning is rampant in the country’s breadbasket states of Punjab and Haryana. This year alone, 22 stubble-burning complaints have been made to the police in Haryana, as per Reuters. No matter how hard these states have tried to put a lid on the problem by arresting farmers responsible for poor air, Delhi’s air is already becoming dangerous. Kathmandu’s air quality index will likely deteriorate if instances of stubble burning increase both at home and in India. Already on Wednesday, Chitwan, a city around 170 km southwest of Kathmandu, fared even worse than the national capital, with an AQI of 150.To address this crisis, farmers should be encouraged and sensitised to use climate-smart technologies, including modified combine harvesters and reaper harvesters, and taught about alternative uses of residues, like feeding them to animals, livestock rearing, and making biodegradable waste. Lighting them up should be the last resort. If these methods don’t work, the government can also punish repeat offenders through strict legal action. Cross-border climate diplomacy also needs to be ramped up—this has really become indispensable as climate change respects no borders. With the impending danger of air pollution, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, in collaboration with other federal stakeholders, has geared up to mitigate the problem this year through smoke metres, which detect vehicle emissions. But this is not enough. Again, the country should be able to control open burning and punish those involved in it. For this, the federal government must come up with a long-term plan. Other local units, particularly those with rampant stubble burning, must also step up to the plate. The problem is air pollution is too serious and too urgent to put off for another day.  ","summary":"The gloomy days are upon us again.

The problem is air pollution is too serious and too urgent to put off for another day.  "},{"hash":"dc0cf47429fc4acffa34418d9f1f087a589c57f797a23917886282278da69263","title":"oli-s-autocratic-bent","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/10/23/oli-s-autocratic-bent","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/postfilrphoto-1729698825.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1729641600000,"source":"kp","category":"editorial","content":"By trying to silence his critics in the party, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who is also chairman of the CPN-UML, has again shown his autocratic character.

He resigned from the position in 2009, after which he dedicated himself in the study of national and international politics. The Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed him to serve on several high-level panels—for Bangladesh’s 2008 parliamentary elections and for South Sudan’s referendum process in 2010-11. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Pokharel to better understand Nepal’s own electoral system and the influence of big business on its political parties.The latest episode of Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land to CPN-UML and his announcement of a sophisticated party office building at the land has of late been a topic of hot debate. People see this as an example of how politicians and businessmen work in collusion. How do you see it?Our legal provisions in this connection have some loopholes. The law allows political parties to collect donations to run their organisations, to contest elections and to carry out other activities. The law is silent on who can make such donations and how much they can do it. This is a gap in our law. Our political parties have for long been misusing the loopholes, and now they are doing so openly. The laws have also identified some sources of income for the parties such as the levy by their members, donations they get and the incomes the parties make in various ways. The amount they earn from these sources is negligible. But most major corruption cases, and mainly policy-related corruption, are linked to those who fund the political parties. This in turn is linked to the trend of elections increasingly becoming expensive. Politicians need money and those with money need access to powerful politicians. So, this is mutually beneficial for politicians and businesspeople. Such activities have been taking place for decades, but the level of such collusion has increased significantly of late.Is accepting donations from Gurung problematic as there are pending corruption and fraud cases against him or is accepting donations from business people inherently questionable?Our law hasn’t set clear criteria in this connection. Laws in some countries have categorically defined certain fundamental things such as from whom parties can take donations, how much and what type of money they can accept and how to make the deal transparent. In developed democracies, political financing is strictly monitored and regulated. In our case, we didn’t even fix the limit of the amount a businessperson can donate to a political party and whether that should be linked to the profit and tax the person pays to the state. Even the individuals who haven’t paid tax to the state citing losses in their businesses might be donating big sums to political parties or individual politicians. Therefore, there should be certain criteria to regulate political financing. Certain provisions empower the Election Commission to take action. For instance, if someone wants to help a political party or a candidate financially with more than Rs25,000, the person has to give the money through a bank. The commission can cancel someone’s candidacy or take other actions if the candidate is found to have made excessive expenses in breach of election laws. But our agencies are weak in terms of enforcement. The political parties submit the details of their financial transactions but that is often audited by a chartered accountant who might be a party cadre. The Election Commission hasn’t succeeded in investigating such malpractices. Will a law on conflict of interest help control such malpractices?We need a couple of things soon. First, the state should formulate and enforce a law on conflict of interest. It will define certain issues on conflict of interest involving politicians, business people and other stakeholders and make the officials making decisions accountable. Second, there is a need to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t. Of late, there is tendency of making decisions from Cabinet meetings to avoid prosecution from the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) as the anti-corruption body is not allowed to investigate Cabinet’s policy decisions. The CIAA leadership has an excuse not to get involved in the decisions of the politicians who appoint them. All Cabinet decisions are not policy decisions. So, it has become urgent to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t and what kind of issues the CIAA and other investigating agencies can investigate.People in general say that corruption has of late increased. Is that the case?There is no society completely free of corruption. I have been observing the functioning of our state mechanisms for the past five decades. During the Panchayat [1960-1990], everything was controlled by the palace. And, the royals and their kin were linked when there was a high-level corruption case. In the 1980s, a corruption case involving the procurement of a Boeing surfaced. A commission led by a Supreme Court justice showed the involvement of prince Gyanendra [who later became King] but its report was not implemented as the then King Birendra didn’t muster the courage to take action against his own brother. At the time, politicians didn’t dare to get involved in serious corruption cases as there was a fear of action from the palace. Over time, the volume of corruption increased with the increment in the amount of financial transactions. There is corruption even in countries like Japan and South Korea that have made exemplary progress in development. Leaders including prime ministers, ministers have been prosecuted and even faced jail terms on corruption charges. Based on that, some argue that corruption is somehow attached to development because there is mobilisation of huge resources. But there is a big difference with what is happening here. There, they take action against whoever is involved. Presidents and prime ministers have been jailed, some have even committed suicide. But in our case, top political leadership is not prosecuted. The other aspect is that after the reinstatement of democracy and the start of the republican order, the media made more corruption cases public, which was not the case during the King’s regime.Do you see any connection between the political parties and the rampant corruption in recent decades?Our party organisations became too burdensome. In developed democracies, political parties become active when there is a need for their role. At other times, they go ‘into hibernation’. The party leaders and members return to their regular businesses and remain busy there. For instance, at present, the Democrats and Republicans in the US have concentrated all their energy to help their respective candidates win. Once the election is over, they return to their regular businesses. Similar is the situation in other developed democracies. This happens when a democracy attains maturity. Conversely, in our case, the cadres are totally dependent on their organisations. And even general people want things done through party channels. From the grassroots to the centre, people go to party offices for recommendations to get something done from government agencies. This is how parties have become parallel power centres to the state agencies. The government bodies have been weakened. Hence, the way our political organisations, their leaders and cadres are managed has become the source of corruption. And it has weakened elected governments because they aren’t allowed to work independently. Government officials are also forced to work as per the order given by a head of the local chapter of a political party, not by the elected representatives with people’s mandate.There is another more concerning trend. These days the government’s decisions are influenced by certain interest groups that have huge money. There are around two dozen big business houses who influence the state’s decision-making process no matter which party leads the government. First they make informal decisions on certain key issues. Then, the Parliament, a government agency, or a court, whichever is concerned, endorses it. So now the real power doesn’t lie with elected representatives or state agencies. The interest groups wield real power.How to stop it?The state should fund political parties to cover their genuine expenses such as election expenditures and regular costs needed to run party organisations. This helps break the nexus between politicians and business tycoons and to check corruption. Once the political parties get money from state coffers, their expenditures will be strictly regulated by the law. They won’t be allowed to take outside donations. After that, the Office of the Auditor General will audit their accounts.But how can we ensure the parties and their leaders are taking no donations even after they get state funding?The law will bar both the donors and recipients from being involved in offering and taking donations. Then, the donors can say that they can’t give money to the political parties as that will be a crime of breaching the law. The policy only works if the state agencies strongly enforce the law.Other countries have made huge progress in terms of development despite corruption being rampant there. Why do we lag behind?We adopted the form of governance that accepts Parliament as the most sovereign body. But, in reality, the power lies with the chiefs of three major parties. The Parliament rubber stamps whatever they decide. And, they are influenced by certain interest groups. The legislature seeks political parties’ decisions even to follow its procedures. The other most powerful institution as per our constitution is the prime minister. But, in reality, the prime minister always struggles to appease coalition partners. Another important state pillar is the judiciary, which has been weakened by politicisation. Constitutional bodies could have played an important check and balance role but the politicians wanted to use them to serve their interests. With the weakening and non-functioning of state agencies, misrule prevails. In other countries, laws and state agencies work, and therefore they progressed.Is there a viable way to clean up our corrupt system? First the leaders that messed things up and brought the country to this situation should retire. The leaders who led historic political movements have failed to maintain their height. The narrative of ‘there is no hope’ has spread. This will not stop unless the present leadership retires. Things will improve if they voluntarily retire from politics. But they aren’t ready for that.How do you evaluate the present government’s performance after its 100 days in office?I was optimistic at the beginning and expected that they would work differently and instil hope in the people, mainly on good governance. But they gave continuity to the same mistakes they committed in the past. As the two largest parties are in the government, they have a chance to sow hope in the country, but the signs in the past 100 days aren’t encouraging. They deserve credit for the initiative to amend transitional justice related laws and to begin the process to constitute the two TJ bodies. Also, the government successfully restored connection of the Kathmandu Valley with other parts of the country after the devastating floods and landslides.Our major concern is that if this experiment of a government of two largest parties fails, it will raise questions over our system. It won’t be limited to the failure of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, it will be projected as a failure of the system. A number of groups are unhappy with the system the present constitution adopted in 2015. The governing parties’ failure will give them a ground to raise questions over the system, at a time when a large section of the society is fed up with seeing “the same old faces”. Individual leaders’ failure may push our democratic system in a crisis. This is more concerning. At the time of forming this coalition, they said that they joined hands due to the special circumstances of the country. But they didn’t work as per the special needs.You wrote a book entitled Preventing Election Violence Through Diplomacy in 2020 after a comprehensive research on some African countries. Do you see any similarities between politics of Africa and Nepal?In the course of that research, I studied some elected as well as non-elected dictators in Africa and Latin America. The dictators always think along the lines of ‘me and mine’. Instead of strengthening state agencies, they want to turn the agencies in their favour. Over time, some dictators realise they are making one mistake after another and they reach a point where they want to quit. But the coterie that surrounds the leader doesn’t allow him or her to quit. Those who are benefitting from the rule even threaten to kill the dictator if he/she plans to call it quits. Then, the dictators want some external intervention, beyond the tight circle. I found such circumstances in my case studies. It is so unfortunate that I see something similar happening in Nepal. The way a group of people encircle our top leaders and defend even their wrongdoings, it gives me a feeling of deja vu. In our case, some leaders are advised not to quit as a true successor has not been groomed.  ","summary":"Former chief election commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel successfully conducted the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008.

He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isn’t possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the country’s largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oli’s acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We can’t say anything about the government agencies’ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies can’t enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSP’s concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperatives’ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhane’s case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepal’s development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal can’t progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them weren’t built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people aren’t brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individuals’ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies can’t take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai—were not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers weren’t prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the party’s transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our party’s agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesn’t mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party can’t accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our party’s present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance. ","summary":"During his term as home minister in the previous Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government that was toppled in mid-July, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who is also senior vice-chair of the CPN (Maoist Centre), undertook some bold actions. He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand.

At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies. ","summary":"Central and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies.

Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. ","summary":"Nepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back.

The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority. ","summary":"The parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate cooperatives scam submitted its report last week. The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director.
