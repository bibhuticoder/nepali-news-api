When it comes to gender equality, cryosphere science in particular continues to lag behind other fields. Women on Ice is an important first step in addressing this stubborn imbalance.‚Äù\nMiriam Jackson, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change author and Cryosphere Lead, ICIMOD, says, ‚ÄúCryosphere changes in the Hindu Kush Himalaya hold vast implications for communities in one of the most populated places on the planet ‚Äì with many of these implications set to be felt first and most acutely by women. In this context, encouraging gender parity in the study of snow, ice and permafrost is not a ‚Äònice to have‚Äô ‚Äì it‚Äôs vital that decision making on climate change and water resource management is inclusive and considers the needs of all sections of societies.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crucial at this moment that we create more opportunities for women to shape the academic discourse, and provide pathways for them to influence policy, and drive solutions. I wish this scheme had existed when I was a young female scientist, taking my first steps into a hugely male-dominated field.‚Äù\nPema Gyamtsho, Director General of ICIMOD, says, ‚ÄúWe are very excited to launch this new initiative as part of our commitment to gender equality and social inclusion. Our hope is that Women on Ice will be catalytic ‚Äì not just forging a network of new female scientists, but also inspiring and encouraging more girls to pursue careers in science by highlighting the huge range of opportunities that exist in these realms. Having more women in science will underpin a more resilient and dynamic scientific community, which leads to a more sustainable and equitable future.‚Äù\nThe expedition, from 2-13 December, will include two mountaineering guides, a doctor, and four ICIMOD experts. All participants will go through a medical check to be declared medically fit to undertake the expedition by an accredited hospital, and must be willing to undertake a difficult hike and work under challenging conditions.\nTo learn more and to apply head to: https://www.icimod.org/event/cryosphere-water/hkh-women-on-ice/\nAbout ICIMOD\nThe Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region stretches 3,500km across Asia, spanning eight countries ‚Äì Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan.

When it comes to gender equality, cryosphere science in particular continues to lag behind other fields. Women on Ice is an important first step in addressing this stubborn imbalance.‚Äù\nMiriam Jackson, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change author and Cryosphere Lead, ICIMOD, says, ‚ÄúCryosphere changes in the Hindu Kush Himalaya hold vast implications for communities in one of the most populated places on the planet ‚Äì with many of these implications set to be felt first and most acutely by women. In this context, encouraging gender parity in the study of snow, ice and permafrost is not a ‚Äònice to have‚Äô ‚Äì it‚Äôs vital that decision making on climate change and water resource management is inclusive and considers the needs of all sections of societies.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crucial at this moment that we create more opportunities for women to shape the academic discourse, and provide pathways for them to influence policy, and drive solutions. I wish this scheme had existed when I was a young female scientist, taking my first steps into a hugely male-dominated field.‚Äù\nPema Gyamtsho, Director General of ICIMOD, says, ‚ÄúWe are very excited to launch this new initiative as part of our commitment to gender equality and social inclusion. Our hope is that Women on Ice will be catalytic ‚Äì not just forging a network of new female scientists, but also inspiring and encouraging more girls to pursue careers in science by highlighting the huge range of opportunities that exist in these realms. Having more women in science will underpin a more resilient and dynamic scientific community, which leads to a more sustainable and equitable future.‚Äù\nThe expedition, from 2-13 December, will include two mountaineering guides, a doctor, and four ICIMOD experts. All participants will go through a medical check to be declared medically fit to undertake the expedition by an accredited hospital, and must be willing to undertake a difficult hike and work under challenging conditions.\nTo learn more and to apply head to: https://www.icimod.org/event/cryosphere-water/hkh-women-on-ice/\nAbout ICIMOD\nThe Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region stretches 3,500km across Asia, spanning eight countries ‚Äì Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan.

The team also reached Nagma Mali‚Äôs house to inquire about the whereabouts of her father. Nandagopal Mali, who was arrested by the security forces, has been missing since June 22, 2004.‚ÄúI was not home when the police arrived. Later they called to ask if I had any updates on my father,\" she told the Post. \"It came as a shock and I suspect the police have taken up the issue as the transitional justice commissions remain defunct. It is a worrying sign if true.\"Victims‚Äô rights advocates say the police who went door to door on Monday claimed to have received a circular from the Police Headquarters to study the situation.\"The victims have reported that the police who visited their place said they were doing their job as directed by the central office,\" Suman Adhikari, founding chairperson of the Conflict Victims Common Platform, told the Post. \"What is the government trying to do by mobilising the security agency to look into war-era cases while keeping the transitional justice commissions defunct?‚ÄùThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission for the Investigation of Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP) have been paralysed since July 2022, after the government decided to extend their terms without retaining their chairmen and members. The CIEDP has the responsibility to investigate the cases of enforced disappearances. Against the government‚Äôs claim that the bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act would be endorsed by October 2022 and open the door for recruiting new office bearers, there has been no progress even after two years. The government has already given four extensions to the two commissions in two years.Through its last Cabinet meeting, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government on July 19 extended their terms by another year. However, it is still unsure when the Act gets amended and the defunct commissions get their office bearers. The government employees deployed to the commissions lack authority to conduct works other than day-to-day administration.The Dahal government on April 12 had formed a committee to recommend the office bearers for the two commissions. However, it is yet to hold its first meeting as the National Human Rights Commission has refused to send its representatives until there is commitment from the government and the political parties to endorse the amendment.‚ÄúRather than using intimidation tactics by mobilising the police, the government should work towards a proper revision in the Act and ensuring that the two commissions become functional,‚Äù said Adhikari.Nepal Police, however, denied having issued any such circular recently. ‚ÄúFinding the missing persons is our job, which we always do. However, there has been no circular to subordinate offices to carry out inquiries targeting the missing people from the conflict time,‚ÄùDan Bahadur Karki, the Nepal Police spokesperson, told the Post. ‚ÄúThere are separate commissions to look into these matters.‚ÄùThe commissions were formed in February 2015 with a two-year deadline to investigate cases of atrocities committed during the war. But nine years since, their terms have been extended for around 10 times without any tangible results.The commission on disappearances got a total of 3,223 complaints. However, it has shortlisted only 2,506 cases for investigation after a study that the other complaints did not fall within its jurisdiction.

Nandagopal Mali, who was arrested by the security forces, has been missing since June 22, 2004.‚ÄúI was not home when the police arrived. Later they called to ask if I had any updates on my father,\" she told the Post. \"It came as a shock and I suspect the police have taken up the issue as the transitional justice commissions remain defunct. It is a worrying sign if true.\"Victims‚Äô rights advocates say the police who went door to door on Monday claimed to have received a circular from the Police Headquarters to study the situation.\"The victims have reported that the police who visited their place said they were doing their job as directed by the central office,\" Suman Adhikari, founding chairperson of the Conflict Victims Common Platform, told the Post. \"What is the government trying to do by mobilising the security agency to look into war-era cases while keeping the transitional justice commissions defunct?‚ÄùThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission for the Investigation of Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP) have been paralysed since July 2022, after the government decided to extend their terms without retaining their chairmen and members. The CIEDP has the responsibility to investigate the cases of enforced disappearances. Against the government‚Äôs claim that the bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act would be endorsed by October 2022 and open the door for recruiting new office bearers, there has been no progress even after two years. The government has already given four extensions to the two commissions in two years.Through its last Cabinet meeting, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government on July 19 extended their terms by another year. However, it is still unsure when the Act gets amended and the defunct commissions get their office bearers. The government employees deployed to the commissions lack authority to conduct works other than day-to-day administration.The Dahal government on April 12 had formed a committee to recommend the office bearers for the two commissions. However, it is yet to hold its first meeting as the National Human Rights Commission has refused to send its representatives until there is commitment from the government and the political parties to endorse the amendment.‚ÄúRather than using intimidation tactics by mobilising the police, the government should work towards a proper revision in the Act and ensuring that the two commissions become functional,‚Äù said Adhikari.Nepal Police, however, denied having issued any such circular recently. ‚ÄúFinding the missing persons is our job, which we always do. However, there has been no circular to subordinate offices to carry out inquiries targeting the missing people from the conflict time,‚ÄùDan Bahadur Karki, the Nepal Police spokesperson, told the Post. ‚ÄúThere are separate commissions to look into these matters.‚ÄùThe commissions were formed in February 2015 with a two-year deadline to investigate cases of atrocities committed during the war. But nine years since, their terms have been extended for around 10 times without any tangible results.The commission on disappearances got a total of 3,223 complaints. However, it has shortlisted only 2,506 cases for investigation after a study that the other complaints did not fall within its jurisdiction.

Coming on the heels of a poor performance in the first televised live debate by his opposition presidential candidate Joe Biden, the attack has helped the controversial Republican politician consolidate his vote bank. Luckily for him, he could raise his fist and chant ‚ÄúFight, fight, fight‚Äù before being frisked away by Secret Service agents, bettering his chances of returning to the White House as undecided voters seem to buy his arguments about a plot against America. Violence against a candidate at the cusp of election only generates sympathy for them; having seen death up-close, Trump is now eyeing a resurrection of his political career.But no debate in the social media age follows the straight dichotomy of good versus evil or victim versus perpetrator. Taking cue from Trump‚Äôs own modus operandi of creating what he calls ‚Äúalternative facts,‚Äù conspiracy theorists and some of his detractors have been calling the attack a plot by Trump himself to gain public sympathy. An old photo of him, with both his ears intact, has been doing the rounds on the internet, claiming that he was not injured at all. After all, this is the same man who was indicted for instigating an attack on Capitol Hill and trying to overturn the 2020 US presidential election results. From investigating crimes by him to now investigating a crime against him, US law enforcement and investigation agencies have an unexpected, rather strange, task in their hands.But amid the din of which of the old men returns to the White House as the 47th president of the United States of America or the motive of the 20-year-old Republican voter-turned-gunman or even the misgivings about Trump‚Äôs victimhood, an age-old question of gun culture has made a comeback. American gun culture has a central role in the assassination attempt on Trump, and Trump himself is one of the fiercest defenders of such a culture. And if anyone thinks Trump will now rethink his love for guns, one of his advisers, Chris LaCivita, has clarified that the ex-president will continue to protect gun rights. For the Republicans, the constitutional guarantee offered by the Second Amendment for individuals to carry guns is sacrosanct; Trump will potentially continue to exploit the Americans‚Äô emotional attachment to the gun as a self-defense instrument.Such is the gun obsession in the United States, even after seeing the assassination of four presidents‚ÄîAbraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley and John F. Kennedy‚Äîand assassination attempts on Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W Bush, among others, the country is helpless to do much about it. The comfort of amnesia is too dear to America when it comes to dealing with the tough question of gun violence. And with a morally repugnant record of supplying arms to Israel in its attempts to wipe out the Palestinians, Trump‚Äôs opponent and sitting president Joe Biden is lost for words. The United States should really unite to wipe out gun culture.

This was when the BIMSTEC initiative slowed down, with each country having other priorities. Many saw BIMSTEC as an alternative to SAARC, as the regional organisation was revived as a cooperation vehicle in the Eastern part of South Asia. It now has a Secretary General with a Secretariat based in Dhaka and adopted a charter only recently, even though the organisation came into existence in 1997. Yet efforts are being made for regular meetings and dialogues among the officials of states to take the initiative forward and make progress on the 14 priority areas.Pushing the agenda forwardSince 2023, the BIMSTEC Foreign Ministers‚Äô retreat has become a regular event. Founded in 1997, the organisation held its fifth summit in Colombo in March 2022, where the charter was adopted after more than 20 years. This reflects the lack of commitment of member countries to take the process forward. While India sees BIMSTEC as a vehicle for its Act East policy to engage with South East Asia and as a gateway for the South Asian region, Myanmar and Thailand‚Äôs expectations are limited as they are already a part of ASEAN.

The BIMSTEC region brings together 167 billion people, incorporating 22 percent of the world population and a combined GDP of $3.71 trillion. India and BIMSTECWhile the organisation moves slowly, ironing out differences between member states to establish seamless trade and connectivity, India has prioritised BIMSTEC in its foreign policy‚Äîfrom BIMSTEC outreach in the BRICS meeting that India hosted at Goa to inviting the BIMSTEC leaders to attend the swearing-in of Prime Minister Modi‚Äôs government in 2019. India hosted the first meeting of the BIMSTEC Energy Centre governing board in Bengaluru in 2023 to suggest a road map for meaningful intra-BIMSTEC cooperation, among other issues.

It promises connectivity and access to the port in the North-East region.

It is similarly engaged with both Nepal and Bhutan to build road, rail, waterways and grid connectivity.It is speaking of the land bridge with Sri Lanka and underwater cables, as well as the restart of ferry services with Myanmar. It is engaged in the Kaladan multimodal project and has access to Sittwe Port, inaugurated in May 2023 and has been operationalised. The trilateral highway promises to link India to Thailand through Myanmar. After the Arakan Army captured the Paletwa township near the Mizoram border, the road project of nearly 110 km connecting Peletwa to Zorinpui at Mizoram will be in cold store for some time.

The pace of the summit meeting has acquired gravitas. Thailand is going to host the sixth summit in September. Given the region‚Äôs economic and trade potential, it is expected that the leaders of member countries rise to the occasion to make the cooperation in Eastern South Asia a grand success.

In his 22-member Council of Ministers, Oli picked only two women while he didn‚Äôt choose a single Dalit member. There are a few things for which even those from developed countries praise Nepal and in which we Nepalis can take great pride. The inclusive constitution of Nepal promulgated in 2015 and the laws formulated in line with the charter are quite progressive. Dalits, women and other oppressed communities fought long for their representation. But it was after the success of the people‚Äôs movement in 2006 that the enforcement of inclusive policy in state agencies started to be strengthened. And the constitution formally institutionalised the achievements of the political and other movements.Unfortunately, the spirit is gradually dying. It‚Äôs not only Oli who has ignored the call for inclusivity in his Cabinet. The same trend had been in evidence in the past. The immediate past prime minister and CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who often boasts of introducing an inclusive system in the country, didn‚Äôt appoint a single minister from the Dalit community in his last Cabinet. This is a serious concern. Having a progressive constitution and laws doesn‚Äôt mean much if the leaders in the driving seats of the executive agencies trample on its spirit. If there is a community that is most discriminated against, it is the Dalits and they therefore deserve priority for representation under an inclusive system. Worryingly, leaders not only disregard the constitutional spirit but don‚Äôt follow even minimum criteria while picking ministers, lawmakers or other officials for important posts. Aspirants for ministerial berths rather often resort to various shenanigans to impress top leaders, promoting unhealthy practices in politics. We urge the prime minister to try to correct this egregious mistake in the days ahead.The new prime minister has also stood out for something positive though. He was quick to form a full-fledged Cabinet. In the past, prime ministers would initially appoint a few ministers and take weeks, if not months, to give the Cabinet a full shape. The factional feuds within the prime minister‚Äôs party for ministerial berths and bickering between coalition partners over power sharing would frustrate the public. The heads of the government would oversee a dozen ministries, hampering the government‚Äôs functioning. Prime Minister Oli‚Äôs appointment of all his team members on the day of swearing-in means the government can function in a full-fledged way from day one. Also, in his first Cabinet meeting on Monday, Oli gave ministers specific deadlines to accomplish given tasks. Unlike in the previous Cabinets, Oli has also chosen more experienced ministers in his team.Prime Minister Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba are among the senior-most leaders who have been in power on and off since the restoration of democracy in 1990. Deuba was home minister in the first post-1990 government and Oli succeeded Deuba in 1994. They know how things work at Singhadurbar. The Congress and UML leaders have given various rationales for the coming together of the two largest parties in the federal parliament. If they can make a mark in governance and service delivery, they would have gone a long way towards fulfilling their promises.¬† "},{"hash":"0d500ec4494a5938f15ea9e7071253c4fbf0e94bc69cf6986b5755ca41b2f598","title":"apf-to-face-uzbekistan-and-malaysia-clubs-in-afc-women-s-champions-league","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/football/2024/07/18/apf-to-face-uzbekistan-and-malaysia-clubs-in-afc-women-s-champions-league","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/AWCL2024trophybackground1-1721315995.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1721260800000,"source":"kp","category":"football","content":"National Women‚Äôs League 2022 champions Armed Police Force (APF) Club have been drawn in Group C and will face Uzbekistan's FC Nasaf and Malaysia's Sabah FA in the preliminary round of the AFC Women‚Äôs Champions League.The preliminary round of the inaugural season of Asia's premier club women's football tournament will take place from August 25 to August 31.The official draw was conducted on Thursday at the AFC House.APF Club will play against Nasaf on August 25 and Sabah on August 28.

She completed her Isha Hatha Yoga teacher training in 2015 and has since dedicated her time to providing yoga classes in India and Nepal. She also volunteers at the Isha Yoga Center in Tamil Nadu, India, founded by Sadhguru. As part of Sadhguru‚Äôs foundation, Rana resonates with their mission to raise human consciousness and establish spiritual infrastructure globally, fostering spiritual growth and well-being for all. Rana is currently in Nepal and will provide Hatha yoga classes in Kupondole Heights, Sanepa, from the end of July until the end of September. In this conversation with the Post‚Äôs Sanskriti Pokharel, Rana discusses the role of books in her spiritual journey, factors that drew her towards yoga and takeaways from volunteering at the Isha yoga centre. Which books have had the most impact on your practice of yoga?As a Hatha yoga teacher and spiritual seeker, the most profound impact of yoga comes from consistent daily practice.Books have also been instrumental in offering inspiration and motivation. Some of the books which have helped me are ‚ÄòMystic Musings‚Äô by Sadhguru, ‚ÄòLife and Death‚Äô by Jiddu Krishnamurti, ‚ÄòAwareness‚Äô by Osho and ‚ÄòJonathan Livingston Seagull‚Äô by Richard Bach. Does yoga help in day-to-day life and emotional well-being? Yoga has played a tremendous role in my day-to-day life. It has helped me manage stress and anxiety. For example, if a situation upsets and angers me, my perspective completely shifts after a yoga session. As a result, I feel much more settled and balanced.What pulled you towards yoga and spirituality? Since childhood, I have been connected to prayer, chanting the Hanuman Chalisa before bed as my nightly ritual. However, in my late teenage years, I began to feel disconnected from these prayers. I wanted to understand more and uncover the science behind such chants.Nine years ago, when I aspired to go to the US to pursue my master‚Äôs, my body felt sluggish and stagnant due to a lack of physical exercise. I wanted to change that as I did not feel good in my body.The health benefits of yoga attracted me to it. Additionally, I came across marketing videos of the five-month Hatha yoga teacher training on social media, and the trainees' experiences with the teacher captivated me. I decided to start a new spiritual journey by enrolling in the Hatha yoga teacher training certified by Isha Hatha School of Yoga.After completing the transformative five-month journey, I participated in several advanced three-day programs and a more intensive seven-day Samyama silence program with Sadhguru.During the Samyama silence program, I experienced profound spiritual dimensions that touched me and revealed that life could be experienced beyond the body and mind. This realisation led me to pursue the path of a full-time spiritual seeker and dedicate my life to Sadhguru‚Äôs mission of spreading meditation and yoga worldwide.How do you counter the stream of thoughts during your sadhana practice? When I began my sadhana nine years ago, my mind was flooded with incessant thoughts, like an explosion. Today, while I still have thoughts during sadhana, they have significantly diminished, and the experience of bliss and meditation is much stronger.Because of my consistent practice, my thoughts have reduced and are less disturbing. I‚Äôve noticed that the more persistent and dedicated I am to my sadhana, the better I manage the stream of thoughts. How has reading contributed to your development as a spiritual seeker?Whenever I lack motivation and inspiration, I turn to books. For a seeker like me, reading offers diverse perspectives and reminds me of the importance of being aware, conscious, and balanced.In moments when my emotions are out of control and when negativity threatens to consume me, I turn to transformative books like ‚ÄòInner Engineering‚Äô and ‚ÄòMystic Musings‚Äô by Sadhguru. These books give me wisdom and knowledge, guiding me to clarity and stability.What is one major takeaway from your volunteering experience at the main office of Isha Foundation in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu?It's been nearly a decade since I volunteered at the Isha Foundation. I find it an incredibly unique way of approaching life‚Äîa special and noble path to self-transformation.Witnessing thousands of individuals enter deep states of meditation is profoundly touching. Being part of this journey, where I gradually become free from my compulsions and see others striving for the same, has been a significant takeaway for me.Living in the ashram teaches us to transcend our likes and dislikes. By minimising the focus on our individual preferences, we learn to respond to situations based on their requirements rather than our desires.This approach is crucial because it shifts our focus from ourselves to the demands of the present moment. It's not an easy path to follow, but with conscious practice, we gradually become less bound by our identity and gain the flexibility to adapt to any situation.I haven't fully mastered this yet, but this lesson holds immense significance in my spiritual journey and remains one of the most valuable lessons I learned at the Isha Foundation.Sunaina Rana‚Äôs book recommendationsDeath: An Inside StoryAuthor: Sadhguru Publisher: Penguin AnandaYear: 2020This book eased my fear of death, both my own and that of loved ones, breaking its taboo for me.

But they have yet to win a single match in the competition. In both editions, they finished the group stage winless and at the bottom of the table.However, Nepal could change that bitter history when they face the UAE in the tournament opener.‚ÄúOur first target is to defeat the UAE,‚Äù Nepal skipper Indu Barma said. But the task will be a difficult one.The UAE are making their second appearance at the Asia Cup. But under captain Esha Oza, they have emerged as the strongest side among the associated nations.The UAE qualified for the Asia Cup as the winners of the ACC Premier Cup in February. Nepal initially failed to make the Asia Cup but was later included in the main event as one of the two semi-finalists‚Äîthe other being Thailand‚Äîfollowing the expansion of the tournament to eight teams by the Asian Cricket Council.Two years ago, the UAE and Nepal crossed paths in the ACC T20 Women‚Äôs Championship semi-finals. The UAE progressed to the final ahead of Nepal due to a superior net run rate in the group stage after their match yielded no result due to rain. The UAE went on to defeat Malaysia in the final to make their Asia Cup debut.In the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier as well, the match between Nepal and the UAE was abandoned due to rain. However, the UAE finished the group on top and ahead of Nepal due to net run rate. Both the UAE and Nepal progressed to the knockouts as the top two teams. Nepal fell to Thailand in the semis but UAE won the tournament and progressed to the global qualifier (2024 ICC Women's T20 World Cup Qualifier).The UAE also had a blistering run in the T20 World Cup qualifier but ultimately failed in their mission to make their T20 World Cup debut after they were undone by Sri Lanka in the semi-finals.Nepal may have received a boost in their confidence when they defeated Sri Lanka Development Squad in the final and third T20 practice match to avoid series sweep, but their recent form suggests that UAE will still be heavily favoured.According to Barma, if Nepal defeat the UAE, their next goal will be trying to pull off an upset against the big teams and reach the semi-finals.But things are not as easy as it seems.Nepal next play Pakistan, who were runners-up in both editions Nepal participated, next Sunday and cricket‚Äôs powerhouse India on July 23.In the 2016 edition, when all six participating teams were in a single group, Pakistan had bundled Nepal for 47 runs before winning the match by nine wickets.Nepal were also humiliated by India in their next group match when the Indians wrapped up Nepal for just 21 runs to win by 99 runs. Nepal were chasing 121.India have won seven out of eight editions of the Asia Cup since its inauguration in 2004. Bangladesh won 2018 edition defeating India by three wickets.Rubina Chhetri, who is now Nepal‚Äôs most capped women‚Äôs cricketer with 55 appearances in the national team, and Sita Rana Magar were both in Nepal‚Äôs squad in 2016.But Rana Magar hopes Nepal women‚Äôs team will be a lot better this time as they have also drawn inspiration from the men's team who recently participated in the T20 World Cup.‚ÄúOur plan is not just to participate in the tournament. We have a feeling that our team can play a good game against big teams like our men‚Äôs team,‚Äù said Rana Magar.‚ÄúWe have gained clarity on how to bat for a full 20 overs and how to bowl the ball through mentoring. There are positive changes in the team.‚ÄùFormer captain Chhetri is in fine form. The batting allrounder has scored 741 runs from 46 innings for Nepal and will bring inspiration to Asia Cup from her outstanding Premier Cup when she scored an unbeaten 118 against the Maldives in their record total of 227-4 to become Nepal‚Äôs first player to score a century in women‚Äôs T20Is. Chhetri is also the first Nepali player to score a century in women‚Äôs T20Is.Chhetri, who scored 17 (17), 28 (43) and 37 (26) in three warm-up matches against Sri Lanka, will form the core of Nepal‚Äôs batting unit alongside Barma and Rana Magar.Pacer Kabita Joshi also impressed with the ball in the warm-up, while Sabnam Rai and Kritika Marasini will lead the spin threat for Nepal.

In both editions, they finished the group stage winless and at the bottom of the table.However, Nepal could change that bitter history when they face the UAE in the tournament opener.‚ÄúOur first target is to defeat the UAE,‚Äù Nepal skipper Indu Barma said. But the task will be a difficult one.The UAE are making their second appearance at the Asia Cup. But under captain Esha Oza, they have emerged as the strongest side among the associated nations.The UAE qualified for the Asia Cup as the winners of the ACC Premier Cup in February. Nepal initially failed to make the Asia Cup but was later included in the main event as one of the two semi-finalists‚Äîthe other being Thailand‚Äîfollowing the expansion of the tournament to eight teams by the Asian Cricket Council.Two years ago, the UAE and Nepal crossed paths in the ACC T20 Women‚Äôs Championship semi-finals. The UAE progressed to the final ahead of Nepal due to a superior net run rate in the group stage after their match yielded no result due to rain. The UAE went on to defeat Malaysia in the final to make their Asia Cup debut.In the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier as well, the match between Nepal and the UAE was abandoned due to rain. However, the UAE finished the group on top and ahead of Nepal due to net run rate. Both the UAE and Nepal progressed to the knockouts as the top two teams. Nepal fell to Thailand in the semis but UAE won the tournament and progressed to the global qualifier (2024 ICC Women's T20 World Cup Qualifier).The UAE also had a blistering run in the T20 World Cup qualifier but ultimately failed in their mission to make their T20 World Cup debut after they were undone by Sri Lanka in the semi-finals.Nepal may have received a boost in their confidence when they defeated Sri Lanka Development Squad in the final and third T20 practice match to avoid series sweep, but their recent form suggests that UAE will still be heavily favoured.According to Barma, if Nepal defeat the UAE, their next goal will be trying to pull off an upset against the big teams and reach the semi-finals.But things are not as easy as it seems.Nepal next play Pakistan, who were runners-up in both editions Nepal participated, next Sunday and cricket‚Äôs powerhouse India on July 23.In the 2016 edition, when all six participating teams were in a single group, Pakistan had bundled Nepal for 47 runs before winning the match by nine wickets.Nepal were also humiliated by India in their next group match when the Indians wrapped up Nepal for just 21 runs to win by 99 runs. Nepal were chasing 121.India have won seven out of eight editions of the Asia Cup since its inauguration in 2004. Bangladesh won 2018 edition defeating India by three wickets.Rubina Chhetri, who is now Nepal‚Äôs most capped women‚Äôs cricketer with 55 appearances in the national team, and Sita Rana Magar were both in Nepal‚Äôs squad in 2016.But Rana Magar hopes Nepal women‚Äôs team will be a lot better this time as they have also drawn inspiration from the men's team who recently participated in the T20 World Cup.‚ÄúOur plan is not just to participate in the tournament. We have a feeling that our team can play a good game against big teams like our men‚Äôs team,‚Äù said Rana Magar.‚ÄúWe have gained clarity on how to bat for a full 20 overs and how to bowl the ball through mentoring. There are positive changes in the team.‚ÄùFormer captain Chhetri is in fine form. The batting allrounder has scored 741 runs from 46 innings for Nepal and will bring inspiration to Asia Cup from her outstanding Premier Cup when she scored an unbeaten 118 against the Maldives in their record total of 227-4 to become Nepal‚Äôs first player to score a century in women‚Äôs T20Is. Chhetri is also the first Nepali player to score a century in women‚Äôs T20Is.Chhetri, who scored 17 (17), 28 (43) and 37 (26) in three warm-up matches against Sri Lanka, will form the core of Nepal‚Äôs batting unit alongside Barma and Rana Magar.Pacer Kabita Joshi also impressed with the ball in the warm-up, while Sabnam Rai and Kritika Marasini will lead the spin threat for Nepal.

In comparison, imports from India fell by 3.1 percent.Experts attributed ballooning imports from China to a sharp rise in the entry of electric vehicles (EVs). Likewise, a fall in imports from India has been attributed to the export curbs on food by the southern neighbour. In terms of value, imports from China increased by Rs70.44 billion to Rs272.81 billion in the review period.Import from India, however, dropped by Rs29.53 billion to Rs908.30 billion in the period.Due to the drop in imports from India, Nepal‚Äôs total imports declined 1.8 percent to Rs1.45 trillion in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year, which ended mid-June 2024.An official of the National Statistics Office says for a consumption-driven economy, falling imports are a worrisome sign. This suggests people are spending less on services and consumption while exports are stagnant.Rabindra Duwadi, the spokesperson at the Trade and Export Promotion Center, said imports from the north were driven by a massive influx of EVs, smartphones, and readymade garments.Besides, exports of iron, chemical fertiliser, apples and readymade garments too rose significantly. Traders said that China fulfils 80 percent of Nepal's readymade garment needs. The country imported readymade garments worth Rs33.67 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year.In the same vein, Nepal imported 7,931 EVs worth Rs21.83 billion from China in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, up from 1,269 EVs worth Rs3.75 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Similarly, the country imported 1.23 million units of smartphones worth Rs17.27 billion from China in the review period. During the time, Nepal imported 99,965 tonnes of chemical fertiliser worth Rs8.69 billion from China.In the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, the country imported 65,827 tonnes of apples worth Rs6.98 billion from China, compared to 50,153 tonnes worth Rs4.73 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Duwadi said India‚Äôs share of Nepal‚Äôs total imports is 65.5 percent, while China contributes 18.8 percent. Traders say Nepal‚Äôs trade with India is vast, but it is steadily shifting to China. ‚ÄúOne key reason for import growth from China is EVs,‚Äù said Rajan Sharma, a trade expert. ‚ÄúChinese EVs are comparatively cheaper and perform better compared to Indian ones.‚Äù According to market observers, that‚Äôs why there has been an abrupt switch from India‚Äôs Tata Nexon EV to Chinese BYD.Sharma said readymade garments imported from China are cheaper compared to Indian readymade garments, including branded ones, which makes them popular among Nepali customers. ‚ÄúAt the same time, India-made branded clothing items are expensive.‚ÄùThe Chinese Shein clothing brand has quickly gained popularity in Nepal due to its trendy clothes and reasonable prices.Trade experts say that due to the open border, there has been a massive rise in informal trade from India in recent years. Smuggling has thrived after India imposed a ban on foods.According to a research report titled, ‚ÄòDynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,‚Äô prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, only 40 percent of rice is imported from India through formal channels.India‚Äôs share in Nepal‚Äôs imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the share of informal trade is likely to be higher.The research has pointed out that informal trade has thrived after the imposition of a 9 percent agriculture reform fee and a 2.5 percent advanced income tax, resulting in a total duty of 11.5 percent on rice imports.The paper said that India‚Äôs ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food through the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India.Nepal is dependent on onions imported from India. When the Indian government imposed a ban on onion exports from December 2023 to May 2024, the product was readily available in the vegetable market and grocery stores, which indicated that a massive quantity of onions came through informal trade channels.The government did not take a single step to control the illegal trade or negotiate with the Indian government to ease the repeated bans on export of various agricultural goods. Nepal has thus lost out on huge import revenue as goods are coming to Nepal through illegal channels and are easily available in the market.Paras Kharel, executive director of the South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, said overall imports have not been able to rebound in two fiscal years, reflecting the country‚Äôs economic slowdown. However, the rise in EV imports contributed to the sudden rise in imports from China.‚ÄúImports from Tatopani and Rasuwa customs rose by twice as much,‚Äù Kharel said. This shows that imports from China, which were halted after the Covid pandemic, are not gradually improving but are ballooning.According to the Department of Customs, the worth of imports from Tatopani customs increased to Rs37.16 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, compared to Rs11.79 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Similarly, the worth of imports from Rasuwa customs on the northern border increased to Rs55.45 billion in the review period, up from Rs27.25 billion in the same period last fiscal year.

Neither the existing Act nor the amendment bill includes war crimes, crimes against humanity and the issues of child combatants. In its report ‚ÄúThe National Human Rights Commission and Transitional Justice‚Äù, the commission has said that together with murder, enforced disappearance, abduction or disappearances after the kidnapping, torture, rape or other sexual violence, war crimes and crimes against humanity should also be classified as non-amnestiable crimes.The 150-page report the commission is set to unveil on Monday includes its position on the long-pending transitional justice process while also documenting the efforts it made to deliver justice to the war-era victims of human rights violations. Since its establishment in 2002, the commission has investigated 1,073 cases related to the 1996-2006 insurgency and recommended actions against 222 including former Home Secretary and chief of Nepal Police.Following successive governments‚Äô reluctance to follow its recommendations, the commission made public the list of perpetrators in October 2020 and January 2024.The leaders in negotiation are still struggling to finalise whether to list murder as a serious violation of human rights. Despite long negotiations, they have yet to sort out issues of minor Maoist soldiers and sentence reduction. They are also divided on whether victims who refuse to reconcile should be allowed to take their cases to court.The commission‚Äôs report says killing any unarmed individual, regardless of their involvement in the conflict, or those not directly involved in the fight, is a serious violation of human rights. There cannot be amnesty for serious violations of human rights, including war crimes and crimes against humanity. Amnesty for other human rights violations is possible only with the written consent of the victims, according to the commission.‚ÄúThose who refuse pardon should be allowed to seek legal remedy as per the existing laws,‚Äù reads the report. ‚ÄúThe truth and Reconciliation Commission must delve into the cases of the victims who lost their lives or got injured in landmines planted during the insurgency even after the peace process began.‚Äù Issues of child Maoist combatants must be addressed through the law to ensure they get justice, according to the commission.The use of minors in armed conflict is a war crime as per international law. The ruling Maoist Centre, therefore, does not want to include this issue in the law.During the verification process for army integration conducted by UNMIN in 2007, thousands of Maoist fighters had been disqualified for being minors. Among the 4,008 combatants who did not qualify for integration, 2,973 were verified as minors, while the remaining 1,035 had joined the Maoist ‚ÄòPeople‚Äôs Liberation Army‚Äô after the first ceasefire of May 26, 2006‚Äîsix months before the signing of the peace deal. The government had provided between Rs500,000 and Rs800,000 each to the combatants who chose voluntary retirement. However, those who were disqualified didn‚Äôt get any substantial support, except for a few thousand rupees from the United Nations.A group of former child soldiers led by Lenin Bista have filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court demanding the prosecution of the then Maoist supreme commander Pushpa Kamal Dahal, now the country‚Äôs prime minister, and the then ‚Äòpeople‚Äôs government‚Äô chief Baburam Bhattarai, who also is a former prime minister. The final hearing for the petition has been slated for September.Unlike in other issues, the commission has stood with the political parties on reduced sentencing. ‚ÄúThe jail term of convicts who meet the criteria [perpetrators cooperating in the investigation process], can be reduced to a minimum of 25 percent as per existing laws,‚Äù reads the report. ‚ÄúThe criteria for reduced sentencing can be defined in the law.‚Äù Surya Dhungel, a commissioner, said their position is based on international practice where reduced sentencing is common in transitional justice process.The commission has also reiterated that it will send its representative to the panel formed to recommend office bearers in the two transitional justice mechanisms only if there is a commitment from the parties concerned to amend the Act. ‚ÄúWe are firm in our decision. Commitment from top political leadership is a must for the commission to send its representative to the recommendation committee,‚Äù said Dhungel.

Amnesty for other human rights violations is possible only with the written consent of the victims, according to the commission.‚ÄúThose who refuse pardon should be allowed to seek legal remedy as per the existing laws,‚Äù reads the report. ‚ÄúThe truth and Reconciliation Commission must delve into the cases of the victims who lost their lives or got injured in landmines planted during the insurgency even after the peace process began.‚Äù Issues of child Maoist combatants must be addressed through the law to ensure they get justice, according to the commission.The use of minors in armed conflict is a war crime as per international law. The ruling Maoist Centre, therefore, does not want to include this issue in the law.During the verification process for army integration conducted by UNMIN in 2007, thousands of Maoist fighters had been disqualified for being minors. Among the 4,008 combatants who did not qualify for integration, 2,973 were verified as minors, while the remaining 1,035 had joined the Maoist ‚ÄòPeople‚Äôs Liberation Army‚Äô after the first ceasefire of May 26, 2006‚Äîsix months before the signing of the peace deal. The government had provided between Rs500,000 and Rs800,000 each to the combatants who chose voluntary retirement. However, those who were disqualified didn‚Äôt get any substantial support, except for a few thousand rupees from the United Nations.A group of former child soldiers led by Lenin Bista have filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court demanding the prosecution of the then Maoist supreme commander Pushpa Kamal Dahal, now the country‚Äôs prime minister, and the then ‚Äòpeople‚Äôs government‚Äô chief Baburam Bhattarai, who also is a former prime minister. The final hearing for the petition has been slated for September.Unlike in other issues, the commission has stood with the political parties on reduced sentencing. ‚ÄúThe jail term of convicts who meet the criteria [perpetrators cooperating in the investigation process], can be reduced to a minimum of 25 percent as per existing laws,‚Äù reads the report. ‚ÄúThe criteria for reduced sentencing can be defined in the law.‚Äù Surya Dhungel, a commissioner, said their position is based on international practice where reduced sentencing is common in transitional justice process.The commission has also reiterated that it will send its representative to the panel formed to recommend office bearers in the two transitional justice mechanisms only if there is a commitment from the parties concerned to amend the Act. ‚ÄúWe are firm in our decision. Commitment from top political leadership is a must for the commission to send its representative to the recommendation committee,‚Äù said Dhungel.

Lama and Singh had earlier revolted from the Communist Party of Nepal to establish their own faction after the party‚Äôs fourth convention in 1974. Among Singh‚Äôs trusted leaders were Mohan Baidya, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, CP Gajurel and Dev Gurung. But Singh was forced to spend most of the following years politically exiled in India. As a result, Baidya effectively captured the party, renaming it the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN), ‚ÄúMashal,‚Äù pronounced slightly different from Lama‚Äôs CPN ‚ÄúMasal.‚Äù However, Baidya and many senior party leaders faced self-imposed demotion after the party suffered a strategic setback in the now infamous ‚ÄòSector Scandal‚Äô. Baidya was forced to nominate Dahal as the party leader in 1989, a position Dahal has held for three and a half decades.During the first two decades of his leadership, Dahal reigned supreme, as his party led the country into a decade-long violent political conflict that claimed, by some estimates, over 16,000 lives. Despite substantial economic and political costs, the conflict accelerated Nepal‚Äôs transition from a semi-feudal society with an exclusive political system into a more inclusive and secular republic. To that end, the Dahal-led Maoist party received due recognition through a popular mandate of the 2008 first Constituent Assembly elections. But Dahal‚Äôs unnecessary distrust of Nepal‚Äôs more established political parties, which had played a considerable role in bringing his party back into the political mainstream, made him commit blunders and unseated him from a comfortable majority government. His suspicion against fellow comrades who questioned his leadership style and decisions led to multiple splintering of the Maoist party. An insecure leaderDespite leading the country in and out of a transformative political conflict and becoming one of the key signatories of the new constitution, Dahal has remained an insecure leader who takes every opportunity to remind the Nepali people and the world about his ‚Äúrevolutionary contributions‚Äù. Possibly, this deep-seated insecurity emerges from the fact that he is neither seen as an intellectually gifted politician like his fellow comrade Baburam Bhattarai, who is known as an ideologue of the Maoist conflict or as a leader with integrity and simplicity like that of his political gurus Singh and Baidya. The thought of losing the political legacy of the ‚ÄòPeople‚Äôs War‚Äô despite clinging onto the leadership of the party must constantly haunt the Maoist supremo.Dahal‚Äôs insecurity and political hypocrisy were also palpable in the way he derided the Madhesh Movement, which also raised the agendas of federalism and inclusion. Instead of considering them allies, Dahal ordered his party cadres to attack the Madheshi party leaders and their cadres. A large part of the political onus of escalating the tensions leading to the unfortunate Gaur massacre in 2007 will always rest on Dahal. Over the past decade and a half, Dahal has repeatedly failed to display the leadership he is ironically fond of discussing. Despite mobilising thousands of Tharu youths during the conflict, he failed to support their genuine claims on provincial boundaries during the federal structuring. And despite claims of his ‚Äòone-sided love‚Äô for Madhesh, he remained silent as more than 50 Madhesi protesters were indiscriminately killed by the security forces in 2015. Unreliable coalition partnerThere was a time when Dahal led a party that had shaken the country‚Äôs political core. Less than two decades later, he now leads a party that has mostly eroded its political base and only relies on a stronger coalition partner to remain relevant. But has Dahal even proved to be a reliable coalition partner? Let‚Äôs take a closer look. After Baidya split the party in 2012, the CPN-Maoist was reduced to the third position in the second Constituent Assembly elections, a significant loss from its commanding majority in the first CA. In the following two years, Dahal‚Äôs party was not only kept out of power but also forced to endorse a constitution that the Nepali Congress and rival communist party CPN-UML tabled. Having lost the capacity to dictate the political course, Dahal resorted to coalition politics. When the opportunity came, he supported UML‚Äôs Khadga Prasad Oli to cobble up a coalition government in October 2015. However, when the Nepali Congress offered him to lead a new coalition, he abandoned Oli and became Prime Minister in 2016. With the 2017 elections on the horizon, Dahal knew his party would not be able to compete with the larger parties that had successfully led the constitution drafting. With some active external mediation, Dahal persuaded Oli for an electoral alliance and even agreed to an eventual unification of the communist forces. When the left unity won a landslide victory, Dahal was convinced that Oli would honour the agreement to hand over power to him mid-way through the four-year period. When Oli refused, he split the united CPN in 2020, convincing several disgruntled leaders like Madhav Nepal to abandon the party and join a coalition with the Nepali Congress. The new coalition also offered Dahal and his party a comfortable division of electoral seats in the 2022 local, provincial and federal elections. But soon after the elections were over, Dahal bargained for power with both Deuba and Oli. Despite having won only 32 seats in the federal parliament with only 11 percent popular vote, Dahal managed to become Nepal‚Äôs 33rd Prime Minister in December 2022.Impending downfallIn 2014, political analyst CK Lal had told me that Dahal‚Äôs political opportunism would make him relevant in Nepali politics for at least another decade. The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML took exactly a decade to realise that Dahal had been cashing in on Nepal‚Äôs fractured politics. This week, the two parties agreed that Nepal‚Äôs long-term political stability requires an introspection into the present electoral system, which allows electorally less popular outfits to dictate the course of national politics. So, not only have the two large parties decided to pull the plug on the Dahal government, but they also agreed to form an independent commission to study and propose amendments to the current electoral provision.While there is little disagreement that the current electoral system paved the way for more representation of the hitherto marginalised sections, the opportunity to correct inefficacies like expensive election campaigning and manipulation of the proportional candidacy lists by the parties must not be dismissed either. There are also serious doubts about the intention of the two parties to strike a deal at a time when the Nepal Police and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority are investigating some high-profile corruption cases. It is up to the two parties to vindicate their intent by ensuring that the new political course does not interfere in these investigations. And even if the two parties agree to amend the constitutional provisions regarding elections, they will need to gather a national consensus or at least a two-thirds majority. Whatever happens in the next few weeks and months, it is evidently clear Pushpa Kamal Dahal‚Äôs eventual political downfall is on the horizon.

Nepal is set to elect the new prime minister next week. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is almost certain to fail the trust vote. This will be his fifth trust vote in a year and a half. The CPN-UML withdrew its support to the government on July 3 after it ditched its coalition with the CPN (Maoist Centre) and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new government.This is the fourth time in Nepal‚Äôs political history that two major parties are forming a government without a powerful opposition, which observers say weakens democracy's effective functioning.On Tuesday, the IMF completed the fourth review under its four‚Äëyear extended credit facility, allowing Nepal to withdraw $41.3 million to help the country's economic recovery.This brings total disbursements under the extended credit facility for budget support to $247.7 million.The IMF executive board approved the extended credit facility arrangement for Nepal on January 12, 2022. The approved amount totals $371.6 million, which is 180 percent of Nepal‚Äôs special drawing rights quota (SDR) of 282.42 million.‚ÄúNepal‚Äôs economy continues to face challenges,‚Äù said the statement issued by the IMF on Thursday. It said that Nepal‚Äôs growth projected at 3 percent in the fiscal year 2023-24 remains below potential due to subdued domestic demand and post‚Äëpandemic balance sheet repairs. The IMF has talked about Nepal‚Äôs cooperatives sector for the first time.In the statement, the IMF warned about the intensification of financial sector vulnerabilities, such as a further rise in non-performing loans. In this context, ‚Äúmore failures of cooperative lenders could endanger the banking system's soundness,‚Äù the IMF said.According to experts and bankers interviewed by the Post, cooperatives, which the government once embraced as one of the three pillars of the economy, are now threatening the economy.In Nepal, millions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are heavily involved in cooperatives, and their failure could not only damage the fragile economy, but also harm social harmony, say experts. Cooperatives are involved in sectors ranging from dairy and livestock to tailoring and retail.Recently, thousands of victims of cooperatives fraud have staged protests in various parts of the country, demanding the return of deposits embezzled by cooperative operators. Hundreds of such depositors came to Kathmandu and staged protests. The government recently signed an agreement with them, promising to solve their problems as soon as possible.‚ÄúThe problem in the cooperative sector will shake up the banking sector. But if there is a wise move, the banking sector can absorb the shock,‚Äù said Upendra Poudyal, president of the Confederation of Banks and Financial Institutions Nepal. He said that the regulation of cooperatives has already been delayed. ‚ÄúWe have seen that cooperatives are being operated for personal gains. A limited number of people took the benefit.‚Äù ‚ÄúNow, the central bank should begin with a single threshold. Limit the number and start supervision.‚Äù As of mid-March, there are 31,450 cooperatives in Nepal, with 7.38 million members.

They currently employ 94,000 people.In a recent interview, Kashi Raj Dahal, immediate past chairman of the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee, a government agency, told the Post that globally, most cooperatives work in productive sectors like food production, dairy, fruits and other agricultural activities. ‚ÄúBut in Nepal, around 25,000 cooperatives are involved only in financial activities, mainly collecting deposits and issuing loans. Such cooperatives are now in crisis. Over 15,000 are registered to collect deposits. Even others registered as multi-purpose cooperatives primarily engage in savings and credits.

On the pessimistic side, the IMF said that economic activity is expected to increase, reaching 4.9 percent in 2024-25, supported by more robust domestic demand. The statement reads that the cautiously accommodative monetary policy stance, the planned increase in capital expenditures in the 2024-25 budget, additional hydropower generation, and a continued rise in tourist arrivals are expected to boost domestic demand and growth.

Meanwhile, Mahindra Raya Yadav of Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party attended the meeting as the new entrant of the Front.The JSP-Nepal chief boycotted the meeting as he held a serious grudge against Dahal. Former prime minister Dahal is not only accused of masterminding the split of JSP-Nepal but is also blamed for weakening the Socialist Front while in power.Soon after the party split, JSP-Nepal chair Upendra Yadav questioned the Front's relevance. Janata Samajbadi Party, formed by a splinter faction of JSP-Nepal, however, has not joined the Front. The new outfit, which is led by Ashok Rai, has seven lawmakers in the federal parliament while the mother party led by Yadav has five.CPN (Unified Socialist) leader and National Assembly lawmaker Beduram Bhusal, however, claims there is no ground to accuse Dahal. ‚ÄúIt is true that despite being a member of the Front, member parties have taken arbitrary decisions favourable to their party,‚Äù Bhusal told the Post. ‚ÄúBut this does not mean that Dahal had tried to foil the Front.‚ÄùAgni Sapkota, the Maoist Centre leader who attended the Front‚Äôs meeting on Tuesday, told the Post that the members, who had met after a hiatus, took stock of the changed political scenario.‚ÄúAt the meeting, we concluded that the Congress-UML alliance can undermine the achievements in the name of constitution amendment, though their agreement is yet to be made public,‚Äù Sapkota told the Post. ‚ÄúWe have decided to critically analyse every move of the newly formed government.‚ÄùTuesday's meeting of the Front also constituted a four-member task force to review the Front‚Äôs journey and suggest a way forward. The task force consists of Khadga Bishwakarma from Chand‚Äô party, Ganga Narayan Shrestha from Nepal Samajbadi Party, Pramesh Hamal from Unified Socialist and Dev Gurung from Maoist Centre. They have been given a 15-day timeframe to submit their report.Meanwhile, detractors question the Front‚Äôs relevance. Manish Kumar Suman, a JSP-Nepal leader, said that the relevance of the Socialist Front ended after Dahal publicly accepted playing a role to split the JSP-Nepal. ‚ÄúDahal is trying to activate the Front out of desperation after being ousted from power,‚Äù Suman said.Soon after the JSP-Nepal split on May 5, Dahal, while speaking at a function of his party, had said he would do anything to remain in power, indicating his role in the party split. The JSP-Nepal was split on the pretext that some lawmakers from JSP-Nepal and Unified Socialist were approaching the then main opposition Nepali Congress to form a government while both the fringe parties were in the Dahal government.But Bhusal said that the JSP-Nepal leaders might have provided such harsh assessment of the Front as they were in pain of party division, which is natural.Socialist Front was formed with a spirit to strengthen collaboration between the left-leaning political parties. But Dahal used it for his political gain, Suman accused. ‚ÄúOnly after being ousted from the government did Dahal try to activate the Socialist Front,‚Äù he said.Dahal was ousted from the government after he failed to win the parliament‚Äôs trust after his coalition‚Äôs largest partner, the CPN-UML, reached a deal with Nepali Congress on July 1 to form the new government.The Front was formed after years of discussion among some left-leaning political parties. However, Baburam Bhattarai, a longtime advocate of the socialist front, was later left out. Instead of Bhattarai, the Netra Bikram Chand ‚ÄòBiplav'-led Communist Party of Nepal was inducted into the bloc.When formed last year, the Socialist Front had 54 members in Parliament. The Maoist Centre was the largest among them, with 32 seats, followed by JSP-Nepal, with 12 seats at the time, and Unified Socialist‚Äôs 10 seats. But now the Front only has 43 members, including Mahindra Raya Yadav, the chair of Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party. Bhusal, the Unified Socialist vice-chair, argued that the number of lawmakers does not affect the Front‚Äôs functioning. ‚ÄúThe Front was established to strengthen collaboration between the like-minded left-leaning parties so it has nothing to do with the Parliamentary affairs,‚Äù Bhusal said.The primary concept paper of the alliance says that the Socialist Front was established with ‚Äúa basic commitment to federalism, democracy, republicanism, inclusion, and secularism‚Äîthe five basic key features of the Constitution of Nepal.‚Äù Though the Front vowed to release the detailed concept later, it has yet to do so.The primary concept paper released during the inauguration on July 8 last year also states ‚Äòamending the constitution‚Äô as one of its objectives. However, the Maoist Centre, the leading force of the Socialist Front, is criticising the Congress-UML coalition government for including the constitutional amendment as one of its objectives.But Maoist Centre leaders claimed the constitution amendment mentioned in their concept paper is different from what the Congress-UML alliance is trying to do.‚ÄúIt is true that the primary concept paper released by Front last year also mentions the constitution amendment, but it is with the forward looking approach, but the objective of the Congress-UML alliance is different,‚Äù Sapkota argued. ‚ÄúWe suspect they want to abolish the Proportional Representation system from the electoral system apart from other achievements, which would be a regressive move. We won‚Äôt let it happen.‚ÄùKrishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, echoed Sapkota. ‚ÄúThe Socialist Front was advocating for enriching the constitution and making it more progressive by amending it, but the objective of the Congress-UML alliance is different,‚Äù Pokharel said.Dahal harped on the idea of forming the Socialist Front after the dissolution of the Nepal Communist Party, considered to be the most powerful communist force in Nepal‚Äôs history, in early 2021.During a meeting held on March 22, the Front's member parties decided to try to get the CPN-UML, the largest communist party, on board the Socialist Front. They floated the idea as Dahal at the time ditched the Congress and brought the UML on board the ruling coalition.Now with the UML ditching the Maoist Centre and forming the government with Congress, the chances of their participation in the Front has ended for now.

","summary":"CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli was sworn in as the prime minister of Nepal for the fourth time amid a function at the President‚Äôs Office in Sheetal Niwas on Monday. President Ramchandra Paudel administered the oath of office and secrecy to Prime Minister Oli. President Paudel on Sunday had appointed Oli as the prime minister under Article 76 (2) of the constitution as there were no other claimants for the post. After CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the immediate past prime minister, was unable to secure the trust of the House of Representatives during a floor test on Friday, President Paudel had invited political parties to form a new government under Article 76 (2) of the constitution on the same evening, setting a Sunday deadline for submitting claims at the President‚Äôs Office.With no other contender, Oli had in his support submitted the signatures of 166 lawmakers (Nepali Congress‚Äô 88 and UML‚Äôs 78). The minimum number needed to form a government is 138 in the 275-strong House of Representatives.Soon after the swearing-in ceremony on Monday, Prime Minister Oli formed a full 22-member Cabinet, including two deputy prime ministers. Among the 22 members including the prime minister, 10 are from the Congress, while nine represent the UML.

Officials said the move aims to ensure smooth transfer of waste as roads to the landfill often become impassable during the monsoon, preventing the passage of garbage trucks.‚ÄúWe have deployed three excavators, two bulldozers and two loaders to clear landslide debris along the road to the Bancharedanda landfill,‚Äù said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. ‚ÄúAlso, we have kept five more vehicles on standby for immediate deployment if needed.‚ÄùEvery year, during monsoon season, the road to landfill sites gets obstructed in multiple places, obstructing the transfer of house waste collected in the three districts of the capital city‚ÄîKathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Apart from these, some local levels of Kavrepalanchok also discard garbage at the landfill site at Bancharedanda.The metropolis officials said that they had purchased 10 high-pressure pumps to drain floodwaters from inundated settlements.‚ÄúFive pumps have already been sent to the high-risk areas along riversides,‚Äù said Shrestha. ‚ÄúThese can quickly pump away floodwaters.‚ÄùThe city office started repairing the Sisdole road leading to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district just a few weeks before the start of the monsoon. Officials said Rs30 million had been allocated for repairs, which included fixing potholes, concreting roads, and other works.Around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised, according to officials.Besides monsoon-induced road obstructions, garbage disposal is sometimes disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions cause weeks-long halt to door-to-door garbage collection, leading people in the Valley to discard their trash on streets.Officials said that a high-pressure pump is being used to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground.Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river.

Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households.

After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn‚Äôt work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC‚Äôs part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone.

Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.‚ÄúEvery Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,‚Äù said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. ‚ÄúDecisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.‚ÄùDengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.‚ÄúVolunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,‚Äù said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.

The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.‚ÄúVolunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,‚Äù said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.

The international financial institution released the full text of the IMF staff country report on Tuesday. It warned that problems in the savings and cooperatives sector are expanding.The main cause of the failure is investment in illiquid and underperforming assets of cooperatives, which impact repayment capacity, combined with some cases of fraud.The IMF said in the statement that a combination of large data gaps, weak governance, unsound credit and liquidity risk management, and a lack of licensing, effective regulation, monitoring, and supervision resulted in the failure and closure of multiple cooperatives.On May 28, the lower house formed a seven-member parliamentary committee to investigate cooperatives fraud.Immediate past home minister Rabi Lamichhane, who is also president of Rastriya Swatantra Party, has been accused of embezzling millions of rupees from multiple cooperatives while he headed the Gorkha Media Network before entering politics.The IMF said that authorities need a comprehensive strategy to deal with the issues in cooperatives.It said that over 14,000 cooperatives hold an estimated Rs478 billion of savings deposits, one-twelfth the size of banking sector deposits as of June 2023.‚ÄúThere is an increasing risk of negative spillovers to other cooperatives and the smallest regulated banks,‚Äù the IMF said. On Tuesday, a delegation of the Central Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation Department of the ruling CPN-UML submitted a 12-point suggestion to the newly appointed minister for Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, Balaram Adhikari. ‚ÄúWe have suggested ensuring that depositors‚Äô money is safe in cooperatives,‚Äù said Khagraj Adhikari, chief of the department and former chief minister of Gandaki Province. ‚ÄúWe have demanded immediate action against the people involved in the irregularities and cooperatives fraud.‚Äù He said the cooperatives, which can be established as a strong economic pillar, need major reforms. The delegation has recommended forming a high-level, powerful task force to address the issues in the sector. The erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government, on May 28, while unveiling the budget for 2024-25, had promised to return at least Rs500,000 to each depositor by recovering it from the directors‚Äô assets. Yet doubts persist over whether depositors will get their money back.Some economists have warned about potential mass protests if the cooperatives issue is not resolved soon.The IMF has recommended a strategy of central coordination of the 761 district and provincial cooperatives regulators to facilitate the cleanup of the problematic cooperatives. It said that reforms in the supervisory and regulatory architecture are needed. ‚ÄúGiven likely limited resources, this strategy needs to ensure that the largest financially sound cooperatives remain stable and are appropriately regulated while dealing with problematic cooperatives.‚ÄùNepal has a large and vibrant cooperative sector regulated by many agencies. There are around 32,000 registered cooperatives. In addition to cooperatives, which focus on providing savings and loan services, cooperatives are active in areas such as agriculture, forestry and several other activities. These non-financial cooperatives can allocate up to 30 percent of their activities to savings and loan services. According to the IMF, there are more than 14,000 cooperatives and around 10,000 non-financial cooperatives that also provide financial services. As of June 2023, cooperatives held Rs478 billion in savings deposits and Rs426 billion in assets. Cooperatives are regulated based on their geographical scope‚Äîat the federal, provincial, or local level. As a result, there are a maximum of 761 different regulators. If a cooperative is declared problematic, the relevant regulator must appoint a Problematic Cooperatives Asset Management Committee. Since mid-2023, pressures in the Nepali cooperatives have been mounting. Gauri Bahadur Karki, former chair of the Special Court and the head of an inquiry commission formed in 2013 to investigate troubled saving and credit cooperatives, told the Post last year that cooperatives were in trouble after the government halted plotting of land in 2022. ‚ÄúMost cooperatives‚Äô operation model involves investing in land and paying interest after generating profits from selling such land. With the government abruptly halting plotting, many cooperatives failed to sell the land, which resulted in their failure to pay promised interest, and the depositors who could not recover their money had to stage protests.‚ÄùAccording to Karki, other problems included investing in land and misappropriation of funds by the cooperatives‚Äô promoters.The IMF said that the Department of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, and subnational authorities are reportedly declaring an increasing number of cooperatives problematic, implying the need for decisive intervention to prevent further contagion. The IMF has recommended three kinds of steps to deal with the issue: immediate steps, near-term steps (within one year), and medium-term steps (1-2 years).In the immediate steps, the IMF has recommended halting the registration of new cooperatives. The current registration does not provide the same scrutiny as licensing, and adequate supervision is not currently guaranteed. It said a temporary stop on registering new cooperatives at federal, provincial, and local levels until the issues have been addressed and the licensing and supervisory process and capacity have been improved would be appropriate. ‚ÄúResolution options in the strategy should follow the existing legal framework and could focus on liquidation combined with repayment of savings of failed cooperatives, possibly the transfer of assets and liabilities of failed cooperatives to healthy cooperatives or their continuation after restructuring.‚Äù Near-term steps involve tightening and enforcing existing regulatory requirements. The recent crisis reveals flaws in applying the legislative and regulatory framework. The bar for cooperatives must be raised while customising the requirements to the size and nature of the businesses and a realistic supervision capacity. Authorities could tighten existing regulatory requirements in capitalisation, liquidity, loan concentration, and governance. Cooperatives should be required to report regularly. They could be given a certain period to meet the requirements, and compliance with these needs to be closely monitored. The medium-term step involves starting to license cooperatives. As a proper authorisation and licensing process hasn‚Äôt been established under the current regime, licensing is needed for both existing cooperatives and new entities.The licensing regime should include a mechanism for the regulator to verify compliance and a process for treating cases of significant non-compliance (which could result in the withdrawal or suspension of the licence). The IMF has recommended ensuring that the Cooperatives Act includes creating a debt information centre, credit tribunal, and savings and guarantee fund for cooperatives. These institutions could be aligned with existing structures, the global organisation said. For example, the debt information centre could be set up within the Credit Information Bureau, allowing all financial institutions access to information on debtors. The savings and guarantee fund could be modelled on the Nepali Deposit Insurance System, which the country started in 2010. Under this scheme, deposit guarantee coverage is up to Rs500,000 per individual per member institution, applicable to savings and fixed deposits. ","summary":"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has inserted a separate annex on savings and credit cooperatives in its staff country report, flagging a risk to Nepal‚Äôs economy that could trigger social unrest if the ongoing problems are not sorted out.It said that several cooperatives have collapsed in the past six months, causing a loss or freezing of client savings and creating small-scale social unrest. The international financial institution released the full text of the IMF staff country report on Tuesday. It warned that problems in the savings and cooperatives sector are expanding.The main cause of the failure is investment in illiquid and underperforming assets of cooperatives, which impact repayment capacity, combined with some cases of fraud.The IMF said in the statement that a combination of large data gaps, weak governance, unsound credit and liquidity risk management, and a lack of licensing, effective regulation, monitoring, and supervision resulted in the failure and closure of multiple cooperatives.On May 28, the lower house formed a seven-member parliamentary committee to investigate cooperatives fraud.Immediate past home minister Rabi Lamichhane, who is also president of Rastriya Swatantra Party, has been accused of embezzling millions of rupees from multiple cooperatives while he headed the Gorkha Media Network before entering politics.The IMF said that authorities need a comprehensive strategy to deal with the issues in cooperatives.It said that over 14,000 cooperatives hold an estimated Rs478 billion of savings deposits, one-twelfth the size of banking sector deposits as of June 2023.‚ÄúThere is an increasing risk of negative spillovers to other cooperatives and the smallest regulated banks,‚Äù the IMF said. On Tuesday, a delegation of the Central Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation Department of the ruling CPN-UML submitted a 12-point suggestion to the newly appointed minister for Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, Balaram Adhikari. ‚ÄúWe have suggested ensuring that depositors‚Äô money is safe in cooperatives,‚Äù said Khagraj Adhikari, chief of the department and former chief minister of Gandaki Province. ‚ÄúWe have demanded immediate action against the people involved in the irregularities and cooperatives fraud.‚Äù He said the cooperatives, which can be established as a strong economic pillar, need major reforms. The delegation has recommended forming a high-level, powerful task force to address the issues in the sector. The erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government, on May 28, while unveiling the budget for 2024-25, had promised to return at least Rs500,000 to each depositor by recovering it from the directors‚Äô assets. Yet doubts persist over whether depositors will get their money back.Some economists have warned about potential mass protests if the cooperatives issue is not resolved soon.The IMF has recommended a strategy of central coordination of the 761 district and provincial cooperatives regulators to facilitate the cleanup of the problematic cooperatives. It said that reforms in the supervisory and regulatory architecture are needed. ‚ÄúGiven likely limited resources, this strategy needs to ensure that the largest financially sound cooperatives remain stable and are appropriately regulated while dealing with problematic cooperatives.‚ÄùNepal has a large and vibrant cooperative sector regulated by many agencies. There are around 32,000 registered cooperatives. In addition to cooperatives, which focus on providing savings and loan services, cooperatives are active in areas such as agriculture, forestry and several other activities. These non-financial cooperatives can allocate up to 30 percent of their activities to savings and loan services. According to the IMF, there are more than 14,000 cooperatives and around 10,000 non-financial cooperatives that also provide financial services. As of June 2023, cooperatives held Rs478 billion in savings deposits and Rs426 billion in assets. Cooperatives are regulated based on their geographical scope‚Äîat the federal, provincial, or local level. As a result, there are a maximum of 761 different regulators. If a cooperative is declared problematic, the relevant regulator must appoint a Problematic Cooperatives Asset Management Committee. Since mid-2023, pressures in the Nepali cooperatives have been mounting.

Iron and other nutritional deficiencies, malaria, hookworm infection, chronic infections, and genetic conditions, including sickle cell diseases, are among the causes for anaemia. Studies show that 39 percent of girls aged 10 and 19 years and 21 percent of boys of the same age group suffer from anaemia in Nepal. Health authorities however, have been preparing the supplement administration programme only for girls.Health officials said that they have also been considering providing the supplement tablets to boys as well, as several countries have already started administering iron-folic acid to boys.Doctors say anaemia in adults can cause fatigue, lethargy, reduced physical productivity, and poor work performance. It is a major concern among pregnant women, as problems can lead to increased maternal mortality rates and poor birth outcomes.The Health Ministry has been providing the supplement at government schools across the country since 2016. Some local levels had already been administering the supplement tablets in private schools.Thapa said that all schools, whether government or private, will implement the supplementation programme from the new fiscal year. Under the programme, eligible girls will be administered a supplement tablet every week for three months. They will be administered the tablet again after three months and continued for 13 weeks. Thapa said that 26 supplement tablets will be administered per person in a year.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 conducted by the ministry shows that 43 percent of the children aged between six to 59 months have been found to be anaemic‚Äî25 percent mildly anaemic, 18 percent moderately anaemic and one percent severely anaemic.The prevalence of anaemia in children aged between six to 59 months has decreased from 53 percent in 2016 to 43 percent in 2022.

More than half the women (52 percent) are anaemic in the Madhesh Province.In the 1990s, 75 percent of pregnant women in Nepal were found to be suffering from anaemia.Anaemia during pregnancy increases the risk of foetal growth retardation and low birth weight, premature delivery, increased perinatal mortality, and reduced resistance to infection for both mother and baby. Thapa said anaemia is a serious concern for children as it can impair their cognitive development and can have long-term health and economic implications for society.

Maternal health experts, however, say that even if the country has made good progress in reducing maternal deaths, the current maternal mortality ratio is more than double the Sustainable Development Goals target, which is 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030.Neonatal deaths have not declined between 2016 and 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government‚Äôs target for the Sustainable Development Goals was to reduce neonatal mortality to 16 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2022 and 12 in every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The health ministry has been taking several measures to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths, including installing an underfloor heating system at birthing centres, setting up special newborn care units, training doctors, nurses, and paramedics in the district hospitals and distributing non-pneumatic anti-shock garments to prevent maternal deaths from excessive bleeding.Besides, the ministry provides free service and travel allowances for those opting for institutional delivery and antenatal visits. It also distributes misoprostol, a medication used to treat postpartum bleeding in new mothers, through female community health volunteers.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don‚Äôt know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen‚Äôs bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn‚Äôt have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn‚Äôt release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right‚Äînot too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It‚Äôs crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker‚Äôs repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‚ÄòBliss Brownies‚Äô.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar¬Ω tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right‚Äînot too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It‚Äôs crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker‚Äôs repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‚ÄòBliss Brownies‚Äô.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar¬Ω tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity‚Äîa space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‚Äòoasis‚Äô for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It‚Äôs a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.‚ÄúIn developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,‚Äù says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone‚Äîqueer and non-queer alike‚Äîto share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,‚Äù Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari‚Äôs identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. ‚ÄúAt first, I didn‚Äôt understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,‚Äù Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one‚Äôs identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn‚Äôt afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.‚ÄúDuring my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,‚Äù Adhikari says.‚ÄúThe time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.‚ÄùFour years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the caf√© because of its welcoming atmosphere.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‚ÄòDahi Chiura Khane din,‚Äô‚Äù she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. ‚ÄúI hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd have any other place to turn to,‚Äù she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, ‚ÄúThis is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn‚Äôt exist here. It‚Äôs where even those who aren‚Äôt accepted at home can feel accepted.‚ÄùSahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu‚Äôs first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. ‚ÄúAs an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.‚ÄùThe welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the caf√© and appreciates the importance of such spaces.‚ÄúPreviously, I didn‚Äôt know much about the queer community and didn‚Äôt care much. But now, coming into this caf√©, I‚Äôve been interested in their rights and issues. I‚Äôve realised that we‚Äôre not so different after all. We are all human,‚Äù he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.‚ÄúLike how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,‚Äù he says.

Yet, pockets of the past remain‚Äîsmall, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today‚Äôs Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour‚Äôs walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana‚Äôs historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‚ÄòKhokana Museum‚Äô. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area‚Äôs history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water‚Äîa practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.¬† ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‚ÄòAbout Dry Grasses‚Äô, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening‚Äîto what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‚Äòlife‚Äôs turning point?‚Äô How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.‚ÄúHow much oxygen do you need for the summit?‚Äù sounds more like ‚ÄúHow much do you need to hold on to life?‚Äù How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, ‚ÄúIs this journey worth this much?‚ÄùI had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father‚Äôs memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature‚Äôs masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like ‚ÄúHow will I endure?‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow will I finish?‚Äù started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‚ÄòGods‚Äô that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there‚Äîbefore and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‚ÄòMy Soul Beyond the Mountain‚Äô.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. ","summary":"‚ÄúHow much oxygen do you have for the summit?‚ÄùI think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‚ÄòAbout Dry Grasses‚Äô, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening‚Äîto what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‚Äòlife‚Äôs turning point?‚Äô How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.‚ÄúHow much oxygen do you need for the summit?‚Äù sounds more like ‚ÄúHow much do you need to hold on to life?‚Äù How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, ‚ÄúIs this journey worth this much?‚ÄùI had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father‚Äôs memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature‚Äôs masterpieces at every turn.

Vance, who opposes military aid for Ukraine and warned Europe will have to rely less on the United States to defend the continent, as his candidate for vice president.Trump sparked fierce criticism from Western officials for suggesting he would not protect countries that failed to meet the transatlantic military alliance‚Äôs defence spending targets and would even encourage Russia to attack them.Germany has faced criticism for repeatedly missing a NATO target of spending 2% of its economic output on defence.Depleted military stocksThe stocks of Germany‚Äôs armed forces, already run down by decades of underinvestment, have been further depleted by arms supplies to Kyiv.So far, Berlin has donated three Patriot air defence units to Kyiv, more than any other country, bringing down the number of Patriot systems in Germany to nine.Germany‚Äôs fractious coalition of left-leaning Social Democrats, pro-business liberals and ecologist Greens has struggled to comply with NATO‚Äôs spending target due to self-imposed rules that limit the amount of state borrowing they can take on.Although military aid to Ukraine will be cut, Germany will comply with the NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defence in 2025, with a total of 75.3 billion euros.Days after Russia‚Äôs 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a ‚ÄúZeitenwende‚Äù ‚Äì German for historic turning point - with a 100 billion euro special fund to bring the military up to speed.From this special fund, there will be 22.0 billion euros more for defence, plus 53.3 billion euros in the regular budget, still less than that sought by Defence Minister Boris Pistorius.The budget for 2025 comes with the mid-term financial planning until 2028, the year when the armed forces‚Äô special fund to meet NATO‚Äôs minimum spending goals is due to run out and 80 billion will be needed for defence, as noted in the financial plan.In 2028, there is a gap of 39 billion euros in the regular budget, of which 28 billion euros are needed to comply with the NATO target without the special fund, sources from the finance ministry said.Decisions on how the hole will be plugged are not likely to be taken until after the 2025 election.‚ÄúThe 80 billion euros that have been put on display for 2028 simply do not exist,‚Äù said Ingo Gaedechens, member of the parliament‚Äôs budget committee from the conservative opposition party CDU.‚ÄúThe coalition is not even trying to cover this up but are openly admitting it.‚Äù ","summary":"Germany plans to halve military aid to Ukraine in 2025 amidst concerns over possible funding cuts if Trump returns to the White House."},{"hash":"4d1e5970683b220a3a181fcf8a9659ad24ba8e6238140fc24bf200beeabc779f","title":"unauthorised-translation-and-piracy-of-foreign-books-thrive-in-nepal","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/books/2023/07/31/unauthorised-translation-and-piracy-of-foreign-books-thrive-in-nepal","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2023/news/books-1690776078.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1690761600000,"source":"kp","category":"books","content":"Nepal‚Äôs book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. ‚ÄúAll books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,‚Äù Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.‚ÄùTranslating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal‚Äôs book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who‚Äôs who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven‚Äôt just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. ‚ÄúThese translations are poor,‚Äù Baral says. ‚ÄúTomes with 1200‚Äì1300 pages have been trimmed to 200‚Äì300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.‚ÄùAnother popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.‚ÄúWe have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,‚Äù Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book‚Äôs Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: ‚ÄúAchyut Koirala, who has a master‚Äôs in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films.

Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book‚Äîall unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, ‚ÄúAt this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market.

Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book‚Äôs sequel as ‚ÄòPrem ra Jeevan‚Äô. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima‚Äôs permission. ‚ÄúAbout a decade back, we didn‚Äôt know how to ask for permission,‚Äù he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else‚Äôs work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima‚Äôs anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‚ÄòAaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina‚Äô. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. ‚ÄúI have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,‚Äù Pradhan, who is also a children‚Äôs book writer, says. ‚ÄúI just copy-edited it upon request.‚ÄùBishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. ‚ÄúWe translated the book long ago,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe are still trying to get translation rights.‚ÄùIndigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar‚Äôs Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. ‚ÄúAfter I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,‚Äù Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera‚Äôs You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book‚Äôs unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don‚Äôt even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it‚Äôd be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author‚Äôs permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn‚Äôt demand much for translation rights given Nepal‚Äôs small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. ‚ÄúPublishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,‚Äù he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari‚Äôs bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book‚Äôs translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru‚Äôs Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. ‚ÄúThis phenomenon not just hampers Nepal‚Äôs fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country‚Äôs reputation in the global market,‚Äù Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúNobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.‚Äù Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One‚Äôs pain, another‚Äôs pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, ‚ÄúThis is a pirated copy and I‚Äôm the author of this book.‚Äù The youth wasn‚Äôt bothered and replied, ‚ÄúOkay, you can buy it at a discount.‚ÄùThis anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta‚Äôs friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. ‚ÄúWe sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,‚Äù says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal‚Äôs image internationally. ‚ÄúThere was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‚Äòpiracy king‚Äô,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNow there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.‚ÄùAs tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.‚ÄúAfter the government‚Äôs decision, we stopped importing books for a while,‚Äù says Shrestha of Education Books. ‚ÄúThe import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.‚ÄùPirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn‚Äôt levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. ‚ÄúThe government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country‚Äôs economy as well,‚Äù he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India‚Äôs sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. ‚ÄúTo confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,‚Äù Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, ‚ÄúKeeping ISBN number at one‚Äôs will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.‚ÄùBy the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar‚Äôs office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act‚Äôs clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act‚Äôs subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act‚Äôs clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‚Äòimportation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.‚ÄôIf anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision‚Äôs implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. ‚ÄúCreation is a crucial part of humanity‚Äôs benefit,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIf intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there‚Äôd be no inspiration to create something.‚ÄùBal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.‚ÄúIn the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,‚Äù Mukhiya says. ‚ÄúBut in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.‚Äù(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

The clause restricts the ‚Äòimportation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.‚ÄôIf anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision‚Äôs implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. ‚ÄúCreation is a crucial part of humanity‚Äôs benefit,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIf intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there‚Äôd be no inspiration to create something.‚ÄùBal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.‚ÄúIn the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,‚Äù Mukhiya says. ‚ÄúBut in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.‚Äù(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. ‚ÄúYouths started going to America about six-seven years ago,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.‚Äù Budha‚Äôs own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village.

This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors‚Äô pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process.

Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.‚ÄùFor six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. ‚ÄúWhen I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,‚Äù he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak‚Äôs wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt know what exactly happened,‚Äù said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters.

On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn‚Äôt include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‚Äòbase areas‚Äô of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. ‚ÄúThis is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,‚Äù Shrestha said. ‚ÄúThe Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.‚Äù Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency‚Äôs ‚Äòbase areas‚Äô is due to the political system‚Äôs abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. ‚ÄúThe traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDevelopments after the peace process also failed to address that.

The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn‚Äôt have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can‚Äôt afford hospital stays,‚Äù BK said. ‚ÄúBut even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won‚Äôt willingly offer me the service.‚ÄùThe Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,‚Äù said Aryal. ‚ÄúMoving forward, we will follow the instructions.‚Äù The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. ‚ÄúOur monitoring and inspection is also lax, that‚Äôs why most hospitals ignore the rules,‚Äù he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. ‚ÄúOur manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need more people for that‚Äù. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. ‚ÄúThe hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,‚Äù said Khadka. ‚ÄúLegal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.‚Äù The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive‚Äôs implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department‚Äôs chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. ‚ÄúHospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,‚Äù KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‚Äòmedical city‚Äô  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges‚ÄîChitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences‚Äîthat also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.‚ÄúAlthough the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,‚Äù said Chapagain. ‚ÄúOur department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‚ÄòDiscounts for the needy‚Äô on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.‚ÄùMeanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. ‚ÄúThere are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That‚Äôs why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,‚Äù said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies‚Äô inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City‚Äôs Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. ‚ÄúWe have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,‚Äù he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality‚Äôs health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. ‚ÄúHowever, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,‚Äù Bhattarai said. ‚ÄúWe found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.‚ÄùThe hospital‚Äôs director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. ‚ÄúBut the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.‚ÄùButwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis‚Äô apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government‚Äôs health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan‚Äôs health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.‚ÄúI have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,‚Äù he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan‚Äôs Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital‚Äôs help. ‚ÄúThe hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me.

I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,‚Äù said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. ‚ÄúThey do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.‚Äù¬† ","summary":"Gyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn‚Äôt have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can‚Äôt afford hospital stays,‚Äù BK said. ‚ÄúBut even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won‚Äôt willingly offer me the service.‚ÄùThe Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,‚Äù said Aryal. ‚ÄúMoving forward, we will follow the instructions.‚Äù The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. ‚ÄúOur monitoring and inspection is also lax, that‚Äôs why most hospitals ignore the rules,‚Äù he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. ‚ÄúOur manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need more people for that‚Äù. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. ‚ÄúThe hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,‚Äù said Khadka. ‚ÄúLegal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.‚Äù The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive‚Äôs implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department‚Äôs chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. ‚ÄúHospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,‚Äù KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‚Äòmedical city‚Äô  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges‚ÄîChitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences‚Äîthat also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.‚ÄúAlthough the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,‚Äù said Chapagain. ‚ÄúOur department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‚ÄòDiscounts for the needy‚Äô on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.‚ÄùMeanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. ‚ÄúThere are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That‚Äôs why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,‚Äù said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies‚Äô inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City‚Äôs Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. ‚ÄúWe have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,‚Äù he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality‚Äôs health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. ‚ÄúHowever, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,‚Äù Bhattarai said. ‚ÄúWe found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.‚ÄùThe hospital‚Äôs director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. ‚ÄúBut the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.‚ÄùButwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis‚Äô apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government‚Äôs health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan‚Äôs health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.‚ÄúI have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,‚Äù he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan‚Äôs Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital‚Äôs help. ‚ÄúThe hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.‚ÄùDr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. ‚ÄúPatients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,‚Äù said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. ‚ÄúThey do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.‚Äù¬† "},{"hash":"de54d4f6478a4598a261b71a7540044e8e5ac87fde2125d7b502317c24e54286","title":"perplexities-of-the-permanent-minority","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/07/16/perplexities-of-the-permanent-minority","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2019/default/WhatsAppImage20240717at084852-1721185486.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1721088000000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"In an adaptation of musical chairs repeatedly being played in Nepal since 2015, two performers take turns installing the third contestant on the throne after hush-hush parleys and midnight settlements.

As a wheelchair user and disability advocate, I found the experience life-changing.When I arrived in Bangladesh, I didn‚Äôt see people with visible disabilities on the streets. No wheelchair users or people with visual impairments were in sight, and the overall accessibility was as bad as, if not worse than, what we have in Nepal. In Kathmandu, people with physical disabilities use modified scooters; in Bangladesh, I saw none. So, I was sceptical initially, thinking this might be another development sector‚Äôs attempt to appear inclusive without any substance.Breaking barriersMy doubts started fading with the first play I saw: ‚Äú71 in Silence‚Äù. The play was about the Mukti Juddho, or the Bangladesh Liberation War, featuring wheelchair users and people with hearing and visual disabilities as actors. Their performances resonated with immense talent. Seeing them perform such complex movements and scenes, some even getting out of their wheelchairs and dancing on the floor, was inspiring. It was a big reminder of what can be achieved when barriers are removed and opportunities are given. Throughout the festival, actors with severe disabilities continued to take centre-stage not just as token representation but as lead performers. One of the standouts was the adaptation of William Shakespeare‚Äôs A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream, which was full of music and vibrance. The nearly house-full audience was captivated; the audience‚Äôs reaction to this play was unlike anything I'd seen in Nepal. There was a clear sense of awe and respect, not pity or discomfort. The audience were genuinely moved by the performers' talent and their storytelling. It made me wonder how we could create such an atmosphere of appreciation and understanding back home.One thing that impressed me was the plays‚Äô creative use of sign language. In Nepal, we often have sign language interpreters standing at the side of the stage, making it difficult for deaf audiences to follow the action and the interpretation simultaneously. Here, the sign language was integrated into the performance. Characters would take turns interpreting sign language, making it a part of the play rather than a separate element. This made a big difference in inclusivity and accessibility. Incorporating this into Nepali theatres could be game-changing. But there are challenges. We would need to train the performers in sign language, which will take time and resources. There might also be resistance from those who are used to the traditional way. But the benefit‚Äîa more immersive experience for deaf audiences and a more inclusive show overall‚Äîwill be worth it.From discomfort to confidenceI also met and talked to some performers, including a lead actor who walks using his hands and knees instead of a wheelchair. He is a final-year bachelor‚Äôs student and manages nine cows as part of his family‚Äôs livelihood. Acting has always been his passion, but he never had the chance to pursue it until this festival. Before becoming an actor, he felt uncomfortable about people staring at him while walking to his college. Now, with newfound confidence, he proudly returns those stares. He shared how even actors without disabilities look up to him as a mentor, which has been emotionally uplifting. Seeing so many people with disabilities from all over Bangladesh participating in these plays made me realise the importance of inclusive arts. It‚Äôs not just a leisure activity; it‚Äôs a tool for empowerment and changing societal perspectives. It also made me think of all the artists with disabilities in Nepal we are not tapping into. How many talents are we missing because we haven‚Äôt created the space? His journey from discomfort to confidence proves what happens when we open the arts to people with disabilities.The power of inclusive arts extends beyond Bangladesh. Traditional narratives that portrayed disabled characters as objects of pity or inspiration are being challenged. Instead, we're seeing more nuanced and authentic representations. However, progress is uneven. While some countries are making strides in inclusive policies for cultural spaces, others lag. The debate about disability inclusion in theatres is evolving, but it's clear that we need more than just accessibility ramps and sign language interpreters.Enabling the disabledIn Nepal, we have made some progress in making theatres more accessible to audiences with disabilities, introducing ramps and sign language interpreters. These are necessary but feel like tokenism‚Äîa box to tick rather than real inclusion. What is missing is the development of artists with disabilities themselves. Unlike what I saw in Bangladesh, I rarely see performers with disabilities on stage in Nepali theatre. We must go beyond making theatre accessible for audiences with disabilities and focus on developing artists with disabilities. This means training programmes, opportunities for artists with disabilities to lead creative projects and challenging the idea that disability is a barrier to creativity.I have been working with various people and organisations since 2019 to increase the cultural participation of people with disabilities in Nepal. Last year, I worked with the British Council to produce ‚ÄúBeyond the Norm‚Äù, a toolkit to make programmes and events more accessible to people with disabilities. It‚Äôs an easy-to-use document that all cultural practitioners should use. This year, my organisation is working with ‚ÄúBirds of Paradise‚Äù theatre, UK, on a disability theatre production. These are small steps through which I hope to support disability inclusion in the culture and arts sector as an audience and, more importantly, as creative professionals.One of the most impactful moments for me at the festival was a play in which the actor I met earlier was tangled in a rope and trying to move forward while others were pulling him back. That powerful scene portrayed how society holds people with disabilities back. His question ‚ÄúAll the things you do are normal and beautiful, but what we do is different and abnormal. Why?‚Äù left the audience speechless. ","summary":"I recently attended the International Disability Arts Festival 2024 in Bangladesh, organised by the British Council.

This made a big difference in inclusivity and accessibility. Incorporating this into Nepali theatres could be game-changing. But there are challenges. We would need to train the performers in sign language, which will take time and resources. There might also be resistance from those who are used to the traditional way. But the benefit‚Äîa more immersive experience for deaf audiences and a more inclusive show overall‚Äîwill be worth it.From discomfort to confidenceI also met and talked to some performers, including a lead actor who walks using his hands and knees instead of a wheelchair. He is a final-year bachelor‚Äôs student and manages nine cows as part of his family‚Äôs livelihood. Acting has always been his passion, but he never had the chance to pursue it until this festival. Before becoming an actor, he felt uncomfortable about people staring at him while walking to his college. Now, with newfound confidence, he proudly returns those stares. He shared how even actors without disabilities look up to him as a mentor, which has been emotionally uplifting. Seeing so many people with disabilities from all over Bangladesh participating in these plays made me realise the importance of inclusive arts. It‚Äôs not just a leisure activity; it‚Äôs a tool for empowerment and changing societal perspectives. It also made me think of all the artists with disabilities in Nepal we are not tapping into. How many talents are we missing because we haven‚Äôt created the space? His journey from discomfort to confidence proves what happens when we open the arts to people with disabilities.The power of inclusive arts extends beyond Bangladesh. Traditional narratives that portrayed disabled characters as objects of pity or inspiration are being challenged. Instead, we're seeing more nuanced and authentic representations. However, progress is uneven. While some countries are making strides in inclusive policies for cultural spaces, others lag. The debate about disability inclusion in theatres is evolving, but it's clear that we need more than just accessibility ramps and sign language interpreters.Enabling the disabledIn Nepal, we have made some progress in making theatres more accessible to audiences with disabilities, introducing ramps and sign language interpreters. These are necessary but feel like tokenism‚Äîa box to tick rather than real inclusion. What is missing is the development of artists with disabilities themselves. Unlike what I saw in Bangladesh, I rarely see performers with disabilities on stage in Nepali theatre. We must go beyond making theatre accessible for audiences with disabilities and focus on developing artists with disabilities. This means training programmes, opportunities for artists with disabilities to lead creative projects and challenging the idea that disability is a barrier to creativity.I have been working with various people and organisations since 2019 to increase the cultural participation of people with disabilities in Nepal. Last year, I worked with the British Council to produce ‚ÄúBeyond the Norm‚Äù, a toolkit to make programmes and events more accessible to people with disabilities. It‚Äôs an easy-to-use document that all cultural practitioners should use. This year, my organisation is working with ‚ÄúBirds of Paradise‚Äù theatre, UK, on a disability theatre production. These are small steps through which I hope to support disability inclusion in the culture and arts sector as an audience and, more importantly, as creative professionals.One of the most impactful moments for me at the festival was a play in which the actor I met earlier was tangled in a rope and trying to move forward while others were pulling him back. That powerful scene portrayed how society holds people with disabilities back. His question ‚ÄúAll the things you do are normal and beautiful, but what we do is different and abnormal. Why?‚Äù left the audience speechless.

In a sense, it was an experimentation and training opportunity created for the next generation of sample survey researchers. This, therefore, had obvious caveats on the robustness of its outcomes and usability of inferences.Last month, the National Statistical Office (NSO), the rebaptised CBS, published a report of the fourth edition of the Survey (NLSS-IV) 2023-24. The original objective of the NLSS to ‚Äúassess the poverty situation‚Äù does not seem to have changed. However, in nearly three decades of exercises that published three editions‚Äî1996, 2004 and 2011‚Äîthis government entity seems to have barely learned to conduct such sample-based surveys, improve its inferential credibility, and maintain research integrity while working with a disproportionately small sample of a large population.Unrepresentative samplingNo doubt, sample surveys, as against population surveys, are risky and can provide only indicative inference even if they are implemented with utmost professionalism and high precision research. Otherwise, they suffer from self-selection bias and inferential misrepresentation due to underrepresentation of data variation. Besides, creating a mini sample from an already available population dataset to inquire into the topic that the population sample itself could carry out better is a redundant exercise and a misuse of resources. First, the NLSS rituals on top of the National Census do not add any value to better understanding the country's socioeconomic realities. Second, the authenticity of small-sized sample surveys like the NLLS can be established if, and only if, their statistical outcomes are consistent with those of comprehensive surveys like censuses. The NLSS exercises have failed on both counts.For the NLSS-IV, data was collected from a sample of 9,600 out of 6.761 million households, or 0.14 percent. When it is disaggregated into selected 15 geographical domains, the average number of households surveyed in each domain is only 640. This is certainly a gross underrepresentation to statistically infer anything meaningful. For example, the NLSS-IV claims the proportion of households in Nepal receiving remittance income has reached 76.8 percent. It also argues that it is a dramatic increase from 23.4 percent in 1996 and 56.8 percent in 2011. Nevertheless, it is not only inconsistent with the National Census 2021 data but also does not reflect the actual ground reality. Inferential flawsThe Census 2021 states that the total number of individuals absent from home, possibly to be in a foreign country, is only 2.169 million. It is next to impossible to receive remittances by 5.192 million (76.8 percent of 6.761 million households recognised by the Census) households sent by only 2.169 million migrating individuals, including seasonal absentees. Among them, even if only one individual from each household is considered out of home and remits the earnings back, only 32 percent of the households are likely to receive any kind of remittance. The direct positive correlation between the outmigration of individuals and remittance income can no way be undermined or ruled out.There were similar inconsistencies in NLSS-2011 and Census-2011. The Census stated that the population away from the country then was only 1.921 million, while the NLSS-III claimed that nearly 57 percent of the 5.7 million households benefitted from the remittance receipts. As such, which inferences and conclusions should people believe in and use‚Äîthe Census or the NLSS, both published by the same agency? There seems to be a great deal of confusion even in defining what essentially constitutes the 'remittance' for the purpose of this report.Even in determining the poverty line and poverty-related indicators‚Äîthe sole stated objective of the NLSS exercise‚Äîboth the data and inferences are messy, to say the least. It has adopted a new poverty line using 2022/23 as the base year. The updated line marginally increases the minimum income bar. A Nepali citizen is now classified as poor if her annual per capita total consumption expenditure is less than NRs72,908 annually, or Rs200 (USD 1.5 at 1 USD=NPR 133) per day. The report, at one instance, claims that Nepal has seen a significant reduction in poverty headcount over the last 12 years, from 25.16 percent in 2010-11 to 3.57 percent (vis-a-vis 2011 inflation-adjusted poverty line) in 2022-23. In the next paragraph, it says, ‚Äú20.27 percent of the population in Nepal lives below the new poverty line‚Äù.The definitional relation in practice between the 'headcount' and the 'poverty line' is that the 'national poverty headcount ratio is the percentage of the population living below the national poverty line.' Then how do the claims that poverty declined to 3.57 percent while 20.27 percent of the population still languish below the poverty line by earning only USD 1.5 dollars a day stand together? Regardless of these purely data doctoring or data cooking machinations, the critical question is: Whether the poverty rate actually declined in reality or not.Extrapolations and excusesThese are only a few examples of research by a government agency that is dependent on a small set of data while resources are disproportionately used in clever tabulation and preparation of politically convenient reports to show progress in critical topics like poverty reduction. No research finding should be only a circus of data overexploitation and far-fetched extrapolation like this. Whenever the discrepancies in research outcomes of government agencies are called out, the instant response is to point fingers towards methodological differences or biased perceptions. Also, the ‚Äúwe are the government‚Äù mindset runs deep to prove their findings as sacrosanct and beyond question.Nepal is pathetically handicapped in data-based research. There is a clear dearth of institutions in the country, academic or otherwise, that have the technical capacity and financial resources to carry out large-scale, nationwide research to counter the spuriousness of many such government surveys and research outcomes. International development partners, for instance, the World Bank, which has been supporting the NLSS endeavours since the beginning in 1995, have hardly paid any attention to the fact that the effective presence of autonomous research institutions out of government influence can better contribute to national policymaking. A plethora of survey-based research norms and practices, specifically in government-owned agencies, must change now.

What are the takeaways of the prime minister‚Äôs Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government‚Äôs decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country‚Äôs foreign policy doesn‚Äôt change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government‚Äôs priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn‚Äôt it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn‚Äôt affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country‚Äôs ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person‚Äôs affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn‚Äôt seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister‚Äôs New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister‚Äôs visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister‚Äôs visit doesn‚Äôt reflect any misgivings about the government‚Äôs decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn‚Äôt reflect that. Why aren‚Äôt we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry‚Äîthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country‚Äôs views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don‚Äôt see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats‚Äô relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don‚Äôt get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country‚Äôs influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let‚Äôs move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal‚Äôs recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister‚Äôs level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister‚Äôs emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal‚Äôs official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister‚Äôs Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons‚Äô Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report‚Äôs submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India‚Äôs facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour‚Äôs support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India‚Äôs infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal‚Äôs electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven‚Äôt developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don‚Äôt envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn‚Äôt the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects‚Äîdomestic as well as international use‚Äîof the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It‚Äôs been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why haven‚Äôt we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon. ","summary":"The government‚Äôs recent decision to recall ambassadors, particularly Nepal‚Äôs envoy to India, just ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal‚Äôs visit to New Delhi, courted widespread controversy. What are the takeaways of the prime minister‚Äôs Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government‚Äôs decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country‚Äôs foreign policy doesn‚Äôt change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government‚Äôs priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn‚Äôt it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn‚Äôt affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country‚Äôs ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person‚Äôs affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn‚Äôt seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister‚Äôs New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister‚Äôs visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister‚Äôs visit doesn‚Äôt reflect any misgivings about the government‚Äôs decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn‚Äôt reflect that. Why aren‚Äôt we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry‚Äîthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country‚Äôs views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don‚Äôt see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats‚Äô relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don‚Äôt get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country‚Äôs influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let‚Äôs move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal‚Äôs recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister‚Äôs level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister‚Äôs emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal‚Äôs official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister‚Äôs Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons‚Äô Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report‚Äôs submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India‚Äôs facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour‚Äôs support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India‚Äôs infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal‚Äôs electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework.

In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post‚Äôs Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let‚Äôs begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card‚Äîto open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards‚Äîone is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person‚Äôs activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories‚Äîdemographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data‚Äîfingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card‚ÄìNational ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‚Äòno, I have a National ID card‚Äô. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don‚Äôt ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don‚Äôt accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn‚Äôt help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal‚Äôs total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don‚Äôt need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn‚Äôt misused and it doesn‚Äôt make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don‚Äôt need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can‚Äôt be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‚Äòterrorised people‚Äô in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive‚Äôs completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven‚Äôt contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities‚Äô capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn‚Äôt need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors‚Äîbanking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don‚Äôt register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn‚Äôt misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn‚Äôt misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security‚ÄîL1, L2, L3‚Äîto ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS).
