Consequently, the Supreme Court overturned the suspension through an order of remand.\nWhat Are the Provisions of the Money Laundering Act and Parliamentary Regulation?\nSection 27 of the Money Laundering (Prevention) Act states: “A person holding any position in an organized institution established under prevailing law, or a government employee, or any public servant, shall be considered suspended during the period of detention under this Act, and until the completion of the case filed under Section 22, such person will remain suspended.” \nThis section mentions automatic suspension, which applies to MPs as well, meaning it does not require a letter from the police or notice from the Speaker. \nHowever, parliamentary regulations provide a slightly different arrangement.

   KATHMANDU:  In the past eleven months of 2024, the country registered the arrivals of over one million foreign tourists via flights.According to the Nepal Tourism Board, one million 55 thousand 533 tourists from outside the country visited Nepal between January and November 2024. They arrived by flight. The data shows that it has been challenging to meet the target of welcoming 1,315,000 tourists this year. \nThe NTB expects that around 70,000 foreigners will arrive in Nepal in the remaining one month as tourists and the number will be around 111,5000. \nHowever, in November alone, 114,000 tourists arrived in Nepal, and this figure is 5.40 percent more than the corresponding year in 2023.  \n NTB Director Maniraj Lamichhane said the analysis of the data so far suggests that the tourist arrivals this year compared to the previous year are likely to go by around 10 percent.

This has alarmed many UML leaders from the Oli camp. Last week, when Bhandari was in Pokhara for a couple of days, she met scores of UML leaders in the lake city. Such activities are taken as her prelude to rejoining party politics.Before becoming President, she was Oli’s one of the most trusted leaders in the party, and Oli was the one who promoted Bhandari to the country’s top post in October 2015.Unhappy with Oli’s activities or feeling excluded from the party chief’s team, some leaders like Gokul Baskota and Karna Thapa, who were among close confidants of Oli, are now distancing themselves from the party chief. They are also reportedly lobbying to bring Bhandari back to party leadership. Thapa has publicly advocated Bhandari's return to active politics.Dissatisfaction of Baskota, who was earlier taken as a member of Oli’s kitchen cabinet, became public earlier this month when he formed a parallel committee of the party’s student wing in his home district, Kavrepalanchok, challenging the party establishment.A central secretariat meeting of the UML last week expelled former party vice-chair Bhim Rawal and suspended standing committee member Binda Pandey and central committee member Usha Timilsena. Notably, Pandey was always with Oli when there were factional divisions in the party on certain issues. After the suspension, Pandey has publicly claimed she was suspended with Oli’s direct intervention. She had recently criticised the party chair’s decision to accept a tract of pricey land as donation from a controversial businessman to build the party office.According to multiple party leaders, several dissatisfied leaders have approached Bhandari and urged her to rejoin active politics with a plan to take over the UML leadership.“Many party leaders have reached out to Bhandari after feeling alienated by party chair Oli,” a UML leader said. “These leaders have been urging Bhandari to rejoin politics as she still has time to be politically productive.” Sarita Neupane, a UML central committee member, agrees. Given her age, 63, she could still participate in politics, Neupane said. “Her active participation could benefit the party,” Neupane told the Post. Former lawmaker of the House of Representatives Krishna Bahadur Rai, who is also close to Bhandari, says it all depends on former President Bhandari whether to resume active politics.Some leaders close to Oli say those who are unhappy with the party chief have been fuelling her ambitions, promising to help her be party chief. “These promises from some leaders have boosted Bhandari’s aspirations,” a leader close to Oli said. Vice-chair Bishnu Paudel; deputy general secretary Prithvi Subba Gurung; politburo members Gokul Baskota, Karna Thapa, Krishna Bahadur Rai; and central committee member Sarita Neupane are among those urging Bhandari to rejoin active politics, according to UML insiders. But in public vice-chair Paudel reiterates that Oli will be the chair at least one more time. Bishal Bhattarai, a UML politburo member, argues that visiting the residence of former President Bhandari or meeting her alone should not be construed as political maneuvering. “I, too, have gone to meet her quite a few times,” Bhattarai said. Many reckon vice-chair Paudel is not comfortable with growing chances of Shankar Pokharel, the party general secretary, leading the party after Oli. “This is why Paudel is keeping his options open,” said a leader from the Oli faction. But another leader dismisses such claims. In the party hierarchy, Paudel is senior to Pokharel and so there is no reason for Paudel to be uncomfortable with Pokharel, the leader claimed. Bishnu Rijal, a central committee member, rubbishes the claim that party members are unhappy with the current leadership. “The party is not thinking beyond Chair Oli for a few more years,” Rijal said.The issue of Bhandari returning to active politics was discussed during the two-day workshop held on December 14-15 at the party central office at Chaysal, Lalitpur. Neupane said that Oli at the event appeared positive about a possible return of the former President to active politics. “The party chair had said that if the former president rejoined active politics, it would create a positive environment in the party.” Another party leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, claimed that Bhandari would not return to party politics in a way that she has to engage in a direct tussle with the party chair.There is a section of leaders who blame both Bhandari and Oli of causing damage to the UML during their terms as President and prime minister. “Prime Minister Oli dissolved the House of Representatives twice, and President Bhandari approved it promptly, which is a clear example of their failed leadership,” the anonymous party leader said. On December 20, 2020, and May 21, 2021, Oli twice dissolved the Parliament, which President Bhandari approved. According to an aide, Bhandari has recently renewed her UML membership. Some leaders said factional rivalry between vice-chair Paudel and general secretary Pokhrel made them think about Bhandari as Oli’s successor as she can be a leader acceptable to both sides.There have been instances that when the party general secretary appeared close to Oli, vice-chair Paudel supported President Bhandari, hinting at factionalism within the party. In UML provincial conventions earlier this year when Oli backed Pokhrel, Bhandari reportedly sided with Paudel.Rai, who is close to Bhandari, also acknowledges factional activities in the party. “Perhaps party members do not accept either Paudel or Pokhrel,” he says. “In such a condition the party should have a leader who would be accepted to all,” Rai said. “For that, Bhandari could be an option.” ","summary":"Although not overtly visible, discontent is brewing within the CPN-UML with party chair KP Sharma Oli apparently losing grip even within his own faction, recent developments suggest.Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari, who is also former vice-chair of the UML, has stepped up her activities in recent months.

Former lawmaker of the House of Representatives Krishna Bahadur Rai, who is also close to Bhandari, says it all depends on former President Bhandari whether to resume active politics.Some leaders close to Oli say those who are unhappy with the party chief have been fuelling her ambitions, promising to help her be party chief. “These promises from some leaders have boosted Bhandari’s aspirations,” a leader close to Oli said. Vice-chair Bishnu Paudel; deputy general secretary Prithvi Subba Gurung; politburo members Gokul Baskota, Karna Thapa, Krishna Bahadur Rai; and central committee member Sarita Neupane are among those urging Bhandari to rejoin active politics, according to UML insiders. But in public vice-chair Paudel reiterates that Oli will be the chair at least one more time. Bishal Bhattarai, a UML politburo member, argues that visiting the residence of former President Bhandari or meeting her alone should not be construed as political maneuvering. “I, too, have gone to meet her quite a few times,” Bhattarai said. Many reckon vice-chair Paudel is not comfortable with growing chances of Shankar Pokharel, the party general secretary, leading the party after Oli. “This is why Paudel is keeping his options open,” said a leader from the Oli faction. But another leader dismisses such claims. In the party hierarchy, Paudel is senior to Pokharel and so there is no reason for Paudel to be uncomfortable with Pokharel, the leader claimed. Bishnu Rijal, a central committee member, rubbishes the claim that party members are unhappy with the current leadership. “The party is not thinking beyond Chair Oli for a few more years,” Rijal said.The issue of Bhandari returning to active politics was discussed during the two-day workshop held on December 14-15 at the party central office at Chaysal, Lalitpur. Neupane said that Oli at the event appeared positive about a possible return of the former President to active politics. “The party chair had said that if the former president rejoined active politics, it would create a positive environment in the party.” Another party leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, claimed that Bhandari would not return to party politics in a way that she has to engage in a direct tussle with the party chair.There is a section of leaders who blame both Bhandari and Oli of causing damage to the UML during their terms as President and prime minister. “Prime Minister Oli dissolved the House of Representatives twice, and President Bhandari approved it promptly, which is a clear example of their failed leadership,” the anonymous party leader said. On December 20, 2020, and May 21, 2021, Oli twice dissolved the Parliament, which President Bhandari approved. According to an aide, Bhandari has recently renewed her UML membership. Some leaders said factional rivalry between vice-chair Paudel and general secretary Pokhrel made them think about Bhandari as Oli’s successor as she can be a leader acceptable to both sides.There have been instances that when the party general secretary appeared close to Oli, vice-chair Paudel supported President Bhandari, hinting at factionalism within the party. In UML provincial conventions earlier this year when Oli backed Pokhrel, Bhandari reportedly sided with Paudel.Rai, who is close to Bhandari, also acknowledges factional activities in the party. “Perhaps party members do not accept either Paudel or Pokhrel,” he says. “In such a condition the party should have a leader who would be accepted to all,” Rai said. “For that, Bhandari could be an option.” "},{"hash":"bdb73d003bff726d37d470077ac4e4d36f3b0dafe085364f4c0d3d64d6f991aa","title":"nepal-confirms-third-mpox-case-experts-warn-of-possible-spread","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/health/2024/12/31/nepal-confirms-third-mpox-case-experts-warn-of-possible-spread","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/monkey-1735606549.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1735603200000,"source":"kp","category":"health","content":"Nepal has confirmed its third case of mpox. According to officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, a 44-year-old migrant worker from Sindhuli district who returned from Saudi Arabia tested positive for the potentially deadly disease on Sunday. “The infected person sought treatment upon his arrival on Saturday,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the division. “The test result confirmed that the man is infected with mpox virus.”This is the second mpox-positive case among Saudi Arabia returnee migrant workers in the past 10 days. Earlier, on December 20, a 36-year-old man from Tanahun district also tested positive for the virus.Nepal confirmed its first case of mpox infection in June last year, when a 60-year-old foreign national tested positive.So far, all three positive cases of the mpox virus have been detected in migrant workers or travellers returning from disease-hit countries.Experts warned of the risk of the deadly virus spilling over into communities, as hundreds of international travellers, including migrant workers, return to the country every day.“The incubation period for the virus is 5 to 21 days, and not all infected persons show symptoms,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit of the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “Asymptomatic but infected persons can easily pass the virus to their spouse and other family members. What we should not forget is that only those with symptoms seek care. Others go home directly.”Along with sexual transmission, the deadly disease can be transmitted through respiratory droplets, to children through skin-to-skin contact with caregivers, as well as through needle injuries and occupational exposures due to a lack of personal protective measures.“We are aware of the risk of spillover of the virus into communities,” said Ghimire, the director of the disease control body. “We have already stepped up surveillance at health desks at international airports. We are also in discussions with partner agencies to implement further measures to reduce the risk of disease spillover into communities.”Public health experts in Nepal say that screening at health desks at international airports and land crossings is not sufficient to prevent outbreaks, as the first symptoms of mpox can take between five and 21 days to appear, and not all cases can be detected at health desks.Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with the mpox virus. Monkeypox cases have been reported in neighbouring India, with which Nepal shares a long, porous border. India has recorded at least 30 mpox infections since 2022.Health experts say that even though mpox is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the risks should not be underestimated. They stress the importance of precautions, saying that any disease seen in any corner of the world can reach Nepal due to the high mobility of people.Since 2022, mpox has spread globally. More than 100,000 people from 122 countries have already tested positive for the disease.Its symptoms include fever, headache, swelling, body aches, sore throat, muscle aches, back pain, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.The UN health body said that mpox is treated with supportive care for symptoms such as pain and fever, with close attention to nutrition, hydration, skin care, prevention of secondary infections, and treatment of co-infections. As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to prevent transmission.

At the time, Jimmy Carter was the US President. Nepal-US relations were normal even as President Carter had given priority to the issue of human rights. Several countries were struggling to safeguard human rights. President Carter wanted to reinvigorate this issue, which was also his first foreign policy priority.At that time, Nepal was also in focus due to the agitation by the political parties for the restoration of democracy. Around the same time, Nepal went for a referendum, giving people a choice between multiparty democracy or continuation of the Panchayat system. People voted in favour of an improvised Panchayat system and an agenda of restoration of democracy. Both the sides, Nepal and the US, were committing to promote the human rights situation in Nepal. The outside world was also convinced that Nepal is giving priority to safeguard human rights even at a time the country was in a political conflict. When King Birendra requested me to be the ambassador of the United States, it was my priority to appraise the Americans about the situation in Nepal as well as how the government of Nepal was dealing with it in a practical way. Our priority was also to rightly evaluate the economic, social and political situations in Nepal and communicate them to the American side. Likewise, another instruction (probably from the palace) was to tell Americans to look at Nepal through its own eyes, not through the lens of others. Yet another instruction was to prioritise bilateral talks between Nepal and the US and to improve the cold relations between Kathmandu and Washington DC. At that time I was preparing to set up a new organisation with my friends, whereby we wanted to contribute to Nepal’s economic and social development.I left for the United States with my family after the sudden opportunity offered by the king. After reaching the US, we managed to present credentials. During the presentation of credentials, the ambassador could take his entire family to the White House, which was unique to the US.The date and time for presenting credentials to the US president was fixed. After presenting my credentials to President Carter, he expressed his views about Nepal. He also spoke with my family members and then we briefly met over the tea reception. President Carter said that the US would strengthen its relations with Nepal and give priority to economic assistance and promotion of human rights. The time for presenting credentials (envoys from other countries were also there) was one hour. It was clear that the US wanted to strengthen relations with Nepal while playing a very constructive role. During the official and formal programs in DC, it was my impression that US-Nepal ties were cordial with few differences.During Carter’s tenure, it was widely thought that his presidency would pursue the same policy with big and small nations. But in that first meeting, I found President Carter simple and friendly. He had studied a lot and had interest in Nepal’s northern belt as well as the hilly regions. President Carter had given priority to his own country, America’s closest neighbours and those with which America had strategic ties. In general, he gave priority to American security and economic progress but engagement with the rest of the world was based on different evaluation. For a diplomat, it was rare to have such frank conversation with the US president. During the conversation, he kept talking about wanting to climb Nepal’s mountains and hills. During Carter’s four years, I contacted some US policymakers, among them Zbigniew Kazimierz Brzeziński who was the National Security Advisor to President Carter (1977 to 1981). We played tennis together and cultivated deep relations. Through his connection, I used to get informed about the US relations and its policy towards the rest of the world. More than bilateral relations, I used to get informed time and again about changing global scenarios, US strategic views and other matters. Our relationship was smooth. But time and again, US security agencies kept telling us to prioritise democracy in Nepal, not depend on foreign aid and assistance and kept suggesting we focus on internal management. During the four years of President Carter, Nepal-US relations ran smoothly and we did not face any bitter experience.One day, Carter’s national security advisor told me that at the end of his tenure, President Carter wanted to communicate with the leaders of 20 countries. Accordingly, Carter had a conversation with the Nepali king at the end of his presidency. During his term, one member of the US national security agency had told me that the president and his wife wanted to go to Nepal on a private visit and to trek Nepal's hilly region.If he makes up his mind, he and his wife will call you one day, the member of the US national security agency told me. The visit will not be a political one and will focus on trekking in Nepal’s hilly region as well in the northern belt, the official told me. If he is interested to visit Nepal, the Nepali Embassy will cooperate, I replied, which would also strengthen bilateral ties and create a good foundation to nurture bilateral relations.After President Carter retired, he called me to his hometown Atlanta. I arranged my schedule, went to Atlanta and stayed in a hotel near his residence. I stayed there for two days and discussed his visit to Nepal, where he wanted to go and whom he wanted to meet. His priority was Nepal’s northern belt, specifically around Mt Everest, and he wanted to meet the people in that area.After that meeting, we fixed that his visit would focus in Kathmandu and around Mt Everest. Before meeting me, he had extensively studied Nepal, Mt Everest and the locality. Then we came to Kathmandu and met King Birendra at the royal palace. He had the same perspective on foreign policy and affection towards Nepal, in or out of presidency. He was the only former US president to visit Nepal.In my understanding, President Carter was simple, had a deep understanding about global peace and always believed the humanitarian aspect should be prioritised for global peace. He was of the view that the Cold War should not be continued and strategic interest should not harm the humanitarian cause.He always said that world peace should not be disturbed by strategic rivalry and the humanitarian aspect should be prioritised. In the end, I would like to pay tribute to a person who throughout his 100 years of life lived positively and always worked in favour of peace and progress.

He presided over a tumultuous period in American history from 1977 to 1981, working hard to restore trust in government after the Watergate scandal and the divisive era of the Vietnam War. He brokered a landmark peace deal between Israel and Egypt and negotiated a historic treaty to hand over the Panama Canal to Panama.Carter, a champion of human rights both in the US and around the world, passed away at 100 on December 29, 2024. More than any recent American president, Carter pressed gently but firmly on autocratic regimes worldwide to respect human rights and the rule of law. When he led the country with immense moral authority, it encouraged many human rights advocates, while dictators worried about the US sanctions.At home, Carter got many progressive legislations passed in areas of consumer protection, welfare reforms and the appointment of women and minorities in America’s judiciary. However, he had difficulties managing the US economy, the Iran hostage crisis and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. And in the 1980 Presidential election, when he lost his bid to Ronald Reagan, his active political career came to an end.But he didn’t retire to a comfortable life, rather, he embarked on a noble mission as one of the world’s highly respected elder statesmen, deeply committed to promoting democracy and human rights. He founded the Carter Center with a motto of “Waging Peace, Fighting Disease and Building Hope”. With his team, he worked tirelessly to help resolve conflicts, monitor elections and improve human health through campaigns to eliminate several neglected diseases afflicting the poorest people worldwide, particularly in Africa.“For his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights and to promote economic and social development,” Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.Links with UNICEF and NepalCarter greatly admired UNICEF Executive Director James Grant and strongly supported the UNICEF-led global child survival and development campaign. Further, the organisation was a key partner in the Carter-led global campaign to eradicate a debilitating disease called dracunculiasis or Guinea-worm disease.My first substantive meeting with Carter took place on August 3, 1995, at an event in Washington, DC, organised jointly by the Carter Center, USAID, WHO and UNICEF to mark the 95 percent reduction in Guinea worm cases worldwide and to recommit to its total eradication. I had a long and fruitful discussion with Carter on strengthening our collaboration in the global campaign to eradicate Guinea-worm disease. In February 2004, I joined President Carter and WHO Director-General JW Lee on a 3-day field visit to observe and advocate for Guinea-worm eradication in Ghana. I learned about Carter’s humble personality, deep commitment to many worthy causes and impressive advocacy skills. In our informal interactions, we often talked about Nepal.Carter’s involvement in NepalCarter visited Nepal twice to observe Nepal’s Constituent Assembly Elections. He advised Nepali leaders, including the Election Commission, based on his worldwide experience and credibility in observing elections and conflict resolution. Over the years, the Carter Center produced several reports on Nepal dealing with issues related to the peace process, challenges in drafting Nepal’s Constitution and other important issues of social justice and equity. I instinctively supported Carter’s noble efforts to promote peace, democracy and development. However, like everybody else, Carter was human and fallible, and some aspects of the Carter Center’s reports on Nepal were flawed. In particular, Carter’s hasty verdict that Nepal’s first Constituent Assembly election was free, fair and peaceful ignored the fact that there was an unusually high degree of intimidation in many rural constituencies. The non-Maoist parties’ candidates were prevented from campaigning, and voters were threatened with physical violence for weeks preceding the actual voting. There were well-intentioned but inaccurate analyses of Nepal’s socio-political dynamics by the Carter Center, the International Crisis Group, and even the United Nations. In their effort to appear “balanced and even-handed”, they gave the undue benefit of the doubt to the progressive-sounding rhetoric of the Maoists, ignoring their violent and corrupt practices. Carter witnessed the insincerity and duplicity of the Maoists when they initially welcomed the 2013 election for the second Constituent Assembly but then denounced it as rigged and unfair when the results showed that they had suffered a humiliating loss. Unlike during the first CA election, Carter took the necessary time to analyse the second CA election better. He left somewhat sobered by a deeper understanding of the Maoists’ opportunistic and undemocratic nature. A man of faith and integrityJimmy Carter was a deeply religious and spiritual man who often turned to his faith during his political career. But as a progressive man and defender of human rights and gender equality, he found himself at odds with his Southern Baptist Church when it opposed gender equality, citing a few selected verses from the Bible that women must be “subservient” to their husbands and must not be allowed to serve as priests. Carter protested and took a painful decision to sever ties with his Baptist Church, saying that parts of its rigid doctrine violated the basic premises of his Christian faith. He wrote to his fellow Baptists and published an op-ed article “Losing my religion for equality”. Carter had a philosophical and spiritual perspective on death. As he suffered from multiple bouts of cancer treatment, he remarked, “I didn’t ask God to let me live, but I just asked God to give me a proper attitude toward death. I found that I was absolutely and completely at ease with death”. May Carter’s noble soul rest in eternal peace.  ","summary":"Former American President Jimmy Carter was a man of peace and principles.

He was a key architect of India’s economic liberalisation as finance minister from 1991 to 1996. Indian and global media have flooded their stories with his major policy reforms that rescued the Indian economy from the brink of collapse in 1991, lifted millions from abject poverty, and transformed India into a global economic powerhouse, which is aiming to be the third-largest economy within the next few years. According to The BBC, Singh changed the country’s growth trajectory during his two consecutive terms as prime minister between 2004 and 2014.Prime Minister Narendra Modi was short of acknowledging him as the quintessential economic reformer in Indian history. Nonetheless, he paid a generous tribute to Singh, who belonged to the opposition Indian National Congress party.India’s economic growth in the post-independence era of 1950-1990 was constricted to an average annual rate of 4 percent. It was often satirically termed the socialist rate of growth, or the Bharatiya rate of growth, or even the Hindu rate of growth. Some competitive growth statistics only confirm that. For example, the average per capita gross domestic product (GDP per capita) of China ($90) and India ($83) was almost similar in 1960. It didn’t differ significantly until 1990, when China’s GDP per capita was $318, against India’s $304. China surpassed the $1,000 mark in 2000, but India had to wait another decade to meet the same milestone. China’s national GDP grew from $60 billion in 1960 to $17.81 trillion in 2023, while India, with $37 billion in 1960, could only rise to $3.55 trillion in 2023.Power of reformSeveral bold reforms were initiated in 1991, such as the freedom to enterprise from the infamous “Licence Raj”, the devaluation of the Indian currency against the dollar, the liberalisation of interest rates, making the capital accounts (partially) convertible and ensuring autonomy of the regulatory authorities in financial sectors, among others. These were critical in unleashing the growth potential, and successive governments, even from different ideological orientations, continued this momentum of comprehensive structural reforms. Consequently, India is now pursuing a lofty dream of making the size of its economy equal to that of China by 2050. Some extrapolations have projected the Chinese economy to be the largest, worth at least $42 trillion, the Unites States’ economy to be the second largest, worth $37 trillion, and the Indian economy to be the third largest, worth $23 trillion. The current political leadership hopes to double that size. These aspirations are undoubtedly contingent on the continuation and expansion of these reforms.The answer to why India, Nepal and other countries lagged behind China in economic prosperity remains in the power and direction of economic reform.The growth of these countries began to unfold late, which delayed their reform. China started its market reform, mainly opening the door for foreign investment and allowing individual entrepreneurs to start businesses in 1980, a decade before India. Therefore, China started to reap the benefits from the early 90s, while India had to wait another decade. The difference in the size of the national GDP of these two countries reflects the missed opportunity cost of India’s late start.The impressive growth saga of four Asian tigers—Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea—from the 1970s to 1990s was also driven by the private sector and openness-oriented reforms. Rapid industrialisation, adoption of state-of-the-art technology and exports helped them steadily retain an average 7.5 percent economic growth rate for three decades, eventually listing them in the ‘richest countries in the world’ club. After the turn of the century, Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand followed suit. But the magic fulcrum for this growth is unequivocal reform. For poor and developing countries, including China and India, the unfortunate part was that the governments failed to underscore the importance of legal and institutional reforms and emulate their success stories during those decades.Nepal and reformEconomic reforms in India and Nepal started almost simultaneously—at the beginning of the 1990s. The Indian reform process, by and large, did not falter. But Nepal vacillated within years. In 1995, the communist government came into power with a crude socialist hangover, making populism and pork-barrel distribution its policy mainstay. The country then reeled under a decade-long insurgency (1996-2006), only to bring another radical Maoist ideology to the political mainstream. The obvious consequence was a reversal of reform policies like ‘reconsidering’ the privatisation of loss-making public enterprises, adopting more distributive policies without ascertaining fund sources and creating a stronger narrative of a socialist-oriented economy.In some areas, such as private investment and banking, the economic and fiscal reform delivered impressive results. At present, the Nepali economy cannot be imagined without duly recognising private investment’s impact on the growth and expansion of sectors like hydropower, banking and insurance, aviation, transport, tourism, telecommunications and information technology, education, health services, pharmaceuticals and retail markets.Despite these tangible reform outcomes, the Nepali state is still hesitant to undertake comprehensive structural reform. Legal reform at the federal level is too tardy, piecemeal and fragmented. The institutional efficiency of the bureaucracy has constantly remained suboptimal, warranting a different strategy from hiring and training to deputation. The model of policy reform for financial management and economic development at the subnational level is yet to be charted out. As the developing world now considers a ‘Second Generation of Economic Reforms’, with a lag of at least two decades, the foundations laid by Manmohan Singh in India, Ram Sharan Mahat and team in Nepal, and Deng Xiaoping in China through what may be called the first generation of reform remains valuable. Needless to say, the reform and growth of the Indian economy and its lessons are always critical to the Nepali economy as they are inseparably intertwined.A true tribute to Manmohan Singh would be to keep the reform momentum he courageously embarked upon alive. Two recent books, Backstage: The Story Behind India's High Growth Years by Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Portraits of Power: Half a Century of Being at Ringside by NK Singh, two Sherpas in senior Singh’s reform journey, provide a valuable reference to the context and challenges of economic reform in the context of Nepal and the South Asian region as a whole.  ","summary":"Former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, known as the ‘reforms man’, died last Thursday.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the United States has made available $3.4 billion in additional budget aid to Ukraine, giving the war-torn country critical resources amid intensifying Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure.“At my direction, the United States will continue to work relentlessly to strengthen Ukraine’s position in this war over the remainder of my time in office,” Biden said in a statement.Biden’s announcement includes $1.25 billion in military aid drawn from US stockpiles and a $1.22 billion Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) package, the final USAI package of Biden's time in office.Under USAI, military equipment is procured from the defense industry or partners, rather than drawn from American stocks, meaning it can take months or years to arrive on the battlefield.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is approaching the three-year mark and recently the Russians have used North Korean troops to bolster their fighting position.North Korean forces are experiencing mass casualties on the front lines of Russia's war against Ukraine, with 1,000 of their troops killed or wounded in the last week alone in Russia's Kursk region, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Friday.Biden said the new assistance will provide Ukraine with “an immediate influx of capabilities that it continues to use to great effect on the battlefield and longer-term supplies of air defense, artillery, and other critical weapons systems.”Nearly three years into the war, Washington has committed billions in aid for Ukraine, but it is uncertain if the aid will continue at that pace under Trump, who replaces Biden on January 20.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the United States has made available $3.4 billion in additional budget aid to Ukraine, giving the war-torn country critical resources amid intensifying Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure.“At my direction, the United States will continue to work relentlessly to strengthen Ukraine’s position in this war over the remainder of my time in office,” Biden said in a statement.Biden’s announcement includes $1.25 billion in military aid drawn from US stockpiles and a $1.22 billion Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) package, the final USAI package of Biden's time in office.Under USAI, military equipment is procured from the defense industry or partners, rather than drawn from American stocks, meaning it can take months or years to arrive on the battlefield.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is approaching the three-year mark and recently the Russians have used North Korean troops to bolster their fighting position.North Korean forces are experiencing mass casualties on the front lines of Russia's war against Ukraine, with 1,000 of their troops killed or wounded in the last week alone in Russia's Kursk region, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Friday.Biden said the new assistance will provide Ukraine with “an immediate influx of capabilities that it continues to use to great effect on the battlefield and longer-term supplies of air defense, artillery, and other critical weapons systems.”Nearly three years into the war, Washington has committed billions in aid for Ukraine, but it is uncertain if the aid will continue at that pace under Trump, who replaces Biden on January 20.

From 2015 to 2018, the shadowy deal to pocket multi-million dollar bribes was orchestrated. The shady process followed a long sequence: The RFP draft was prepared. It was then sent to AAR Corp to manipulate its clauses to win the bid. The document was returned to Nepal Airlines, and the RFP was issued. After that, the supply contract was signed, following which the plane supplier was changed.After the change of supplier, many shady intermediary companies were opened to distribute the bribes.The SEC made the document public on December 19. In 2015, Nepal Airlines received a nod from its board to buy two wide-body jets from Airbus, the European aviation giant, after receiving two narrow bodies of the Airbus A320 aircraft.The decision followed its management’s recommendation to switch to Airbus from Boeing as pursuing a one-family aircraft strategy would reduce maintenance and crew training costs. On September 26, 2016, the national flag carrier invited sealed requests for proposal (RFP) from aircraft manufacturing companies, airlines, aircraft leasing companies and bankers to purchase two A330-200 jets. The $209.6-million plane purchase deal was the largest in Nepal’s aviation history.In 2015, Deepak Sharma, 46, a Nepali-born British citizen, was hired as president of the International Supply Chain for an AAR subsidiary. At the time, Sharma suggested he could help secure the Nepal Airlines deal. Upon arriving at AAR, Sharma pursued the opportunity as the lead employee responsible for winning the Nepal Airlines contract, reporting directly to an AAR executive.Sharma, the president of the AAR subsidiary, had been in charge from November 2015 until his suspension in April 2019— when Kansakar orchestrated the plan.In March 2016, Sharma secured and shared internally at AAR an unpublished draft of the RFP for AAR executives to “comment on” and “change any terms to suit AAR.” As a result, Sharma and others at AAR proposed changes to the draft RFP to benefit AAR in the bidding process. According to the document, a few months later, Sharma “emailed the Nepal Airlines’ Managing Director adding specifications to the RFP, and then forwarded this email internally,” writing that the “way this RFP is going no one else will qualify to bid except AAR.” The bid documents said the minimum age of the proposed aircraft could not be more than 1,000 flight hours, and the date of manufacture should not be before January 2014. The intent was to keep the manufacturer Airbus out of the race as it could not deliver used planes and other bidders could not meet the specifications outlined in the bid document.On September 26, 2016, the RFP was officially published. Upon publication, Sharma reported in an internal email that the RFP was “designed for us.”When the final deadline ended on November 10, 2016, eleven international firms submitted bids to supply two long-range wide-body passenger jets to Nepal Airlines. The suppliers were Rolls-Royce, KL AeroParts, Aircraft Investment Group, Crown Commercial Services, Synergy Aerospace, ST Aerospace, Le Group Delta, AAR Corporation, Surya Air Support, KJT Investment & One World Closeouts and Ron Motta Associates Aircraft Sales & Parts. Rolls-Royce had applied to supply the aircraft engine.Sharma’s internal communications to AAR personnel suggested that Nepal Airlines request for proposal (“RFP”) would be drafted to favour AAR. For example, on November 22, 2015, Sharma sent an internal email conveying that he had a “good meeting” with the “CEO of [Nepal] airlines” and that the RFP for the transaction would be drafted in favour of the AAR. In a follow-up December internal email, Sharma forwarded the email correspondence between himself and Nepal Airlines’ Managing Director Kansakar, adding that the Managing Director was “100 percent relying on us to bid and win this aircraft sales” contract.Soon after the RFP was published, Sharma discussed internally the need to engage third-party Agents [a Hong Kong corporation, controlled by a German corporation and a Portuguese charter airline, and purportedly involved in the telecom business] as an agent on the Nepal Airlines transaction. In doing so, Sharma noted that he would “pull all political strings in Nepal” and that setting up a foreign representative agreement (FRA) with Hong Kong corporation would help “lock… in” the Nepal Airlines deal. The Hong Kong corporation, purportedly a telecom business, was engaged by an AAR subsidiary despite red flags raised during due diligence. AAR's due diligence flagged that the Hong Kong corporation lacked any aviation industry experience and had limited and vague descriptions of the services it would provide.Two customer references provided by the Hong Kong corporation involve sales of cell phones and electronics.As a part of the scheme, the AAR subsidiary retained the Hong Kong corporation, whose role was to bribe officials who had control over the Nepal Airlines contract. AAR terminated its relationship with the Hong Kong corporation before the transaction’s closing, resulting in Sharma arranging to have the German corporation pay the Hong Kong corporation and its successor entity—another Dubai-based entity incorporated in the UAE—a success fee for winning the Nepal Airlines contract.On November 1, 2016, the Hong Kong corporation was officially engaged under the Foreign Representative Agreement (FRA). Under the FRA, the corporation would get a commission payment of 7 percent of the final sales price of the two aircraft, and the commission payment was estimated to be between $9.6 million and $14.6 million. On November 8, 2016, the AAR subsidiary formed a consortium through a framework agreement with the German corporation and the Portuguese charter airline (collectively the “AAR Consortium”) to submit a bid on the Nepal Airlines RFP. Under the initial structure, AAR would provide the aircraft, the German corporation would offer financing, and the Portuguese charter airline would provide services, spare parts, and tooling. The German corporation would use a Special Purpose Vehicle to buy the two A330 aircraft from Airbus, and the Special Purpose Vehicle would then sell the aircraft to AAR, which in turn would sell the aircraft to Nepal Airlines. AAR estimated it would make between $8 million and $12 million from that transaction structure.On November 9, 2016, the AAR Consortium submitted its bid in response to the RFP. In the cover letter for the bid, Sharma addressed Nepal Airlines Managing Director Kansakar. The next day, Sharma texted an AAR executive, “We got the Nepal deal.”On December 1, 2016, AAR executives learned from Sharma that the money going to the German corporation would be used to “donate to Nepal's political parties” as part of the Nepal Airlines deal. On December 4, 2016, AAR received an anonymous email alleging bribery in the Nepal Airlines deal. After learning from Sharma that the German corporation would be making these payments, AAR terminated the German corporation on December 9, 2016. On January 16, 2017, Nepal Airlines notified AAR that its board had approved the AAR Consortium’s bid.On January 27, 2017, Nepal Airlines signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with AAR Corp to buy two Airbus A330-200 long-range jets. The airline then planned to pay AAR Corp a $1 million “commitment fee” within two to three days to formally confirm the order.Kansakar told the Post at that time that AAR, the American aviation support company, quoted an “offer price” of $104.8 million for each jet. “However, the ‘contract price’ may differ slightly in the purchase agreement.” When AAR terminated the German corporation on December 9, 2016, the delivery date and the supplier were abruptly changed.Subsequently, the national flag carrier told the Nepali media its fleet expansion plan would be delayed by three months.As per the revised schedule, Nepal Airlines was to receive the first aircraft by January 2018.According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission document, the initial supply plan was restructured so that the Special Purpose Vehicle would buy the two A330s from Airbus. Rather than selling them to AAR, the vehicle would sell the aircraft directly to Nepal Airlines.To negotiate the transaction, AAR would receive a $6 million commission (rather than the originally planned $9.6-14.6 million).As part of the termination of the FRA, the AAR subsidiary and the Hong Kong corporation executed a termination of the German corporation, and there was a separate fee agreement that provided the Hong Kong corporation with $250,000 as “full payment” for its time and costs associated with its efforts relating to the sale of [the] aircraft”.Sharma subsequently put in place a May 2017 agreement between the Hong Kong corporation and the German corporation under which the German corporation would pay its Hong Kong counterpart a commission of $4 million per aircraft ($8 million total).The agreement was backdated to October 7, 2016 to make it look like it was in place when the AAR Consortium placed its bid.A subsequent July 2017 agreement replaced the German corporation with the Special Purpose Vehicle, making it responsible for paying the relevant sales commission to the Hong Kong corporation.However, when the Nepal Airlines transaction closed, the terminated German corporation’s payments (through the Special Purpose Vehicle) to the Hong Kong corporation were blocked due to the “Know Your Customer” rules of the Hong Kong corporation’s bank.This resulted in Sharma working with a Nepali national to set up a new Dubai-based company to receive payments from the German corporation.The Dubai-based entity was incorporated on October 22, 2017 with one of its two shareholders being the son of a Nepali national.In 2018, AAR paid the Hong Kong corporation $250,000 in commission via a wire transfer through at least one US correspondent bank, and the German corporation and Dubai-based entity were paid $2.6 million.While the payment to the Hong Kong corporation was part of the bribery scheme and the AAR subsidiary lacked documentary evidence reflecting any legitimate services provided by the corporation, the AAR subsidiary recorded $250,000 as a legitimate commission expense.AAR failed to devise and maintain internal accounting controls related to vendor management and accounts payable sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that AAR personnel were adhering to AAR’s Global Anti-Corruption Policy and its procedures on the retention of and payments to third-party agents.In August 2024, in connection with the Nepal Airlines scam, Sharma pleaded guilty to a one-count criminal information filed in the US, charging him with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).AAR agreed to pay more than $55 million to resolve investigations by the US Justice Department and the US Securities and Exchange Commission into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits bribe payments to foreign government officials.According to the US Justice Department, AAR obtained profits of nearly $24 million as a result of the scheme.Sharma pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit around $130,000. His sentences are yet to be determined in the US court, so this case is ongoing.

Experts say such a jurisdiction issue may spill over to other national parks if this issue is not handled well. The federal government, however, has not taken the matter seriously.On December 12, the Sagarmatha National Park, which houses the world’s tallest peak, issued directives restricting commercial choppers from flying over it. On December 13, the civil aviation regulator responded that the park has no legal ground to enforce such a ban.After three days, on Monday, the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, the local federal unit, issued a strongly worded statement against commercial chopper operations in the Everest region.“We request the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal and all travel agencies operating within this rural municipality to refrain from booking or selling any packages that include helicopter flights for the Khumbu region,” according to the statement. “If any individual or agency engages in such activities after this notice, and if it causes any obstacles or issues in this region, the rural municipality will not be held accountable. This press release has been issued to inform all concerned parties.”The municipality added: “Beyond Lukla, only rescue and sling flights that comply with the laws and regulations of Sagarmatha National Park will be allowed. All other commercial helicopter flights will be banned entirely from January 1.”As per the rural municipality directive, a recommendation must be obtained from the health institution at the flight site for emergency rescues. A health professional must be present on the flight. If further treatment outside the region is required, patients must undergo a test at Pasanglhamu Nicole Niquille Hospital in Lukla and get a mandatory recommendation from the hospital. “Henceforth, only rescue and sling flights in compliance with the laws and regulations of Sagarmatha National Park will be permitted beyond Lukla,” the municipal statement reads.The statement comes in response to one by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, which vowed not to follow the rules imposed by the national park and asked the helicopter companies to continue with their regular flights. The immediate concern raised by the park is severe noise pollution caused by frequent helicopter flights over the area. The noise disturbs animals, which rely on the park’s relatively undisturbed natural environment. Excess noise can interfere with their feeding, breeding, and other behaviours.The national park has tasked the Nepal Army and local youth groups with monitoring the ban, a development chopper operators see as a serious security concern.“The noise generated by choppers is alarming,” said Jagat Prasad Bhusal, chief administrative officer of the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality. “Every day, it feels like the loud noise will blow your ears out.”On November 13, the rural municipality held a discussion inviting ten lawmakers from the upper house of parliament in the Khumbu region. The programme had to be abandoned due to excessive noise of choppers. “Most complaints are from schools. The noise has affected the studies of children.”Every day, the rural municipality receives hordes of complaints from locals about noise pollution. “We do not oppose flights, but the helicopter companies are adamant about not obeying rules. They land anywhere they wish,” said Bhusal. According to the rural municipality, most helicopters are yet to pay the Rs200,000 annual “business tax” imposed by the local government. The park, which covers an area of 1,148 square kilometres in the Solukhumbu district, was established on July 19, 1976. In 1979, in recognition of its superlative natural surroundings and unique culture, it was put on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list.The national park said noise pollution in the wildlife habitat has resulted in behavioural changes in animals.The sounds can cause wild animals to leave their habitats and run into the villages. The park authority said accidents involving animals like Himalayan tahr and Himalayan goral, a goat-antelope with a short tail and backwards-pointing horns, are rising. The shy natural goral is found foraging and sheltering on rocky faces of mountains.The animals jump off the cliffs in shock when choppers fly at low altitudes with big sounds. Their deaths are rising. The park authority said they had done justice to the wild animals by stopping commercial flights above the national park.Tourism ministry officials said they are aware of the issue. “We have been discussing the matter with the forest ministry,” said Ram Krishna Lamichhane, spokesperson for the tourism ministry. “We hope the issue will be sorted out soon.”The tourism fraternity warned that the Everest sightseeing ban could harm Nepal’s tourism, which is still struggling to recover to pre-Covid levels. The park is also a major tourist attraction, especially for trekking to the Everest base camp.The Everest sightseeing tour, which falls into an expensive, high-end tourism segment, is a lifelong dream of many people around the world. ","summary":"The issue of banning helicopter sightseeing tours in one of the world’s most iconic natural regions, home to the planet’s tallest mountain, from January 1, has turned nasty.As state bodies at all levels, including the local government, are staking their unflinching claim to the skies over the Everest region, serious questions have been raised about Nepal’s high-end tourism prospects. Experts say such a jurisdiction issue may spill over to other national parks if this issue is not handled well. The federal government, however, has not taken the matter seriously.On December 12, the Sagarmatha National Park, which houses the world’s tallest peak, issued directives restricting commercial choppers from flying over it. On December 13, the civil aviation regulator responded that the park has no legal ground to enforce such a ban.After three days, on Monday, the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, the local federal unit, issued a strongly worded statement against commercial chopper operations in the Everest region.“We request the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal and all travel agencies operating within this rural municipality to refrain from booking or selling any packages that include helicopter flights for the Khumbu region,” according to the statement. “If any individual or agency engages in such activities after this notice, and if it causes any obstacles or issues in this region, the rural municipality will not be held accountable. This press release has been issued to inform all concerned parties.”The municipality added: “Beyond Lukla, only rescue and sling flights that comply with the laws and regulations of Sagarmatha National Park will be allowed. All other commercial helicopter flights will be banned entirely from January 1.”As per the rural municipality directive, a recommendation must be obtained from the health institution at the flight site for emergency rescues. A health professional must be present on the flight. If further treatment outside the region is required, patients must undergo a test at Pasanglhamu Nicole Niquille Hospital in Lukla and get a mandatory recommendation from the hospital. “Henceforth, only rescue and sling flights in compliance with the laws and regulations of Sagarmatha National Park will be permitted beyond Lukla,” the municipal statement reads.The statement comes in response to one by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, which vowed not to follow the rules imposed by the national park and asked the helicopter companies to continue with their regular flights. The immediate concern raised by the park is severe noise pollution caused by frequent helicopter flights over the area. The noise disturbs animals, which rely on the park’s relatively undisturbed natural environment. Excess noise can interfere with their feeding, breeding, and other behaviours.The national park has tasked the Nepal Army and local youth groups with monitoring the ban, a development chopper operators see as a serious security concern.“The noise generated by choppers is alarming,” said Jagat Prasad Bhusal, chief administrative officer of the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality. “Every day, it feels like the loud noise will blow your ears out.”On November 13, the rural municipality held a discussion inviting ten lawmakers from the upper house of parliament in the Khumbu region.

In this period of inaction from the court, Samara (who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) fell into depression and attempted suicide, feeling trapped and hopeless. “There is late justice, and these victims are still being victimised,” Samara’s legal counsel told the Post. “Justice delayed is justice denied.” Women in Nepal seeking justice for domestic violence or property partition wait years—often more than five and sometimes upwards of ten years—for the court to resolve their cases and fully implement the decision. The delays in case processing come at a cost to the women, who endure more harassment, financial strain, and loss of contact with their children as they wait for the justice system to take action. In the past year, the court has established a family bench in six of the 77 district courts in Nepal to hear women’s cases more quickly. The bench aims to give female plaintiffs faster decisions in cases related to family relations, alimony, domestic violence, and property division. The family bench, however, does not see a woman’s case when it also includes a legal matter outside of the purview of the bench, nor does the court see divorce cases as Nepali law mandates a one-year waiting period for divorce cases when one of the parties does not agree to the divorce. Since its filing, the main trial court has heard Samara’s case as it is tied to a property division case in which her late husband’s relative is the plaintiff. Samara’s interim order from the court has brought her some peace. Since the order two years ago, her harasser has stopped coming to her workplace demanding the property holdings of her late husband. “After she got the interim order, she believed in herself more,” Samara’s legal counsel said. “Before, she didn’t believe in court, she thought she would not get justice.” Samara’s legal counsel anticipates that the case will take at least another two and a half years at the district court, and may continue longer at the Supreme Court level if one of the parties chooses to appeal the decision. “She doesn’t feel protected,” the legal counsel said. Even when a woman’s case goes to the family bench, procedural hurdles can still delay the verdict, particularly when the case involves property division. Edha’s (who the Post is also identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) domestic violence and property division case is in its fourth year at the Kathmandu District Court. One of her hearings was with one of the three judges appointed to preside over the family bench. She had an arranged marriage more than 20 years ago, and soon after she gave birth to her first child. “After I got married, the abuse was non-stop,” she said. “It was quite brutal.”During her marriage, her husband, who continuously had relationships with other women, left her with serious injuries in bouts of violence, and pressured her to abort multiple pregnancies, though she did later have a second child as the pregnancy was too advanced to abort. Edha didn’t tell anyone about the abuse for most of her marriage. “If you’re going through something bad, if nobody comes to know, then it’s okay,” she said. “My fear was, if people find out, what will they think?”This fear of judgment stopped Edha from taking legal action for years. “In Nepal, if your husband hits you, that means it’s your fault,” she said. “With that kind of stigma, at times, I would just blame myself.” During the pandemic, Edha’s husband told her he wanted a divorce, and became more physically abusive. She decided to leave the house and move to a different home, though she felt hesitant about having to leave her children. “When he told me to get out of the house, and when he started hitting me, I thought I cannot survive in the house,” she said. “It was really difficult for me to leave. I feared I wouldn’t be able to take care of my children.”Edha hopes she will soon have her final hearing, which has been delayed because the court required further documentation. Edha fears seeing her abuser again at the hearing. “That fear is still within me,” she said. “I don’t want to look at that man.”After years of living alone, Edha feels most devastated by the loss of time with her children. She hopes her case will result in her being able to stay where she currently lives and have parental visitation rights. “They told me, within three months, this will be over,” she said between tears. “But it’s the fourth year running, and my kids are far away. I have missed the moments with them.” Edha feels stuck, with no other option than waiting for justice. “I don’t have any faith in the justice system of Nepal—no faith at all,” she said. According to domestic violence victims and their lawyers, when a male defendant has connections to judges or enough money to offer bribes, getting justice can be near impossible. Manika Khadka is a criminal lawyer working with the Women’s Foundation Nepal, and has seen dozens of women’s cases. “In some cases, he [the defendant] is so powerful and they use unnecessary power—that’s why we cannot get justice.”Neesa (also a pseudonym) filed a property division case against her husband nearly a decade ago and shortly after a domestic violence case. Male members of her family had for years violently abused her. Her cases have faced continuous delays, she claims, because of her husband’s bribes and connections to court officials. “You can go and register your case in the court, but then if corruption is involved… court procedures can be manipulated to cause delays,” she said. The Supreme Court has already issued a verdict in Neesa’s favor on the domestic violence case, ordering the defendant to pay both interim relief and a fine. The court, however, has failed to implement the decision.According to Neesa, because of bribes from her husband, officials in the implementation division of the district court have intentionally not enforced the Supreme Court’s verdict to make the defendant pay interim relief to the victim. Instead, the implementation division gave an order that would allow the defendant to avoid payment—a direct violation of the Supreme Court’s ruling. Neesa has no choice but to go back through the court system again, asking for the Supreme Court’s decision to be enforced. Her property case is still ongoing, and each step of the process takes months, she said. “There is a delay at every step of the process,” Neesa said. “The court officials don’t do their jobs efficiently.” Neesa feels frustrated with how long her cases have taken, and the amount of time, money and energy they have required from her. “It is a nightmare,” she said. “These delays and obstacles are attempts to make the plaintiff give up—women rarely have the resources to fight these cases for years and years.” “I can’t plan my life, I’m stuck,” she said. “It’s years of my life I won’t get back.” Samara, Edha, and Neesa each are equipped with legal counsel and have current cases pending, but, as Neesa reflected, innumerable women endure abuse in silence, particularly after they see other women endure long delays in the court cases. “I am educated and can stand up for myself and this is how I am treated, imagine the women who are uneducated,” Neesa said. “If [the court procedure] was simple and it was fair a lot more women would go through it and get justice,” she said.   ","summary":"Samara endured six months of harassment from a relative of her late husband before a court interim order demanded her harasser leave her alone.

Now I have started meeting top leaders of the Madhesh-based political parties,” Tripathi told the Post. His team has urged the leaders to create a “loose alliance” at first and to transform it later into a united front for the “larger cause of the Madhesh and the Madheshi people”.Tripathi has formed a three-member task force to hold talks with leaders from various Madhesh-based political parties and he himself is holding talks with the top brass.“Most of those who I or our friends have spoken to are positive towards forming such an alliance at the beginning,” Tripathi said. “As the country is confronting several problems and crises, the time has come for us to unite and work together.”After the second people’s movement in 2006, politics in Madhesh got a new lease of life with the rise of regional political forces. New political parties and fronts were formed, raising several issues related to the Madheshi people and their under-representation in state organs.Some of the prominent Madhesh-based parties got unified and emerged as decisive forces in national politics. But they could not sustain their unity.Within a couple of years, the Madhesh-based parties split into several parties. They, however, remained united on their agendas until the promulgation of the new constitution in 2015.Stating that the major political parties didn’t address some of their important demands while writing the new constitution, they led a strong agitation dubbed Madhesh uprising, and they even protested on the Nepal-India border blocking the movement of goods from India.Dozens of people were killed during the uprising but their agendas remained unsettled and the country went into the local, provincial and federal elections.The Madhesh-based political parties from the southern belt of the country with a huge vote share in the national politics could not retain power due to divisions among them.Tripathi hopes that they will now “learn from the past and aim to revive the old glory of Madheshi parties and address the country’s crises”. Tripathi hopes this mission can bring them together and will make them agree on some crucial issues.So far, he has met Upendra Yadav, chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal); CK Raut, chairman of the Janamat Party; Ashok Rai, chairman of Janata Samajbadi Party; Resham Chaudhary, chairman of the Nagarik Unmukti Party; and Prabhu Sah, chair of Aam Janata Party. Some of the task force members have met with Mahantha Thakur, too. Tripathi also plans to meet Rajendra Mahato, who recently formed a new party, Rastriya Mukti Kranti Nepal.“I have found that no one is against this proposal,” Tripathi said. “Once forming the loose alliance, we will agree on some common agendas and will collaborate on those in the future. But that does not mean that we will come together to form a new party immediately.”After talking with all top leaders of the Madhesh-based parties, the Tripathi-led team now plans to hold a joint meeting with them. The meeting will discuss the possible agenda and the issues in which they can work together.This initiative, however, hasn’t made everyone optimistic.“Madheshi parties are divided horizontally and vertically and have split into so many parties, groups and factions,” a senior leader of a Madhesh-based party told the Post. “There are very few chances that they will come together.”Though Tripathi has started a new campaign, some experts and observers doubt all Madhesh based parties will come together.“The ground in Madhesh is not the same as it was ten years ago,” said Dipendra Jha, a longtime observer of Madheshi politics and former chief attorney of Madhesh Province. “The situation is unpredictable as new youths are emerging and the ground is fast shifting.”Unlike Yadav’s JSP-Nepal, no party holds a stronghold in the Madhesh, said Jha.Another Madheshi leader, however, said that small parties led by Tripathi, Raut, Chaudhary, Sah and the Rastriya Mukti Kranti Nepal are likely to come together, if not those led by Upendra Yadav and Mahatha Thakur.Tripathi plans to hold a joint meeting of chiefs of all the big and small Madhesh-based parties within a week.A leader said the initiative will at least bring them together and engage them in some brainstorming.The senior leader pointed out a slew of reasons why unity among Madhesh-based parties is easier said than done.“Due to a lack of common ideology and principles, tendency of not accepting each other’s existence, personality clashes, vendettas, local dynamics and possible power-sharing deals, the parties might find it hard to come together,” the leader said.

His team has urged the leaders to create a “loose alliance” at first and to transform it later into a united front for the “larger cause of the Madhesh and the Madheshi people”.Tripathi has formed a three-member task force to hold talks with leaders from various Madhesh-based political parties and he himself is holding talks with the top brass.“Most of those who I or our friends have spoken to are positive towards forming such an alliance at the beginning,” Tripathi said. “As the country is confronting several problems and crises, the time has come for us to unite and work together.”After the second people’s movement in 2006, politics in Madhesh got a new lease of life with the rise of regional political forces. New political parties and fronts were formed, raising several issues related to the Madheshi people and their under-representation in state organs.Some of the prominent Madhesh-based parties got unified and emerged as decisive forces in national politics. But they could not sustain their unity.Within a couple of years, the Madhesh-based parties split into several parties. They, however, remained united on their agendas until the promulgation of the new constitution in 2015.Stating that the major political parties didn’t address some of their important demands while writing the new constitution, they led a strong agitation dubbed Madhesh uprising, and they even protested on the Nepal-India border blocking the movement of goods from India.Dozens of people were killed during the uprising but their agendas remained unsettled and the country went into the local, provincial and federal elections.The Madhesh-based political parties from the southern belt of the country with a huge vote share in the national politics could not retain power due to divisions among them.Tripathi hopes that they will now “learn from the past and aim to revive the old glory of Madheshi parties and address the country’s crises”. Tripathi hopes this mission can bring them together and will make them agree on some crucial issues.So far, he has met Upendra Yadav, chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal); CK Raut, chairman of the Janamat Party; Ashok Rai, chairman of Janata Samajbadi Party; Resham Chaudhary, chairman of the Nagarik Unmukti Party; and Prabhu Sah, chair of Aam Janata Party. Some of the task force members have met with Mahantha Thakur, too. Tripathi also plans to meet Rajendra Mahato, who recently formed a new party, Rastriya Mukti Kranti Nepal.“I have found that no one is against this proposal,” Tripathi said. “Once forming the loose alliance, we will agree on some common agendas and will collaborate on those in the future. But that does not mean that we will come together to form a new party immediately.”After talking with all top leaders of the Madhesh-based parties, the Tripathi-led team now plans to hold a joint meeting with them. The meeting will discuss the possible agenda and the issues in which they can work together.This initiative, however, hasn’t made everyone optimistic.“Madheshi parties are divided horizontally and vertically and have split into so many parties, groups and factions,” a senior leader of a Madhesh-based party told the Post. “There are very few chances that they will come together.”Though Tripathi has started a new campaign, some experts and observers doubt all Madhesh based parties will come together.“The ground in Madhesh is not the same as it was ten years ago,” said Dipendra Jha, a longtime observer of Madheshi politics and former chief attorney of Madhesh Province. “The situation is unpredictable as new youths are emerging and the ground is fast shifting.”Unlike Yadav’s JSP-Nepal, no party holds a stronghold in the Madhesh, said Jha.Another Madheshi leader, however, said that small parties led by Tripathi, Raut, Chaudhary, Sah and the Rastriya Mukti Kranti Nepal are likely to come together, if not those led by Upendra Yadav and Mahatha Thakur.Tripathi plans to hold a joint meeting of chiefs of all the big and small Madhesh-based parties within a week.A leader said the initiative will at least bring them together and engage them in some brainstorming.The senior leader pointed out a slew of reasons why unity among Madhesh-based parties is easier said than done.“Due to a lack of common ideology and principles, tendency of not accepting each other’s existence, personality clashes, vendettas, local dynamics and possible power-sharing deals, the parties might find it hard to come together,” the leader said.

According to Ghimire, Congress believes that political party’s unions should not be allowed to function in the bureaucracy.He was speaking on the bill to regulate the formation, operation, and conditions of federal civil service at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee meeting on Thursday.Ghimire said those on the government payroll should not participate in trade union's activities.“In civil service, trade unions shouldn't be formed based on their party allegiance,” Ghimire said. “If a trade union is needed, there could be an official one where every civil servant can be a member.”The restoration of multi-party democracy in Nepal in 1990 opened the space for civil society organisations, including trade unions. The registration of trade unions started in 1993.Devraj Dahal, a researcher who has extensively studied the necessity of establishing trade unions in Nepal, says that at that time, labourers around Nepal were getting the short end of the stick, which is one reason why trade unions were established in Nepal. Trade unions, or labour unions, are formed to advocate the rights of labourers and improve their working conditions.“Trade unions are needed to create a just society, but in Nepal, those unions have been working as proxy agencies of political parties, to advance their vested interests,” Dahal said. “Hence, their relevance can be questioned.”Dahal added that trade unions are concentrated in Kathmandu and they have failed to work in the interest of labourers outside cities who might be in most need of their advocacy.Congress lawmaker Ghimire told the Post that when every party has its trade union in the civil service or any other institutional organisations, they may support respective party’s sister wings but will not benefit the larger society.“It is high time that the country dissolved trade unions affiliated to political parties and marched ahead for the development of the country,” Ghimire said.Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) whip Bina Lama shared a more radical view at the same meeting. She said that trade unions should be completely abolished in the civil service to help bureaucracy function effectively.“Trade unions have become parties’ recruitment centres in the bureaucracy,” Lama said. “To prevent it from being expanded further, the law should prevent civil servants from joining political parties or their sister organisations.”However, Dahal differed. “Nepal is a signatory to many international treaties, which oblige us to do so. Therefore, the country cannot fully eradicate trade unions,” he said. Instead of making it a recruitment centre for political parties, as the Congress chief whip Ghimire said, Dahal advocates an umbrella trade union where all can be adjusted.“In most Western countries, including Germany, there is one official trade union that works efficiently,” Dahal added.The draft of the Federal Civil Service Act, sent by the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration for discussion in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the Parliament, also proposes approval of one official trade union for government employees at the federal and provincial levels.While speaking on the bill in the same meeting, Mahesh Bartaula, the chief whip of ruling party CPN-UML, stood in favour of fixing the term of reservation quota for a single person in the civil service. It means a single person should be allowed to get a government position under reservation quota for a single opportunity and then the person should compete under open category for other positions.“How long will we give the facility of reservation repeatedly for a single person? It is wrong to provide reservation to the same person in every post within the service,” Bartaula further said. “Reservation should be allowed for a person only once and it should be on the basis of class.”Bartaula also advocated for the two year cooling period for government officials while joining national and international organisations after their retirement.

Students actively take part in and enjoy such events as they get a break from their regular curricular activities.A few days ago, a college student lost her life during one such event on the outskirts of Kathmandu.Family members and relatives of the deceased have accused the college management of negligence while officials from the educational institution say that they couldn’t avert the tragedy despite doing everything possible to save her. Police have been investigating the case.“The negligence of Xavier International College, Boudha Tusal ended the life of my 19-year-old niece, Gungun Tamang,” Bina Theeng Tamang, a poet and writer, wrote on Facebook on December 25.On December 23, Xavier International College took 63 students pursuing Bachelor’s degrees to Scout Hill in Kakani, over 15 kilometres northwest of Balaju, for orientation. That night, they had a campfire, and Gungun Tamang, a Bachelor of Business Studies (BBS) student, suddenly fainted while enjoying the company of her friends.“The college had signed the consent letter to the parents about the orientation programme, but they did not do a timely rescue to save the life of my niece,” Tamang said. Gungun had no health issues before that, according to Tamang.A Xavier International student who participated in the outing also accused the teachers of not promptly rushing her to the hospital. After Gungun fainted, the teachers took her to a room, made her sleep, and left her in the presence of her friend, the student said. Then, they rejoined the campfire.A few students pursuing a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree said the teacher did not consider cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but some students did. “Only after one of our friends made a video call to his home and consulted with a family member, who is a medical person, were we suggested to take Gungun immediately to the hospital, as her condition was critical,” one of the students told the Post on the condition of anonymity.“Only after we conveyed this to our teachers did they show concern.”According to the students, the college did not have its vehicle there, so the teachers first tried to find a vehicle to rescue her, but it took time to do so.An Armed Police Force United Nations Peacekeeping Training School is near Scout Hill in Kakani. The school staff initially thought about taking Gungun there on a motorbike. However, another student who had participated in the orientation programme said that since Gungun was unconscious, it was not possible for her to ride pillion.The teachers managed a vehicle from the Armed Police Force and two medical personnel of the Police team to take Gungun to Green City Hospital in Samakhushi. According to hospital records obtained by the Post, by the time she was brought to the hospital, it was 10:40 at night. The hospital declared the patient ‘brought dead’. Though she fainted around 8:30 in the evening, the college staff didn’t rescue her immediately, the students allege.She could have probably been saved had the teachers shown immediate concern and made necessary arrangements promptly, the students the Post spoke to said.A student said the college had around 10 staff members for the outing, including teachers and other supporting staff.According to Gungun’s postmortem report, she didn’t suffer a stroke or a heart attack, and the report claims it was a natural death. However, the family members decry the college’s negligence.“She must have fainted due to the fluctuating temperature, and we also learned that while burning a fire, the college staff had used turpentine oil, which is injurious to health,” Tamang said. “My niece died at such a young age for a lack of timely treatment.”However, college coordinator Rajesh Nepal denies using turpentine oil to burn fire. He, however, acknowledges burning plastics. “We had used plastics to light the firewood,” Nepal said.Burning turpentine oil or plastic is injurious to health, says Binjawala Shrestha, a public health expert. “However, in Gungun’s case, I cannot give my definite opinion without studying the case in detail,” Shrestha says.On December 26, Gungun’s family members filed a case against the college with the Crime Investigation Department (CID) of the Nepal Police.College officials have denied the allegations. Nepal, the college coordinator, said it is natural for family members to blame the college staff for their loss. “We understand they are in pain,” Nepal said. “However, we as college staff did all we could to save her life… Within 2-3 hours of the incident, we brought her to the hospital. I had come with the police medical team to the hospital, bringing Gungun. It took us some time to make full arrangements since the college did not have its vehicle on standby.”Nepal Police Spokesperson Bishwa Adhikari says that death cases of students while on education tours are reported often. However, the number is not that big, he said.For people working in the education sector, taking students on a field trip for educational purposes is not conceptually wrong. However, educational institutions should obtain parental consent before doing so, they say. Parents and educational institutions should also share the students' health histories, but there is a lack of such practices, according to them.“Parents should send their children to such programmes only after confirming that the safety measures are properly followed,” said Medini Lamichhane, an education expert. “And educational institutions along with parents should be aware of the students’ health history so they can properly take care of them in case of emergency.”Lamichhane added that the education sector in the country lacks proper regulations on this issue, and it is high time a policy is formulated.

Businesses are concerned that these delays will damage the tourism industry.","summary":"In Bhairahawa, an international airport has been built to attract tourists, but jets hardly land here. Hotel entrepreneurs to groceries all hoped for a business boom, which didn’t happen.The number of tourists, though small, who come via the surface route has kept business running to some extent.But they, too, face hassles.On November 3, Nepal’s immigration office at Belahiya, Rupandehi, made around 800 tourists wait 7 to 8 hours for visas. The main door and a few windows of the immigration office broke due to an uncontrolled crowd. Officials said the problem was temporary and would soon be sorted.But still, tourists have to wait for at least 4 to 5 hours to obtain visas. Tour guides, bus and taxi drivers, tourists and hotels have started expressing anger at the service full of hassles.Narayan Prasad Pandey, chief of the Immigration Office, Belahiya, said they are short on manpower. This has resulted in delayed processing of visa services.“When many tourists come at once, a problem like this occurs. Only five officers, including the chief, handle visa processing. Officials here are compelled to work for 14 hours a day.”Lumbini, the birthplace of the Buddha, has been a World Heritage Site since 1997. This has been a big draw for tourists for decades.Most of the Indian visitors come for casino purposes.Lumbini represents an outstanding universal value regarding religious importance, culture, spirituality and archaeology. “Tourists coming to Nepal via Sunauli or Belahiya border point is growing, but our manpower strength has not increased,” said Pandey.Pandey said that sometimes more than 1,500 tourists arrive in a day. The service is available from four desks. It takes around a minute to provide a visa to a tourist with all the required documents and half an hour for departure clearance.“If three additional officers are appointed, this problem would be solved immediately. We have been requesting to appoint officers repeatedly to the immigration department,” said Pandey.Regarding tourist arrival, the immigration Office in Belahiya is the second largest gateway after Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu.Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the arrival of tourists through the Sunauli border point was 161,396 annually. The number dropped to zero during the Covid and gradually increased from 2022.According to the immigration office, more than 83,000 tourists from third countries came to Nepal through the Sunali border point till November this year. The number of departures is 82,000.The tourism ministry, Nepal Tourism Board and other government agencies also do national campaigns to promote tourism and draw visitors. However, spending millions on campaigns and programmes failed to address the problem of immigration at Belahiya.While the three-tier government adheres to the policy to increase the arrival of tourists, tourism entrepreneurs worry about the problems faced by tourists at the immigration.“Tourists who order dinner at 6 pm go to sleep on empty stomachs due to delays caused by the immigration office,” said Aasha Gurung, director of Hotel Landmark, located 1.5 km from the immigration office. “As tourists wait for hours, we have started providing refreshments in the queue,” Gurung said.Tour operators normally allocate an hour for the immigration process, but in Nepal, the delay in immigration makes them wait for 5 to 6 hours.Most of them who wish to visit Tilaurakot in Kapilvastu, Ramgram of Nawalparasi and Devdaha, all related to Buddhism, must cancel at least one pilgrimage tour to manage time.Most of these pilgrims avoid eating meals after sunset, according to hoteliers.“Starting September, 75 percent of hotels were booked by Buddhist pilgrims. Tourists have made advanced bookings for the coming month,” said Gurung.“The problems faced by tourists on the border have sent a negative message. No one has paid attention to easing the immigration process,” said Sagar Adhikari, former president of Nepal Tour and Travels Association in Lumbini Province.  "},{"hash":"90b80be9b727902cb52459c1fd8f8f9e1eceadc7527adf27e3d45b8e435c6966","title":"government-introduces-policy-to-boost-mcses","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/12/28/government-introduces-policy-to-boost-mcses","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/money/money-1735350513.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1735344000000,"source":"kp","category":"money","content":"**Summary of Micro, Cottage, and Small Industry (MCSE)**\n\n* MCSEs are important for Nepal's economy, creating jobs and boosting income.\n* The government has created a new policy to help MCSEs grow and contribute more to the economy.\n* The policy focuses on supporting entrepreneurs, improving education, and linking MCSEs to larger industries.\n* Challenges for MCSEs include high costs, lack of skilled workers, and limited access to finance.\n* The policy aims to address these challenges by simplifying registration, providing training, and subsidizing loans.\n* The policy also seeks to increase exports of MCSE products and support traditional handicrafts.\n* Effective implementation of the policy is important for MCSEs to succeed.","summary":"To enhance the economy, the government has implemented a policy to promote micro, cottage, and small industries (MCSEs) by creating an entrepreneur-friendly environment, connecting them to value chains, and strengthening their infrastructure, while addressing challenges such as informal employment, lack of financing, and weak coordination."},{"hash":"a48b8d7a460768d0e6f711f0610aa51acfabbdb70812bd268617405bfa73cb62","title":"burn-victims-forced-to-foot-costly-medical-bills-despite-free-care-pledge","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/health/2024/12/30/burn-victims-forced-to-foot-costly-medical-bills-despite-free-care-pledge","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/thumb5-1735521549.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1735516800000,"source":"kp","category":"health","content":"Urmila Devi Jha, a burn victim from Hariwan, Sarlahi district, has been admitted to Kirtipur Hospital for treatment of burn injuries.The 45-year-old, burnt while she was sitting by fire some two weeks ago, was brought to the hospital only on Friday.Her family took her to a local hospital in Birgunj and spent around Rs200,000 before they brought her to Kathmandu as they did not have money for further treatment.“We spent all our money on the patient’s treatment,” said Dinanath Jha, the patient’s son-in-law. “We cannot afford to pay for further treatment.”Doctors say around 35 percent of Jha’s body parts—including back, leg, and hands—have been badly burnt and delay in bringing her to hospital has further complicated the matter.Nepal is among the countries with the highest incidence of burn injuries. It is the second most common injury in rural Nepal, accounting for 5 percent of disabilities, according to the World Health Organisation.In October, the government decided to provide free treatment to impoverished burn victims. However, even two months after the declaration, the free scheme has not been implemented in any hospital. Poor burn victims and their relatives are forced to pay their medical bills.“The work procedure sent to us by the government is not specific, as it does not say anything about who would get free treatment, what would be the process of reimbursement, and budget arrangements, among other things,” said Dr Kiran Nakarmi, director at Kirtipur Hospital.“We do not deprive patients of treatment just because they cannot afford to pay medical bills. But many patients would easily get free treatment if the work procedure had been detailed.”Had the government decision been implemented on time, poor burn victims like Jha seeking care at Kirtipur Hospital and other state-run health facilities including Bir Hospital of Bagmati Province, BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences of Koshi Province, Narayani Hospital in Madhesh Province and Pokhara Institute of Health Sciences of Gandaki Province would not have been forced to foot their costly medical bills.Likewise, patients would also get free treatment at Bheri Hospital of Lumbini Province, Surkhet Provincial Hospital of Karnali Province and Seti Provincial Hospital of Sudurpaschim Province.Minister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel has been announcing one free scheme after another but is seemingly unbothered about their implementation. The Post’s attempts to contact Minister Paudel could not succeed.“We heard of the free scheme for burn victims from the media but we are yet to get any instruction or the budget to implement it,” said Dr Peeyush Dahal, chief of the Burns and Plastic Surgery Unit at Bir Hospital. “Many burn victims can’t afford to pay medical bills even if Bir hospital does not charge much for treatment.”Meanwhile, the number of burn incidents has risen nationwide, amid declining temperatures. As people make bonfires to stay warm, the number of burn cases has increased alarmingly, according to the Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre in Kirtipur [Kirtipur Hospital].“In the summer, we have around 20 burn patients a day, but the number rises to double that and even more in the winter months,” Nakarmi said. “We have 37 patients today [Sunday], and five of them were brought on Saturday night. Most of the victims were burnt while sitting by the fire.”Elderly women and under-age children are more vulnerable to fire incidents, as they remain in the house or near fireplaces most of the time. They have a weaker immune system than adults, and that makes the recovery process more complicated for them, according to doctors.Every winter, the hospital converts other general wards to burn units due to a massive influx of burn victims.Doctors say awareness alone can substantially increase the burn patients’ chances of survival. “Don’t leave small children and elderly people close to the fire,” said Nakarmi. “Risk of women getting injured in fire is high, as the sari they wear can catch fire quickly.”Experts suggest not letting children play near fire. Turning one’s back to fire and burning logs while sleeping at night is also dangerous, according to them.Burn patients need enough intravenous fluids, around eight litres in 24 hours. But fulfilling this intake criteria is often not possible while transporting patients from one facility to another, which reduces their chances of survival.The Ministry of Health and Population estimates that each year 55,000 people throughout the country suffer burn injuries.One past study shows that over 40,000 people sustain burn injuries (minor or severe) in Nepal every year.

So far, three clades of mpox viruses—clade I, clade IIa and cladeIIb—have been identified.Officials say clade identification tells the virus’s virulence and transmissibility of the virus, which is necessary to curb the further spread of deadly disease. As the country lacks a system to carry out virus sub-typing, it sought help from the UN health body. “We will probably send the specimen taken directly from the rash—skin fluid or crusts collected from the infected person—to the World Health Organisation’s collaborating centre in Thailand for clade identification,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Identification of the virus’ clade will help us to figure out what extra measures are needed to mitigate the risks of further spread.”Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with the mpox virus. Last week, Nepal confirmed its second mpox case. A 36-year-old man from Tanahun, who returned from Saudi Arabia on December 19, tested positive for the disease. The country confirmed its first case of mpox infection in June last year when a 60-year-old foreign national tested positive.Experts say clade I, which is present in the Congo basin, causes up to 10 percent human mortality and is transmitted by rodents, although human-to-human transmission has also been recorded. Clade IIa, which exists in West Africa, has a low mortality rate, but clade IIb is currently spreading globally through human transmission. Clade IIb was responsible for infection in the first mpox case in Nepal.According to Ojha, the health condition of the infected person is normal, and he could be discharged from the hospital in a few days.With the confirmation of the second mpox case in Nepal, health authorities have stepped up surveillance measures to prevent a possible outbreak of the deadly viral disease.Along with stepping up screening of passengers entering the country via the Tribhuvan International Airport, health authorities have requested dermatologists throughout the country to refer suspected cases for testing.“We have also deployed health workers at the health desk at Pokhara International Airport and screened passengers who arrived from China for the dragon boat festival,” said Ojha. “We also conducted an orientation for health workers serving in strategic locations.”Public health experts in Nepal say that screening suspects at health desks at international airports and land crossings is not sufficient to prevent outbreaks, as the first symptoms of mpox can take between five and 21 days for the first symptoms of mpox to appear, and not all cases can be detected at health desks.Monkeypox cases have been reported in neighbouring India, with which Nepal shares a long, porous border. India has recorded at least 30 mpox infections since 2022.Health experts say that even though mpox is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the risks should not be underestimated. They stress the importance of precautions, saying that any disease seen in any corner of the world can reach Nepal due to the high mobility of people.Mpox has been a neglected public health problem in parts of Africa for decades. The disease came to widespread attention after May 2022, when countries outside Africa began reporting new cases.Since then, mpox has spread globally. More than 100,000 people from 122 countries have already tested positive for the disease.Its symptoms include fever, headache, swelling, body aches, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to prevent transmission. ","summary":"In a bid to determine the clade of the mpox (monkeypox) virus, the Ministry of Health and Population is preparing to send specimens from infected persons to the World Health Organisation’s collaborating centre in Thailand.A clade is a subtype, genotype or group of viruses that originates from a common ancestor. So far, three clades of mpox viruses—clade I, clade IIa and cladeIIb—have been identified.Officials say clade identification tells the virus’s virulence and transmissibility of the virus, which is necessary to curb the further spread of deadly disease. As the country lacks a system to carry out virus sub-typing, it sought help from the UN health body. “We will probably send the specimen taken directly from the rash—skin fluid or crusts collected from the infected person—to the World Health Organisation’s collaborating centre in Thailand for clade identification,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Identification of the virus’ clade will help us to figure out what extra measures are needed to mitigate the risks of further spread.”Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with the mpox virus. Last week, Nepal confirmed its second mpox case. A 36-year-old man from Tanahun, who returned from Saudi Arabia on December 19, tested positive for the disease. The country confirmed its first case of mpox infection in June last year when a 60-year-old foreign national tested positive.Experts say clade I, which is present in the Congo basin, causes up to 10 percent human mortality and is transmitted by rodents, although human-to-human transmission has also been recorded. Clade IIa, which exists in West Africa, has a low mortality rate, but clade IIb is currently spreading globally through human transmission. Clade IIb was responsible for infection in the first mpox case in Nepal.According to Ojha, the health condition of the infected person is normal, and he could be discharged from the hospital in a few days.With the confirmation of the second mpox case in Nepal, health authorities have stepped up surveillance measures to prevent a possible outbreak of the deadly viral disease.Along with stepping up screening of passengers entering the country via the Tribhuvan International Airport, health authorities have requested dermatologists throughout the country to refer suspected cases for testing.“We have also deployed health workers at the health desk at Pokhara International Airport and screened passengers who arrived from China for the dragon boat festival,” said Ojha. “We also conducted an orientation for health workers serving in strategic locations.”Public health experts in Nepal say that screening suspects at health desks at international airports and land crossings is not sufficient to prevent outbreaks, as the first symptoms of mpox can take between five and 21 days for the first symptoms of mpox to appear, and not all cases can be detected at health desks.Monkeypox cases have been reported in neighbouring India, with which Nepal shares a long, porous border.

The number could be even higher, as not all the children of the age group have been screened.“The number of the diagnosed cases were reported by the health facilities, where ailing children were taken for treatment or reported by female community health volunteers,” said Angad Bahadur Shahi, chief of the Health Office, Banke. “A separate screening programme has been started, which will tell the exact scenario.”Malnutrition is considered a silent health crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five, which fell from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.However, the progress is not the same in all provinces. More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province [Banke district is part of Lumbini Province] suffer from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Child health experts say a sharp rise in moderately and severely acute malnutrition cases in Banke is alarming, which could hinder attempts to reduce malnutrition and overall hunger problems. The increase in the problems will also hinder the attempts to achieve the United Nations-backed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has set targets to meet those goals.The country needs to reduce stunting to 15 percent from the existing 25 percent by 2030 to meet the SDGs targets, wasting to 4 percent from the current eight percent and underweight to 10 percent from the existing 19 percent.Wasting or underweight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.“Severe acute malnutrition is a medical emergency, and such children need immediate hospital admission and treatment,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, a child health expert who is also the former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Detection of moderately acute malnutrition means the problems have started recently.” He said these indicators show that efforts to rein in existing malnutrition problems and end them permanently are insufficient.Malnutrition plays a major role in the under-five mortality rate. The problem also hinders children’s mental development and eventually affects the country’s economic health by weakening intellectual capacity, reducing productivity in adulthood, and increasing vulnerability to diseases, according to experts.Health authorities have taken various measures to address malnutrition problems, including distributing ready-to-use food and running nutrition rehab homes in 24 federal and provincial hospitals. Severely acute malnourished children get admitted and treated in those centres. Experts stressed addressing moderately acute malnutrition problems, which are likely to become severe if not treated timely.“Many people consider malnutrition only a health problem, but it is a multisectoral problem, which needs a multisectoral approach to deal with,” said Upreti. “Treating severely malnourished children does not stop the problems. We need to address the poverty of their families.”Experts said non-health interventions—awareness drives, improved financial conditions of people, their education levels, and sanitation conditions—could go a long way in improving health indicators, including nutrition status.“We have made a multisectoral nutrition plan to address the existing malnutrition problems,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Sincere efforts of all concerned stakeholders can address the existing problems.”Malnutrition affects the physical as well as mental growth of children, which ultimately affects the country’s economic health, according to experts.

In places where iodine is naturally rare, it needs to be artificially introduced into the diet via fortified food products.The Salt Trading Corporation, the agency responsible for importing and distributing salt in Nepal, fortifies iodine at 50 ppm (parts per million) per kilogram of salt, which is higher than the recommended dosage. The World Health Organisation, however, recommends iodine concentration at 15 to 40 ppm per kg. Only 40 ppm of iodine per kilogramme of salt is fortified for India, as it is assumed that the Indian population does not need as much iodine as the Nepali people, since they also get iodine content from foods produced near the ocean.Health experts in Nepal have blamed the excessive amounts of iodine content in salt for the rise in non-communicable diseases, including hypothyroidism.Several studies—including the 2016 Nepal National Micronutrient Status Survey jointly carried out by the World Health Organisation, UNICEF, the US-based Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Ministry of Health and Population—found that Nepalis consume excessive amounts of iodine, which has resulted in high prevalence of hyperthyroidism, a condition when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones.The survey showed that more than two-thirds—68 percent—of the population across the country is consuming iodine far in excess of the recommended levels.According to the Non-communicable Disease Risk Factors: Steps Survey-2019, 5.6 percent of the adults (6.5 percent of women and 4.6 percent of men) reported adding salt often or always to food right before or while eating.Additionally, 19.5 percent of the adults (18.1 percent of the women and 21.1 percent of men) reported consuming processed foods that are often or always high in salt.Doctors in Nepal suspect that the high iodine content in the salt being sold in Nepal could be among the reasons for the high prevalence of several non-communicable diseases, including thyroid disorders and hypertension.A change in dietary patterns and an increased consumption of processed foods (including packaged soups) have resulted in an increased prevalence of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, they added.Earlier, the government had sent a team of experts to salt factories in India’s Gujarat state to study the iodine fortification process and the possibility of lowering the iodine content in salt. The expert team furnished its report, but the concerned authorities could not decide on the reduction of iodine level in salt.“We have decided to wait further until the report of the planned survey comes,” said Thapa. “The report will help us analyse what changes have happened in the last 10 years and make appropriate decisions.”In 1993, Nepal mandated that salt be fortified with iodine to prevent health problems caused by iodine deficiency, as salt is both cheap and used round the year.Officials said the higher iodine level was mandated for Nepal under the assumption that transport and storage times were longer at the time as the salt had to be carried on the backs of men and animals and some amount of iodine would dissipate by the time the salt reached markets, mainly in the remote parts of the country.However, with roads reaching almost all corners of the country, transportation time has significantly decreased, so there is no need for such a high level of iodine in salt, say doctors.The World Health Organisation recommends less than two grams of sodium or five grams of salt per day for adults to reduce blood pressure, and cut the risks of cardiovascular diseases and stroke.

Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, ending with a layer of whipped cream on top.Garnish with additional berries and chopped nuts if desired.Refrigerate the trifle for at least 2 hours before serving to allow the flavours to meld together. Serve chilled, and enjoy the delicious layers of this custard trifle with brownie filling.Strawberry Bliss TartIngredients:For the Crust:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour1/4 cup granulated sugar1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 cup unsalted butter, cold and cut into small cubes1 large egg yolk2-3 tablespoons ice waterFor the Filling:1 1/2 cups milk1/2 cup granulated sugar3 large egg yolks1/4 cup cornstarch1 teaspoon vanilla extract2 tablespoons unsalted butterFor the Topping:1 1/2 pounds fresh strawberries, hulled and halved1/4 cup apricot jam1 tablespoon water Instructions:Prepare the CrustWhisk together the flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl.Add the cold butter cubes and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to blend the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.Whisk together the egg yolk and two tablespoons of ice water in a small bowl. Add this mixture to the flour and butter until the dough starts to come together. If needed, add another tablespoon of ice water.Form the dough into a disc, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.Bake the CrustPreheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface to fit a 9-inch tart pan. Press the dough into the pan and trim any excess.Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork and line it with parchment paper. Fill with pie weights or dried beans.Bake for 15 minutes, then remove the parchment paper and weights. Continue baking for another 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Let it cool completely.Make the Pastry CreamIn a medium saucepan, heat the milk until it just begins to simmer.Whisk together the sugar, egg yolks, and cornstarch in a separate bowl until smooth.Slowly pour the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisking constantly to prevent curdling.Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens and comes to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract and butter until smooth.Pour the pastry cream into a bowl, cover it with plastic wrap (pressing it directly onto the surface to prevent skin from forming), and refrigerate until chilled.Assemble the TartOnce the crust and pastry cream are completely cool, spread the pastry cream evenly in the tart shell.Arrange the strawberry halves on top of the pastry cream in a decorative pattern.Heat the apricot jam and water in a small saucepan until smooth and slightly thinned. Brush this glaze over the strawberries to give them a beautiful shine. Optionally, you can pipe some whipped cream stars on the edge of the tart.ServeRefrigerate the tart for at least 1 hour before serving to allow the flavours to meld.Slice and enjoy the delicious buttery crust, creamy filling, and fresh strawberries.White Rafaello Tres Leches CakeIngredients:For the Cake:1 cup all-purpose flour1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt5 large eggs, separated1 cup granulated sugar, divided1/3 cup whole milk1 teaspoon vanilla extractFor the Tres Leches Mixture:1 cup coconut milk1 cup evaporated milk1 cup sweetened condensed milk1/2 cup white chocolate, meltedFor the Topping:1 1/2 cups heavy cream1/4 cup powdered sugar1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract1/2 cup shredded coconut, toastedRafaello candies for garnish Instructions:Make the CakePreheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Out of nowhere, I messaged my friend Santona on a whim: ‘A trip to Rara’. With little hope, I awaited her reply, and I have no idea what I’d have done if she had denied it. However, just like the phrase “waiting for the nudge,” she enthusiastically agreed, and soon we roped in our friend, Nirjara.This wasn’t our first trip together—we’d ventured to Pokhara, tried bungee jumping, paragliding, and trekked trails like Khuma and Korchan since our first year of bachelor studies. My idea this time was a well-packaged tour, but plans changed, and new destinations were chosen. The pristine Tilicho Lake became our goal. Without overthinking, I agreed; after all, it’s Nepal and here, no matter where you decide to trek, you’ll experience heaven.From Kathmandu to Manang: Green Lake and apple delightsTravelling to Manang was a meditative experience in itself. As a scout exploring different parts of Nepal, I had often embraced the rush of adventure. But here, by the serene Green Lake under the sun's warm glow, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment: ‘We’ve finally made it—without getting lost and in the right place.’ We clicked photos, laughed, and even made some silly TikTok videos. The famous apple farms of Manang called out to us with their irresistible offer: a feast of apples for just Rs200. If you’re travelling here, catching the early bus ensures Manang’s charm unfolds entirely by the end of the day.Khangsar to Tilicho Base Camp: rocks and rantsAn early morning jeep ride brought us to Khangsar. The trek was said to take 5-6 hours, but once we started, I moved ahead of my friends, a habit I don’t quite understand. I wondered if my friends would make it before dark. To my relief, their laughter and chatter soon filled the air, joining me.Then we set off into the landslide area, with jagged rocks above hanging like wind chimes ready to fall. We promised not to look up and remained focused on the trail. The journey was filled with everyday conversations from patriarchy to childhood TV shows, and before we knew it, the night wrapped around us as we arrived at the base camp. After some confusion over our booking, we finally settled in, ate quickly, and fell asleep. One tip: keep an eye on your things at Shrikharka—I lost my trekking poles there.Tilicho Lake: A view, a void, and acceptance Morning arrived. We emptied our room and set out, uncertain if we’d return in time and head straight to Shrikharka or stay the night again at base camp. One friend battled altitude sickness but pushed on fiercely, even bargaining for a horse ride, only to find me eventually outpacing it.As I neared the lake, the solitude and distance overwhelmed me. I called my father, who offered only a few comforting words before the line dropped. Thankfully, friends from home Nuya and Shri reached out, and I poured my thoughts to them through tears. With renewed spirit, I moved forward and finally reached a quiet pond that tricked me into thinking I’d arrived. Only after some guidance did I stand before the actual Tilicho Lake.Strangely, I felt no rush of joy. The sight was majestic, yet my reaction fell flat. I asked myself if it was okay to feel so indifferent. However, I accepted that sometimes it’s okay to feel nothing at all. A simple “I don’t know” was all the answers I needed.We had no rooms left on our last night at base camp, so we slept in a dorm, which was a cheaper and warmer option. After dinner, my friends drifted off, but I lingered by the fire, unwilling to leave its comfort. The dining hall was full of trekkers glued to their seats even after finishing their food until a friendly trek guide offered us seats. These guides, cheerful and chatty, shared fun stories and gossip.Ultimately, I want to say to all who recently went trekking, whether funded by parents or your hard-earned savings, to be proud and grateful for the opportunity to explore. And for those who couldn’t go this time, trust that your moment will come. Keep moving forward with hope, knowing that one day, your adventure awaits.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon.

As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery.

The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” ","summary":"Chaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core.

And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” "},{"hash":"7ea85e731597bdeb1671d95bca3078159d53ed7499444aaf8b71b7db12d28349","title":"the-kumari-tradition-lives-on-balancing-ancient-and-modern-values","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/08/01/the-kumari-tradition-lives-on-balancing-ancient-and-modern-values","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/kumari-1722472781.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1722470400000,"source":"kp","category":"national","content":"In 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. ","summary":"What animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years.

Shifting snowfall and rainfall patterns due to climate change increase the region’s vulnerability. Cloudburst events are becoming more frequent, glaciers are retreating at an accelerated pace, snowfall is declining and permafrost is melting, leading to a cascade of multi-hazard events that cause substantial damage.While significant attention has been given to mapping glacial lakes larger than 0.02 square kilometres and monitoring a few potentially dangerous ones, other critical hazards, such as permafrost degradation and smaller, undocumented glacial lakes, have been overlooked. Additionally, there has been insufficient focus on minimising vulnerability and exposure downstream, which are the key components of disaster risk reduction.Glacial lake outburst floodsGlacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) occur when meltwater from glaciers accumulates behind an ice or moraine dam, which can fail due to overtopping caused by rising water levels or collapse resulting from melting of the ice core within the moraine dam. This failure often triggers external events such as avalanches or landslides into the lake. The GLOF event in April this year at Birendra Lake in Gorkha, Nepal, highlights the severe impact of glacier ice cascading into the lake. This sudden influx caused a sharp rise in water levels, leading to an overflow that inundated downstream areas. Earthquakes may also trigger the GLOF. The 2015 Gorkha earthquake brought about a GLOF in the Langtang Valley by destabilising the Langtang Glacier. The sudden release of large volumes of water generates catastrophic floods that can overwhelm river channels and pose severe risks to nearby communities and critical infrastructure like hydropower and bridges.On August 16, 2024, a GLOF devastated Thame, a Sherpa village in the Khumbu region, destroying 25 structures, including homes, guesthouses, a school and a hydropower project, while displacing 135 people. Additionally, the Khumbu region was severely impacted by the Dig Tsho GLOF in 1985, which caused widespread destruction, including the loss of lives, property and infrastructure. The 2021 Melamchi debris flow was triggered by monsoon rainfall and landslides and exacerbated by upstream glacial melt, leading to devastating floods and sediment-laden flows. Similarly, the 2012 Seti River flash flood in Pokhara was caused by a landslide-induced dam breach upstream, which released a massive volume of water, highlighting the cascading risks associated with glacial melt and moraine instability linked to GLOF phenomena. All these GLOF-related events underline the need for robust multihazard early warning systems, risk mitigation measures and strong design of critical infrastructures.In the Himalaya, GLOFs can trigger a series of landslide dam outburst floods (LDOFs) by releasing large volumes of water that destabilise slopes or transport debris downstream, causing landslides that dam rivers. The sudden surge of water and debris from a GLOF can block a river course, forming a temporary dam, which, if breached, results in a catastrophic LDOF.The recent Thame GLOF is a stark reminder of the urgent need for better disaster risk management and more comprehensive monitoring strategies in the Himalaya. It also points to a crucial gap in existing glacial lake inventories. This lake was not included in the inventory because its size fell below the minimum threshold for classification as a glacial lake. Despite its small size, the flood caused significant downstream damage, destroying houses and infrastructure. The potential for widespread destruction is immense, with thousands of such lakes scattered across the Himalaya.Permafrost degradationPermafrost is a soil, rock, or sediment layer that remains frozen for at least two consecutive years, typically found in polar and high-altitude regions. But this is rapidly degrading due to rising temperatures. This thawing process weakens moraine dams, increasing the risk of GLOFs. Thorthormi Lake in Bhutan is classified as high-risk because of permafrost degradation. Furthermore, thawing releases loose debris, which triggers debris flows during heavy rainfall or snowmelt. In India’s Ladakh region, recurring debris flows caused by permafrost degradation have severely impacted local communities and infrastructure. Another consequence of permafrost thaw is increased sedimentation in rivers and reservoirs. Thawed permafrost accelerates erosion, contributing to higher sediment loads, as observed in Pakistan’s Indus River Basin. This disrupts river dynamics and reduces the efficiency of hydropower projects or threatens the bridges.Permafrost thawing in Nepal is a critical yet overlooked issue, with no systematic monitoring or comprehensive studies to assess its status and impacts. The lack of awareness and action on this phenomenon leaves communities vulnerable to landslides, glacial lake outbursts, floods and sedimentation.Building resilienceGlacier retreat and permafrost thaw also undermine the stability of mountain slopes and infrastructure integrity. As glaciers and permafrost diminish, the once-stabilised rocks are now exposed, increasing the risk of landslides and debris flow. Several studies have reported the growing trend of large landslides and debris flow in the Himalayas over the last decade, which is associated with glacier decline.In the Hindu Kush Himalaya, the rising temperatures caused by climate change driving glacier melt and permafrost degradation is a global phenomenon, and reversing or halting these processes is beyond the practical scope of localised or national efforts. Reducing global warming or the effect of climate change is a long-term challenge, requiring worldwide commitment and immediate action. Similarly, while efforts like lowering water levels in glacial lakes are technically possible in select cases, as done with Nepal’s Tsho Rolpa and Imja Tsho, they only provide temporary relief. They are not sustainable solutions given the thousands of lakes already formed and the hundreds that emerge annually due to accelerating glacier melt. Given these limitations, a pragmatic and effective strategy focusing on managing vulnerability to climate-induced hazards through innovative risk assessments, resilient infrastructure and community engagement is imperative. Critical infrastructure such as hydropower plants, bridges, roads and settlements must be designed to accommodate high hydraulic forces and debris flows. Infrastructure planning should integrate hazard mapping and predictive modelling to avoid high-risk zones and reduce exposure.In addition to physical infrastructure, strengthening multihazard early warning systems and enhancing community preparedness are vital. Combining technological advancements with local knowledge enables timely evacuation and risk mitigation, minimising human and economic losses. Community-based disaster risk reduction is also crucial. Empowering local populations through education, participatory mapping and hazard preparedness can significantly reduce disaster impacts. Additionally, integrating insurance and reinsurance mechanisms tailored for Himalayan risks can further encourage investment in resilient infrastructure.Investing in research and innovation is equally critical. Remote sensing and machine learning technologies can improve hazard monitoring and predictive modelling, offering new insights into glacial dynamics and risk patterns. Incorporating future climate scenarios into risk assessments will help policymakers and communities prepare for the uncertainties of climate change.This isn't a national problem, as glacial melting in Tibet can also pose risks to Nepal and India. There needs to be a consensus among the countries in the Hindu Kush region for collaboration and information sharing on glaciers across borders. We can only comprehensively monitor the dangers posed by retreating glaciers and effectively prepare for potential disasters through such cooperation. ","summary":"The Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region is one of the world’s most fragile and hazard-prone regions. Shifting snowfall and rainfall patterns due to climate change increase the region’s vulnerability. Cloudburst events are becoming more frequent, glaciers are retreating at an accelerated pace, snowfall is declining and permafrost is melting, leading to a cascade of multi-hazard events that cause substantial damage.While significant attention has been given to mapping glacial lakes larger than 0.02 square kilometres and monitoring a few potentially dangerous ones, other critical hazards, such as permafrost degradation and smaller, undocumented glacial lakes, have been overlooked. Additionally, there has been insufficient focus on minimising vulnerability and exposure downstream, which are the key components of disaster risk reduction.Glacial lake outburst floodsGlacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) occur when meltwater from glaciers accumulates behind an ice or moraine dam, which can fail due to overtopping caused by rising water levels or collapse resulting from melting of the ice core within the moraine dam. This failure often triggers external events such as avalanches or landslides into the lake. The GLOF event in April this year at Birendra Lake in Gorkha, Nepal, highlights the severe impact of glacier ice cascading into the lake. This sudden influx caused a sharp rise in water levels, leading to an overflow that inundated downstream areas. Earthquakes may also trigger the GLOF. The 2015 Gorkha earthquake brought about a GLOF in the Langtang Valley by destabilising the Langtang Glacier. The sudden release of large volumes of water generates catastrophic floods that can overwhelm river channels and pose severe risks to nearby communities and critical infrastructure like hydropower and bridges.On August 16, 2024, a GLOF devastated Thame, a Sherpa village in the Khumbu region, destroying 25 structures, including homes, guesthouses, a school and a hydropower project, while displacing 135 people. Additionally, the Khumbu region was severely impacted by the Dig Tsho GLOF in 1985, which caused widespread destruction, including the loss of lives, property and infrastructure. The 2021 Melamchi debris flow was triggered by monsoon rainfall and landslides and exacerbated by upstream glacial melt, leading to devastating floods and sediment-laden flows. Similarly, the 2012 Seti River flash flood in Pokhara was caused by a landslide-induced dam breach upstream, which released a massive volume of water, highlighting the cascading risks associated with glacial melt and moraine instability linked to GLOF phenomena. All these GLOF-related events underline the need for robust multihazard early warning systems, risk mitigation measures and strong design of critical infrastructures.In the Himalaya, GLOFs can trigger a series of landslide dam outburst floods (LDOFs) by releasing large volumes of water that destabilise slopes or transport debris downstream, causing landslides that dam rivers. The sudden surge of water and debris from a GLOF can block a river course, forming a temporary dam, which, if breached, results in a catastrophic LDOF.The recent Thame GLOF is a stark reminder of the urgent need for better disaster risk management and more comprehensive monitoring strategies in the Himalaya. It also points to a crucial gap in existing glacial lake inventories. This lake was not included in the inventory because its size fell below the minimum threshold for classification as a glacial lake. Despite its small size, the flood caused significant downstream damage, destroying houses and infrastructure. The potential for widespread destruction is immense, with thousands of such lakes scattered across the Himalaya.Permafrost degradationPermafrost is a soil, rock, or sediment layer that remains frozen for at least two consecutive years, typically found in polar and high-altitude regions. But this is rapidly degrading due to rising temperatures. This thawing process weakens moraine dams, increasing the risk of GLOFs. Thorthormi Lake in Bhutan is classified as high-risk because of permafrost degradation. Furthermore, thawing releases loose debris, which triggers debris flows during heavy rainfall or snowmelt. In India’s Ladakh region, recurring debris flows caused by permafrost degradation have severely impacted local communities and infrastructure. Another consequence of permafrost thaw is increased sedimentation in rivers and reservoirs. Thawed permafrost accelerates erosion, contributing to higher sediment loads, as observed in Pakistan’s Indus River Basin. This disrupts river dynamics and reduces the efficiency of hydropower projects or threatens the bridges.Permafrost thawing in Nepal is a critical yet overlooked issue, with no systematic monitoring or comprehensive studies to assess its status and impacts. The lack of awareness and action on this phenomenon leaves communities vulnerable to landslides, glacial lake outbursts, floods and sedimentation.Building resilienceGlacier retreat and permafrost thaw also undermine the stability of mountain slopes and infrastructure integrity. As glaciers and permafrost diminish, the once-stabilised rocks are now exposed, increasing the risk of landslides and debris flow. Several studies have reported the growing trend of large landslides and debris flow in the Himalayas over the last decade, which is associated with glacier decline.In the Hindu Kush Himalaya, the rising temperatures caused by climate change driving glacier melt and permafrost degradation is a global phenomenon, and reversing or halting these processes is beyond the practical scope of localised or national efforts. Reducing global warming or the effect of climate change is a long-term challenge, requiring worldwide commitment and immediate action. Similarly, while efforts like lowering water levels in glacial lakes are technically possible in select cases, as done with Nepal’s Tsho Rolpa and Imja Tsho, they only provide temporary relief. They are not sustainable solutions given the thousands of lakes already formed and the hundreds that emerge annually due to accelerating glacier melt. Given these limitations, a pragmatic and effective strategy focusing on managing vulnerability to climate-induced hazards through innovative risk assessments, resilient infrastructure and community engagement is imperative. Critical infrastructure such as hydropower plants, bridges, roads and settlements must be designed to accommodate high hydraulic forces and debris flows. Infrastructure planning should integrate hazard mapping and predictive modelling to avoid high-risk zones and reduce exposure.In addition to physical infrastructure, strengthening multihazard early warning systems and enhancing community preparedness are vital. Combining technological advancements with local knowledge enables timely evacuation and risk mitigation, minimising human and economic losses. Community-based disaster risk reduction is also crucial. Empowering local populations through education, participatory mapping and hazard preparedness can significantly reduce disaster impacts. Additionally, integrating insurance and reinsurance mechanisms tailored for Himalayan risks can further encourage investment in resilient infrastructure.Investing in research and innovation is equally critical. Remote sensing and machine learning technologies can improve hazard monitoring and predictive modelling, offering new insights into glacial dynamics and risk patterns. Incorporating future climate scenarios into risk assessments will help policymakers and communities prepare for the uncertainties of climate change.This isn't a national problem, as glacial melting in Tibet can also pose risks to Nepal and India. There needs to be a consensus among the countries in the Hindu Kush region for collaboration and information sharing on glaciers across borders. We can only comprehensively monitor the dangers posed by retreating glaciers and effectively prepare for potential disasters through such cooperation.

What are the prospects for economic development and democratic evolution?Given the status of political party dynamics, geopolitical tussle and Nepal’s weak diplomatic capacity, Nepal’s prospects of economic development and democratic evolution look bleak at best. Oli’s efforts to emulate China’s growth model and political party discipline will also be undermined by the plurality of political parties and an ingrained kleptocratic system.GeopoliticsIn December, Nepal signed a landmark framework agreement with China on the Belt and Road Initiative after intense negotiations between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML on the one hand and between Nepal and China on the other. Nepal was able to revise and trim down China’s proposed “BRI Implementation Plan” according to Nepal’s priorities. However, Nepal’s proposal to develop the Nepal-China Friendship Park in Damak and consent to insert security and global initiatives in the joint communique, despite India’s concern, may have raised red flags.Nepal’s efforts to exercise strategic autonomy in the face of asymmetric power balance and geopolitical rivalry are undermined by several flaws. First, of course, is the political predilection, which heavily favours China. During several negotiations with China, Nepal’s bureaucracy and political leadership appear soft on China but hard on India. A series of events since 2008 shows that China has always favoured communist governments and that grants and aid disbursements tend to peak when leftist coalitions are in power.The second factor is Nepal’s inability to build trusted relations with China and India and ensure national interests. As China’s influence grows in Nepal, India has adopted a two-pronged policy of both engaging Nepal and adopting policy measures to limit the Chinese influence. There is a real possibility that India will continue to harden the border and create safeguards to limit Chinese access to the Indian market through Nepal. This will likely impact Nepal’s connectivity and trade with India in the future, which in turn will affect Nepal’s economic trajectory and viability of large infrastructure projects.The third is Nepali elites’ gradual alignment with Chinese interests and distancing from India. It has now become a paradox that while Nepal seeks to enjoy the privileges of the special arrangements ensured by the 1950 treaty with India, it wants to disregard India’s traditional interests in Nepal.One example is Pokhara Regional International Airport (PRIA). Two years after its inauguration, it has seen only 10 international flights, all of them chartered or relief efforts. The officials of CAAN do not have any reasonable near term strategy to make the airport financially viable or to service debts. The situation is so dire that an ordinary Airbus 319 flight from Pokhara to Kathmandu last week was highlighted with much fanfare by the Nepali media.Regional power dynamics, particularly with India, have affected the airport’s viability. When the PRIA was being considered, bilateral relations were invoked—the airport was framed as “critical” to Nepal-China relations. During its inauguration, China positioned the airport as part of BRI and the Trans Himalayan Multidimensional Connectivity Network.Media reports this week widely discussed the worsening relationship between Oli and India. Indian media reported that although Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba was on a private visit to India, she was disappointed not to meet senior leaders. She was hoping to push forward the agenda of Oli’s visit to India. As India appears to ignore him, Oli, meanwhile, is cozying up to Pakistan and attempting to revive SAARC.PoliticsAnother significant arena is politics and the direction of Nepal’s democracy.It is now well accepted that Nepal is in a “low-growth, high migration trap”. With structural and psychological pressures getting worse, political disruption is possible if the current political regime is unable to deliver economic growth and governance reforms.However, Nepal’s politics shows no signs of reforms or the willingness to address underlying factors that have trapped Nepal in a low-growth, high-migration dynamics.The three primary sources of power in Nepal’s political parties are the relative position of party leaders in the national kleptocracy, their bonds with China and India, and their relationship with political competitors. Membership in the entrenched national kleptocracy ensures that party leaders can extract resources from the state and obtain rent even if they do not hold any official public position.Nepal’s inability to address corruption and money laundering was reflected in the Mutual Evaluation Review of the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) on Money Laundering. Last week, the Nepal Rastra Bank governor, Maha Prasad Adhikari, gave dire news to the Prime Minister that the APG may be losing patience with Nepal.According to an expedited follow up report, Nepal has made some progress in addressing technical compliance deficiencies. While Nepal has taken some legislative measures, their effectiveness is questionable and several recommendations remain unsatisfactory.Internally, Nepal’s three major parties have their own problems. While the UML appeared to be on a path to emulate the Communist Party of China, there were signs that the internal power balance of other major parties was transforming, including in the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre.According to a Naya Patrika report, Oli is enamoured by China’s development model and the Communist Party of China. He wants to introduce tough disciplinary measures to “unify” the party and align every member around the top leadership. Only last week, the party took disciplinary action against three popular figures who dared to question Oli’s authoritarian streak and his hobnobbing with crony capitalists. The action created ripples in the political sphere although UML members kept quiet, indicating that exercising freedom of expression in the party would come at a great cost.A large chunk of the Nepali electorate is already ideologically aligned with leftist forces. Now, party leaders of the UML will have both threat power and agenda-setting power to control dissent and differences in the party–a fertile environment for leaders with authoritarian streaks.When he came to power in 2018, Oli took several policy initiatives, though unsuccessful, to enforce his vision on the society, curtailing freedom of expression and constricting the space for civil society. He also centralised regulatory and legal authorities and made selective use of power to weaken his political opponents.Incidents in the last few months indicate he has not changed.

The Constitution of Nepal recognises gender and sexual minorities, which even developed countries like the US don’t explicitly mention.

While these achievements seem noteworthy at the outset, there is still a huge disparity between the laws and the reality queer people face every day. In Nepal, while much of the activism for the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community still focuses on something as basic as identity and legal recognition, issues like the sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR) of these communities remain overlooked. Although the Constitution of Nepal ensures fundamental rights, such as reproductive rights under the Safe Motherhood and Reproductive Health Act (2018) for gender and sexual minorities, these provisions haven’t effectively catered to the sexual and reproductive health of these communities.The discrimination and stigma that gender and sexual minorities face daily manifests in their general inaccessibility of fundamental rights in Nepal. Programmes related to SRHR are usually associated with cisgender women and ignore LGBTQIA+ individuals. Queer folks are judged and ridiculed not just by their family members but also by the health staff at hospitals and health posts. This is problematic in a country where transgender people are forced to undergo surgery for medical verification to be legally recognised as “male” or “female”. Gender-affirming surgery requires medical professionals to follow certain clinical protocols; however, the existing law does not address gender reassignment. In August, the Supreme Court made landmark progress in recognising LGBTQIA+ rights by ruling that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, must be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without requiring medical verification; however, the law for legal recognition remains the same for all. So, these individuals have no option but to travel to India for surgeries, which can be expensive and unsafe. Moreover, transgender men, lesbians and bisexual individuals often struggle to access basic menstrual hygiene products and healthcare facilities related to safe motherhood and abortion. The path to having and parenting children is fraught with difficulties for queer individuals, as IVF and adoption facilities aren’t accessible. While surrogacy is legal for infertile married Nepali couples, it is prohibited for singles, transgender couples and foreign nationals.Many people have the misconception that only cisgender women menstruate, but anyone with a uterus can experience it. These narratives arise through the limited awareness of our society and restrictive school curriculums. Such a perpetuation of false ideas further influences dominant ideas in popular platforms. Rarely do we see people from the LGBTQIA+ communities in the advertisements of sanitary pads or contraceptives.

He had direct and indirect involvement in the peace deals even before the Maoists joined mainstream politics. Currently a chair at the Nepal Transition to Peace, an organisation with a long history of peace facilitation, Mallik has closely followed the developments in the transitional justice process. With the process at a crossroads after the committee to select the office-bearers in two transitional justice commissions failed to accomplish its task, the Post’s Binod Ghimire sat with him to talk about the future course of transitional justice. Excerpts: Amid growing hope, the transitional justice process has stalled again after the selection committee failed to recommend the chairs and members of the two transitional justice commissions. What do you think went wrong?Based on my conversations with some members of the recommendation committee, I can say that differences in the panel over the name of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission chair led to the failure of the selection. While members [representing different parties] wanted to pick someone [Sudip Pathak] pushed by political parties, even with heavy hearts, others warned to register dissent in the decision. Instead of recommending names through a majority decision, the committee chose not to recommend anyone.It is painful to see the process stall. After several open and secret negotiations between the major forces, including the Nepal Army, the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry and Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act was amended. We facilitated many such negotiations. The amendment became possible only after the CPN-UML and its chair, KP Sharma Oli, an incumbent prime minister, were convinced. Amendment to the Act had created a positive environment.However, the old habits of the parties in power—the Nepali Congress in this case—to fit their people in every institution sabotaged the hard-built positive environment. This is unfortunate.Don’t you think it was insincere on the part of the former chief justice-led committee to exhaust its deadline without completing its duty?This is not uncommon in our country. But I don’t mean there was no problem with the committee itself. I see problems in its composition and also in its terms of reference (ToR). There were doubts over the committee right from its formation, after the same person [Om Prakash Mishra] was entrusted with the responsibility of selecting the office-bearers for the second time. Despite the selection panel not inspiring much hope, the victims and other stakeholders had critical engagement because “something was better than nothing.” Also, the criteria set by the TJ Act for the chairs of the commissions don’t reflect the skills those leading the transitional justice process need. This is not a court proceeding where one needs to be a Supreme Court justice. The criteria need to be revised through an amendment to the Act. The ToR for the selection committee has been devised in a way that it would, for example, select a chief executive officer in a company or a head of some government offices. The ritualistic and formal selection process cannot find the best-suited persons to lead the transitional justice proceedings. Only those who can connect with the victims or dig out the information related to the perpetrators can lead the commissions to success. Nobody will reveal the truth unless s/he trusts and has faith in the persons leading the commissions.The selection committee could have recommended anyone from the shortlist it had prepared. However, I fail to believe they would have seen to the success of the process.Do you agree with the prime minister’s claim that only political figures can lead this process?I agree to the extent that we need a towering personality who has connections with common people. However, the Act seeks technical qualities in the chairs of the commissions, a provision which needs to be revised. Technocrats cannot lead them. A political figure can lead the process, but s/he should be widely acceptable among the stakeholders and should be able to resist the petty partisan interest.Transitional justice is often taken as a political process. Again, there are concerns about politicisation. What is the demarcation line for political engagement?Being political and being into partisan politics are two different issues. For instance, Padma Ratna Tuladhar, despite getting elected with the UML’s election symbol, held an independent image. We can find such figures who can throw away their political hats once they take vital responsibilities. They can win the trust of the victims while also engaging the perpetrators. While discharging their duties, they can stay uninfluenced by the leadership of the party that chose them.It is not possible to find a universally accepted character in such a fragmented society, where even conflict victims remain poles apart on several issues. The best-suited candidate to lead the process can ensure the critical engagement of all concerned stakeholders.On the other hand, political parties must understand that their role is limited to facilitating the process. They could help by making the commissions resourceful, ensuring a proper legal framework is in place, and cooperating in every stage of the process, from truth-seeking to prosecution. The day they are seen meddling, the process will lose its credibility and will fail.Why do you think the previous commissions failed twice? Was it only because of flawed law?No sooner had the commissions been formed than the Act was challenged in the Supreme Court, which turned down several of its provisions. It was natural that they couldn’t deliver, as the court partially rejected the law under which they were formed. Subsequent governments couldn’t ensure its timely amendment. Yet, they successfully collected the complaints while carrying out some bureaucratic work. Therefore, I don’t accept that they wasted their time doing nothing. The delaying tactics of the political leadership and the government are more responsible for not allowing the commissions to succeed. While law revision was delayed on various pretexts, the commissions were deprived of resources. During negotiations on an amendment bill, I witnessed a situation where the Maoist Centre and the security forces brought already settled issues to controversy even though the UML’s representatives were positive about giving it a final shape.That day, I realised that it was wrong to blame the UML alone for the delay in the amendment. I could sense a fear factor gripping the forces that were directly engaged in the conflict.Are you suggesting that the parties involved in conflict fear being dragged into prosecution?I could sense that. No matter which country’s example you cite, the transitional justice process is not complete without prosecution. It would be wrong to believe that the entire process will be concluded through reparations. It won’t be acceptable at home, nor will the international community validate it. Does it mean all the cases will be prosecuted? No. This is also radical thinking. I believe it is possible to heal the wounds of the conflict if the process is handled responsibly.Is the amended Act progressive enough to allow the healing process?This sets a critical minimum standard for justice. The amendment was possible as the parties, mainly the UML, which had been holding to a position for years, compromised to get the Act amended. Not everything needs to be written. Several of its shortcomings can be corrected during practice if competent people get appointed to the commissions. If some provisions still create obstacles, they can be amended. A lot is possible if there is willpower and sincere effort to conclude the process.The Act sets four years to conclude the process. Do you think it is enough to investigate so many cases?The investigation process needs to be decentralised. The commissions can recruit experts for primary investigation. They can be deployed at the district level or even at the local units, depending on the volume of the cases from the respective places. Based on their findings, the commissions can decide how to take them ahead.The Act also envisions setting up different units within the TRC to decide on reparation or to look after sexual violence cases. They can complete significant work within four years if they are well-resourced and work effectively. Without willpower, they can waste a couple of years just setting up offices and recruiting the staff. And they will opt for an extension of tenure like their predecessors did.The international community welcomed the amendment even before the President authenticated it, though victims and different human rights bodies had reservations. Does it indicate a change in the community’s position?I would say their position has become more realistic. It is realistic because there is no set standard for transitional justice. They have a consensus that Nepal can develop its own model without compromising on basic human rights principles. I don’t think they are interested in prescribing any model, be it Columbian or others. I believe they will welcome our process if it moves ahead without compromising on the parameters set by the current law. The United Nations and the bilateral partners are ready to provide resources if the commissions start functioning based on the present law. They genuinely want to see the long-pending process conclude.I personally believe that Nepal can be a better example than Colombia, which is still deeply conflict-ridden. This can happen even before the conclusion of the process if the two commissions take the right track and generate hope for justice among the victims.  ","summary":"Former minister and secretary Vidyadhar Mallik has long been involved as a facilitator in peace negotiations.

The party, which has 10 seats in the federal lower house is struggling with organisation building, re-elected Nepal as party chief in July. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Chairman Nepal to hear his assessment of the new party’s three years and his future plans for it.How do you review the first three years of your party?First, we have to start with the question of if the formation of this party was necessary. We made the absolutely right move by revolting [against the CPN-UML leadership’s actions]. We foiled the attempts to trample on the constitution and stopped the autocratic, regressive, rightist and individualistic tendencies from prevailing in Nepali politics. Our moves have been politically, legally as well as constitutionally justified, with even the Supreme Court validating them. After that, we displaced the then [KP Sharma Oli-led] government, and brought national politics on the right track. We then formed this party. Politics doesn’t always go in a straight line. In politics, you face ups and downs, twists and turns and sometimes turbulence. Those who are powerful today could become weak and may disappear over time. Weaker forces may get stronger. Some of our friends say, “Our revolt was right but joining the coalition was wrong”. But it was the need of the time. It is true that we committed some mistakes and couldn’t get enough proportional representation (PR) votes in federal and provincial polls in 2022. We were unnecessarily flexible while making seat allocations with other coalition partners in a number of constituencies. We also strongly opposed the proposals of coalition partners in certain constituencies and fought on our own strength and won seats. For instance, the CPN (Maoist Centre) didn’t cooperate with us in my own constituency in Rautahat. They didn’t vote for us. But I still won. We fought elections in some palikas [local units] on our own and won majority seats there. But in certain areas our local leaders couldn’t properly negotiate with other partners. Now we should neither be over-reliant on the election coalitions nor do we need to criticise it. Others will recognise us only if we increase our strength. We have had mixed experiences in the past three years. We should be encouraged and optimistic about the future.But our observation from outside is that your party failed in the elections. It couldn’t even secure national party status and you have done poorly on the organisation front as well. The situation would be drastically different had all the friends who were initially with us remained active with firm commitment. Some friends lost confidence. Therefore, we couldn’t perform as per the expectations. But our party has produced exemplary results in Madhes Province. We were doing well in Rautahat district even until the latest by-polls. My activeness has never diminished and I have left no stone unturned in terms of inspiring other leaders. But everyone should actively work to build a party. Some people talk big but don’t take responsibility.You touched on what went wrong in terms of securing PR votes. Could you elaborate?Our situation would be much better had we fielded more candidates, at least in provincial seats. Our party chapters and members would have been more active in the constituencies if our candidates were in the field. The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal made a smart move in this connection. The JSP fielded more candidates for provincial seats. From the start, JSP leaders used to wonder in coalition meetings about how they would get PR votes if their candidates aren’t in the constituencies. As our party members joined the campaigns for common candidates of the coalition, they couldn’t ask for votes in our party’s election symbol ‘pen’ in the PR category. Had we mobilised separate teams to campaign for the PR votes, we could have easily crossed the threshold for PR seats in the House of Representatives. Don’t you think the party is top-heavy with senior leaders while failing to attract new faces?We have no dearth of leaders or cadres. But we have a problem in mobilising them. In our party, the monitoring and evaluation system is weak. You can’t make one answerable unless you have an evaluation system in writing. Therefore, this time we have assigned responsibilities for just a year. Now they have to submit periodic reports of activities in their respective committees. We became too lenient and didn’t punish those who didn’t work. You led a huge organisation in the UML for one-and-half decades. But you appear to be struggling to fix issues in this relatively small organisation.See, people are becoming more selfish, self-centered and lazy. So, we have to make our evaluation system strong. As we have a strong organisation and the right ideology and values, we should now launch pro-people movements and connect with the public.Do you think the party failed to attract and mobilise people due to its continuous engagement in the government since formation and lack of attractive agenda?We don’t lack agendas. We have identified and enlisted many issues directly linked to the people’s livelihood in our political paper. We failed to reach the doorsteps of the people. For instance, if there is violence against a woman, our women chapter should immediately reach there. Likewise, the student wing should actively work for the rights of students. Some of our friends say we shouldn’t have stood in favour of endorsement of the MCC [Millennium Challenge Corporation’s compact]. They argued it was being implemented to encircle our neighbour China and establish a military base in our country. We suspected the same. But our country had already signed on to that. Different interpretations of the concept related to the project emerged. Some described it as a part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy. When we studied the matter, we found CPN-UML chair KP Oli was all set to endorse the compact without any changes in the text, bypassing us. Oli put forward five conditions for that before then prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. The conditions included impeaching Speaker Agni Sapkota for not taking action against us [UML had demanded that the Speaker strip 14 lawmakers who quit UML to form the new party of their positions], scrapping our party’s registration in the Election Commission and removing us from the coalition. But Deuba ji stood against that. Then, we found a middle way, which was to endorse the compact with a 12-point explanatory note. So that was the right decision. The government earlier this month signed the framework for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation agreement with China. What is your view on this?It is natural to take it [BRI] forward as we have implemented the MCC of the US and have joined hands with other countries and multilateral agencies to carry out our development activities. The projects to be built under the BRI have no strategic or military connections and are based on mutual benefit. So there is no need to be suspicious and we have to focus on how to take maximum benefits from projects under the BRI.Just a few days ago, you met and talked to Bamdev Gautam, who appears ready to join your party. What is the progress on this?He has said he is ready to join and accept our party’s decisions. We are discussing this. He has played an important role in critical political junctures. He strongly supported me during the second People’s Movement in 2006. A political party needs such leaders. We are thinking of concluding this process [of welcoming him] soon.What about Bhim Rawal joining the party?Unhappy with the party leadership, he has been inactive in the UML but he has not made up his mind to join our party.Is finalising Gautam’s hierarchy and role in the party taking time?There won’t be an issue in the case of Bamdev ji. But overall, the number of leaders in our party is big. In the Chinese Communist Party, there are only seven members in the Politburo Standing Committee and 17 members in Other Politburo Members. But there are 24 members in our party’s central secretariat, 41 in the standing committee and 108 members in the politburo. Those who get a candidacy in the election celebrate but those who don’t get a ticket become inactive. Some others fight for ministerial posts. Yet others complain about not getting a ‘lucrative’ ministry. We have to manage them all.What about reunifying the party with the UML or the Maoist Centre? Many say leaders are more comfortable with the Maoist Centre but party cadres are for rejoining the UML.Most of our cadres are from the UML background. That might have played a role. But at present there is no possibility of our reunification with the UML. Also, the situation isn’t right to forge unity with the Maoist Centre.It is said that there is pressure from party members for reunification with the UML?That’s not true. There is a negative view about us in the UML and therefore our party rank and file wouldn’t be ready to surrender. Some might be lobbying for entry into the UML for personal benefits. Even if some join the UML, it won’t be easy for them there.But some noted leaders such as Ram Kumari Jhakri who had strongly supported you in the course of building this party have said that the Unified Socialist can’t run like this and that it is better to merge with the UML?I also enquired about her remarks but she said her intent had been misunderstood. But I repeat that there is no possibility of unity with the UML. We studied the possibility of unity with the Maoist Centre but concluded that we can’t accept Maoism and we also found their election symbol inappropriate. So the process has stopped. For now, we will concentrate on strengthening our own party.How is the Unified Socialist different from the UML?Our’s is a policy-driven party and not leader-centric. Committee system prevails in our organisation, not the leader’s orders. We discard rightist approaches and follow revolutionary ideas. We don’t see these qualities in the UML. Only our party has a policy of ‘Socialism with Nepali Characteristics’. We prioritise our agenda based on justice, fair distribution, production and good governance. There was a period when socialism stressed only on equality and therefore some termed it a distribution of poverty but we believe socialism as a principle of prosperity. Capitalism focuses only on profits even at the cost of people’s lives and wars but socialism values people’s lives and livelihoods. So, we are clearly against capitalism and in favour of socialism. But there are different forms of capitalism. We are for promoting national capitalism and eliminating comprador capitalists. We need to invite and welcome foreign investment to increase production in the country.Your party held its general convention in July first week and it took months to elect other office bearers and assign roles and responsibilities. Why?It shouldn’t have happened. Some wrong elements entered our party. Some showed immaturity by raising the issue of ‘new generation’. That spoiled the situation. Building a party is not easy. It calls for many things including ideological clarity, capacity to lead the organisation efficiently and an accepted personality. We have to learn from this episode and remove the mistrust that cropped up in this course. ","summary":"The CPN (Unified Socialist) was formed in August 2021 by a group of dissident CPN-UML leaders including two former party chiefs and ex-prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal. The party, which has 10 seats in the federal lower house is struggling with organisation building, re-elected Nepal as party chief in July. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Chairman Nepal to hear his assessment of the new party’s three years and his future plans for it.How do you review the first three years of your party?First, we have to start with the question of if the formation of this party was necessary. We made the absolutely right move by revolting [against the CPN-UML leadership’s actions]. We foiled the attempts to trample on the constitution and stopped the autocratic, regressive, rightist and individualistic tendencies from prevailing in Nepali politics. Our moves have been politically, legally as well as constitutionally justified, with even the Supreme Court validating them. After that, we displaced the then [KP Sharma Oli-led] government, and brought national politics on the right track. We then formed this party. Politics doesn’t always go in a straight line. In politics, you face ups and downs, twists and turns and sometimes turbulence. Those who are powerful today could become weak and may disappear over time. Weaker forces may get stronger.

How is the coalition of the two biggest political parties faring? The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Krishna Khanal, a professor of political science, for his insights.How do you evaluate the performance of the Congress-UML government based on the pledges they made at the time of coalition formation?Two biggest parties getting together to form a government is a bit unusual in the system we have adopted. The strength of the system is that the government can be made accountable by a strong opposition. But when the two biggest parties join hands to run the government, the opposition in the House becomes weak. This is a concern. The Congress and the UML have had joint governments in critical junctures in the past. Now, there is no extraordinary situation requiring them to forge a coalition but they justified it saying it would end political instability. Their argument was that unreasonable bargaining of smaller parties made the prime ministers weak. That’s partially true. However, the crux of the matter is that they wanted to enjoy consolidated power. KP Oli wanted to be prime minister and the Congress leaders who were out of power wanted to return to Singha Durbar. So they signed the seven-point deal with the pledge of amending the constitution.Has this coalition been a success? What are the initial indications?There are certain curious things. The seven-point agreement doesn’t say the UML will hand over government leadership to the Congress in the second phase of their partnership. It says, after two years, UML chair Oli will hand it over to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. It shows how our parties have become leader-centric instead of institution-centric. After all, Oli and Deuba are the chiefs and parliamentary leaders of their respective parties and they are the ones who will lead the government. Still they wished to specifically mention their names, which indicates they still feel insecure. Likewise, Prime Minister Oli says that he is handing over power to Deuba in July 2026. Recently he said he is handing it over after 18 months. Despite there being a written agreement, he keeps repeating the timeline. This suggests mutual mistrust due to past records of betrayal. It is true that the Congress and the UML together have a strong majority in the House and, with the backing of a few other smaller forces, they can manage two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. But when it comes to political issues, even the small parties in the coalition are hardly on the same page. So numerical strength alone won’t work. Hence there has been no progress on constitution amendment in the past five months. These pledges were made just to create a pretext to get to power.Is the present government any different to the erstwhile Dahal-led coalition, particularly on delivery?No. In the seven-point agreement, they pledged to improve the ailing economy. We don’t find any reform and the economy is still stagnant. I can’t recall a single thing this government has done that is worth appreciating. The only thing this coalition has achieved is ending unusual power manoeuverings by Prachanda [Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. The way Dahal was switching alliance partners between the Congress and the UML was unnatural. The present coalition ended the trend, at least for now. Also, some unhealthy activities taking place in provinces have been stopped. But the government has utterly failed to provide any relief to the people. What about the process of amending the constitution?The Congress and the UML leaders have often blamed the proportional representation (PR) electoral system for the country’s political instability. The UML proposed to limit the scope of the PR system to the National Assembly and some Congress leaders have also floated this idea. After the formation of this government, many people assumed that this coalition may take some action to implement those propositions. But doing so is not easy. Despite a strong majority in the House, the Congress and the UML alone can’t amend the constitution. Other small parties won’t support them to water down the PR system. The top leaders are conspicuously silent as they know diverse issues are going to open up once they start the process. For instance, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party wants to revive Hindu monarchy and the Madhes-based parties have their own grievances. Moreover, if you analyse the election results since 2008, it’s not difficult to infer that not only small parties but even the major forces will think twice before making any changes to the PR system. Be it big or small, old or new parties, all have gotten a significant number of seats under the PR category. In the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008, the Congress and the UML were in crisis. It was the PR system that saved them from being pushed into an existential crisis. Besides that, there is one big political reason behind the adoption of this electoral system and that is to ensure representation of various underprivileged communities in state organs. We can’t forget that context. Hence the Congress and UML leaders have been silent on the constitution amendment in the past couple of months.Is there any need to review or amend the constitution?There is a need to seriously review and analyse the problems faced in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. For instance, the vice-president has no role. He can be made ex-officio chair of the National Assembly, as in India. Then, the state doesn’t need to elect the upper house chair. This option was discussed during constitution writing as well. Recently, we conducted by-polls to fill the vacant positions of chiefs of local units. These polls were unnecessary as there can be a provision to entrust the deputy chiefs with the responsibility of carrying out the chief’s duties when the position goes vacant. There is a need for a comprehensive review and changes in some provisions based on the practical experience of statute implementation. But there are different parties and groups that want to raise different political agendas. For instance, some want a more powerful federal system while others want to scrap the system and revive Hindu monarchy. How should we review the national charter and what kind of mechanism will be right for that?The best way is through a review commission composed of politicians and subject experts. But leaders don’t trust independent experts who don’t follow their instructions. Forming a body of experts loyal to the leaders is meaningless. Therefore, a special parliamentary committee can be entrusted with this task. The panel will be composed of members from political parties based on their strength in the House. The parties and other stakeholders can submit their formal proposals to the committee and the experts can give their inputs to the same panel. The body can help give shape to the ongoing debates and discussions will take place in a more organised and formal way. It can conduct a thorough study of the complications seen in the course of constitution implementation. My emphasis is not on amending the constitution on political grounds but from the perspectives of removing difficulties experienced in the course of implementation. For instance, provinces have failed to prove their relevance. Now, we need to study where the problems are. But I don’t think the political parties are going to work on this issue with the seriousness it deserves. Leaders, of late, have proposed to increase the threshold to secure seats under the PR category, which can be done by amending election laws. They have floated the idea of increasing the PR threshold to five percent. [At present, it is three percent at the federal and 1.5 percent at the provincial level]. If it is increased to five percent, hardly four or five political parties may qualify for the PR seats. So this is not an appropriate proposal. To ensure political stability, we have to instead develop a system supportive of a coalition culture. The problem lies in our leaders and not in the constitution. For instance, why did Prachanda switch alliances multiple times after the last election? There is no point in blaming the system for instability. To discuss and debate all these issues, we need a review body.What is your analysis of the recent local by-polls results?The voting pattern shows that the big parties couldn’t increase their vote shares and failed to attract voters. The Congress lost more seats in comparison to the last by-polls. The UML had mixed results while the Maoist Centre made some gains. As it fought single-handedly this time, the Congress lost some seats that it had won with the support of alliance partners last time. This is natural. The Maoist Centre appears to have benefitted by being in the opposition and as it concentrated its strengths in select areas for the past few months. Party chief Dahal himself visited some remote local units. The Congress doesn’t appear serious about reviewing its poor performance while the UML has decided to study the matter and find what went wrong. The Maoist leaders look excited but the party has not made much progress in popular votes. There are assumptions of some informal collaborations between the Maoist Centre and the Rastriya Swatantra Party. The way Dahal has defended Rabi Lamichhane in recent days backs the assumption.Why do you think the performance of new forces including the RSP and Janamat were poor in the by-polls?My assumption is that voters rethought the need to change the party of their choice if the main objective of the leaders from new parties is to be ministers. RSP chief Rabi Lamichhane insisted on becoming home minister. In the meantime, recent investigations have shown his linkages to cooperative scams. People might have thought that he is not a clean person. These factors might have played a role. Last time, people supported new forces not to make their leaders ministers but for political reforms. The chief minister from Janamat Party who is leading the provincial government in Madhesh formed a 20-member Cabinet, which is the biggest ever there. He downsized it only after severe criticism. Such developments certainly play a role in elections. These are just assumptions. We can’t jump to conclusions but it is safe to say that Nepali voters are consistently trying to find better alternatives.While there were reports of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari rejoining the UML to return to active politics, former Vice-President Nanda Bahadur Pun is most likely to join the Maoist Centre. What kind of precedent will this set?I don’t see serious problems in former vice-presidents rejoining active politics as they don’t play any vital role as vice-presidents. But the issue of former Presidents returning to active politics is serious as such a precedent will invite serious anomalies. Though the constitution and laws don't bar former presidents from making such a comeback, politics should be guided by certain values, principles and convictions. Bhandari’s return to active politics will be unfortunate. It should be stopped.

After the formation of this government, many people assumed that this coalition may take some action to implement those propositions. But doing so is not easy. Despite a strong majority in the House, the Congress and the UML alone can’t amend the constitution. Other small parties won’t support them to water down the PR system. The top leaders are conspicuously silent as they know diverse issues are going to open up once they start the process. For instance, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party wants to revive Hindu monarchy and the Madhes-based parties have their own grievances. Moreover, if you analyse the election results since 2008, it’s not difficult to infer that not only small parties but even the major forces will think twice before making any changes to the PR system. Be it big or small, old or new parties, all have gotten a significant number of seats under the PR category. In the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008, the Congress and the UML were in crisis. It was the PR system that saved them from being pushed into an existential crisis. Besides that, there is one big political reason behind the adoption of this electoral system and that is to ensure representation of various underprivileged communities in state organs. We can’t forget that context. Hence the Congress and UML leaders have been silent on the constitution amendment in the past couple of months.Is there any need to review or amend the constitution?There is a need to seriously review and analyse the problems faced in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. For instance, the vice-president has no role. He can be made ex-officio chair of the National Assembly, as in India. Then, the state doesn’t need to elect the upper house chair. This option was discussed during constitution writing as well. Recently, we conducted by-polls to fill the vacant positions of chiefs of local units. These polls were unnecessary as there can be a provision to entrust the deputy chiefs with the responsibility of carrying out the chief’s duties when the position goes vacant. There is a need for a comprehensive review and changes in some provisions based on the practical experience of statute implementation. But there are different parties and groups that want to raise different political agendas. For instance, some want a more powerful federal system while others want to scrap the system and revive Hindu monarchy. How should we review the national charter and what kind of mechanism will be right for that?The best way is through a review commission composed of politicians and subject experts. But leaders don’t trust independent experts who don’t follow their instructions. Forming a body of experts loyal to the leaders is meaningless. Therefore, a special parliamentary committee can be entrusted with this task. The panel will be composed of members from political parties based on their strength in the House. The parties and other stakeholders can submit their formal proposals to the committee and the experts can give their inputs to the same panel. The body can help give shape to the ongoing debates and discussions will take place in a more organised and formal way. It can conduct a thorough study of the complications seen in the course of constitution implementation. My emphasis is not on amending the constitution on political grounds but from the perspectives of removing difficulties experienced in the course of implementation. For instance, provinces have failed to prove their relevance. Now, we need to study where the problems are. But I don’t think the political parties are going to work on this issue with the seriousness it deserves. Leaders, of late, have proposed to increase the threshold to secure seats under the PR category, which can be done by amending election laws. They have floated the idea of increasing the PR threshold to five percent. [At present, it is three percent at the federal and 1.5 percent at the provincial level]. If it is increased to five percent, hardly four or five political parties may qualify for the PR seats. So this is not an appropriate proposal. To ensure political stability, we have to instead develop a system supportive of a coalition culture. The problem lies in our leaders and not in the constitution. For instance, why did Prachanda switch alliances multiple times after the last election? There is no point in blaming the system for instability. To discuss and debate all these issues, we need a review body.What is your analysis of the recent local by-polls results?The voting pattern shows that the big parties couldn’t increase their vote shares and failed to attract voters. The Congress lost more seats in comparison to the last by-polls. The UML had mixed results while the Maoist Centre made some gains. As it fought single-handedly this time, the Congress lost some seats that it had won with the support of alliance partners last time. This is natural. The Maoist Centre appears to have benefitted by being in the opposition and as it concentrated its strengths in select areas for the past few months. Party chief Dahal himself visited some remote local units. The Congress doesn’t appear serious about reviewing its poor performance while the UML has decided to study the matter and find what went wrong. The Maoist leaders look excited but the party has not made much progress in popular votes. There are assumptions of some informal collaborations between the Maoist Centre and the Rastriya Swatantra Party. The way Dahal has defended Rabi Lamichhane in recent days backs the assumption.Why do you think the performance of new forces including the RSP and Janamat were poor in the by-polls?My assumption is that voters rethought the need to change the party of their choice if the main objective of the leaders from new parties is to be ministers. RSP chief Rabi Lamichhane insisted on becoming home minister. In the meantime, recent investigations have shown his linkages to cooperative scams. People might have thought that he is not a clean person. These factors might have played a role. Last time, people supported new forces not to make their leaders ministers but for political reforms. The chief minister from Janamat Party who is leading the provincial government in Madhesh formed a 20-member Cabinet, which is the biggest ever there. He downsized it only after severe criticism. Such developments certainly play a role in elections. These are just assumptions. We can’t jump to conclusions but it is safe to say that Nepali voters are consistently trying to find better alternatives.While there were reports of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari rejoining the UML to return to active politics, former Vice-President Nanda Bahadur Pun is most likely to join the Maoist Centre. What kind of precedent will this set?I don’t see serious problems in former vice-presidents rejoining active politics as they don’t play any vital role as vice-presidents. But the issue of former Presidents returning to active politics is serious as such a precedent will invite serious anomalies. Though the constitution and laws don't bar former presidents from making such a comeback, politics should be guided by certain values, principles and convictions. Bhandari’s return to active politics will be unfortunate. It should be stopped.

During the visit, the two countries signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Framework Cooperation agreement. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Bishnu Rimal, chief advisor to the prime minister, who was one of the key interlocutors during the framework agreement negotiations, for insights on how the deals were finalised between the two countries.There are many queries about the details of the agreements signed between Nepal and China last week. Please tell us about the key points.Nepal and China had been exchanging documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative of China since 2020, under the BRI implementation plan. While signing any agreement, the two countries engage in rigorous negotiations and at times it takes a long time even to finalise a word. This time, we signed a framework agreement, which is like a basket, where we have put many things. It’s different from a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In the agreement, we have described its background, principles, objectives, the modality of mobilising financial resources and implementing mechanisms. Even the previous government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to finalise it but it didn’t in the end. Now we have taken it ahead. The new agreement should be understood in a context. In 2016, we were in government [during Oli’s first tenure] and we visited Beijing. At the time, China was supporting Nepal through the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) package. Later, the support was provided through the BRI and the THMDCN became a part of it. Nepal reached an MoU to this effect in 2017. After that, an implementation plan needed to be signed. Following the formation of the present government, we held discussions on this. The two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a four-member team for this specific purpose. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and lawyer Semanta Dahal from the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Khatiwada ji and myself from the UML were in the team. In the past, we have reached several agreements with China, India, the United States, Japan and various other countries and sought support from them. But we haven’t been able to properly utilise the support. Our [taskforce’s] focus was to ensure best use of the pledged amount and implement the agreements. At first, we studied the documents exchanged after 2020. At the beginning we forged consensus between the UML and the Congress and then shared the document with the Chinese side because it can only be implemented after it is acceptable for both sides. This time, we wanted to take the implementation process ahead because Nepal joined the BRI process years ago. Nepal has already joined China’s Global Development Initiative, which is an international development concept. But there were some confusions about our participation in development projects under the BRI. There needed to be more clarity on our side. At times, it has been dragged into controversy. We wanted to dispel rumours and confusions.First of all we all should know that the BRI is a framework and the agreement we signed is a basket deal. Later, we will select specific projects and negotiate on particular details and conditions. In fact, the debate ahead of the prime minister’s visit was driven by whether to take loans or grants from China. That was wrong. It is rather a project-based approach. On certain projects, we need all grants while on certain others, we may jointly develop them. Still in other projects, we have to seek concessional loans. All these things depend on what project we are talking about. If a project can pay back the loan, that could be dealt accordingly. But our discussions were driven by the concept of loan versus grant. Even top leaders got swayed by such narratives and reacted accordingly. China has declared huge grants to Nepal multiple times since 2016. But we haven’t been able to use them as we have to earmark the amounts and seek them. First, we have to say that we are going to use this money in these projects. We at the task force concluded that the amount of the grants pledged by China is enough for us for now. There is no need to take out a loan now. Our priority is to get the grants that have been stuck for years. Do we need to select certain projects for that?Yes, we have to first finalise the projects and prepare business plans. We can explore other options only if the grant money is insufficient for a particular project. For instance, if we start working on a cross-border railway, we would discuss whether the grant money is sufficient and whether to seek more grants or go for loans. We aren’t in that stage now. We are yet to receive the grant announced during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. Similarly, grants were announced during the China visits of then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, first President Rambaran Yadav and our prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Also, this time, the Chinese President has announced 500 million RMB in assistance. So, again, first we have to work to receive and use the grant money. For instance, recently, the Chinese side announced to provide electric vehicles worth US$10 million as support through the Chinese embassy. The EVs include public buses, ambulances and school vans but they release them only after we provide the specifications of the vehicles that we need. The amount we sign as a budgetary support can be used wherever we want but other sums are released only after we earmark them for certain projects. After a long negotiation, Nepal and China have agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’. What does that mean?During the negotiation, we had used the term ‘grant and different financing modalities’. Later, we agreed to replace the word ‘grant’ with ‘aid’. We did so as we wanted to keep the door open in terms of seeking support from a country. If we say that we won’t receive any support except grants, it creates complications in the overall investment scenario. The Chinese government may provide a certain amount of grant to the government of Nepal but it doesn’t give it to the private sector.If Nepal’s private sector plans to attract investment from China, the World Bank, the ADB or any other agencies, for example for a mega hydro project, they may not get it as the Chinese side knows that Nepal accepts only grants and no other form of investment. Such a condition creates complications as this agreement is applicable even for the private sector. Therefore, we didn’t want to close the door. We can’t say we accept loans from this country but not from the other. We accept assistance that serves our national interest.Will the negotiations now onward be project-specific then?Yes. It will be project and proposal specific. Such issues will be negotiated only when we discuss a certain project. Therefore, the ongoing debate over grants versus loan is pointless. For instance, we didn’t receive certain portions of the assistance announced by India immediately after the 2015 earthquakes. Such is also the case with China and with other countries on occasions as the conditions attached to them weren’t acceptable to us.After the failure in operating Pokhara Regional International Airport due to lack of business plans, people are now suspicious about the utilisation of any assistance fruitfully.How can you say the Pokhara airport project is a failure? First, one should study the airport’s capacity and check how many passengers are flying to Pokhara now. A good number of people are flying there. I think the interest rate on the loan we took from China to build the airport is no different to the rate we receive from the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral agencies. We can debate whether we have been able to operate the airport in its full capacity. But there is no need to scandalise it unnecessarily.Ahead of the prime minister’s visit, there were voices that Nepal should seek a waiver of Pokhara airport loan from China. What happened?Let me ask you a question. Imagine, you took a loan from Rastriya Banijya Bank to meet your needs. Say, there is a government led by a leader who favours you. Can the prime minister waive off your bank loan? No. You have to follow the system. So your question is wrong. The Pokhara airport deal is not a grant. It’s a commercial deal. Those who run the government can’t use the language of Durga Prasai, who threatens not to pay back bank loans. What are the agreements on road connectivity and cross-border railway projects?We have included five points under the infrastructure-urban development project. These are Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel, Hilsa Simkot Road Project, Kathmandu-Khandbari Road, Kimathanka Bridge, the cross-border railway project from Rasuwagadhi to Kathmandu and the Amargadhi City Hall. Likewise, we have included a cross-border transmission line to start energy trade with China. Under education and health, we agreed to establish universities and colleges. The Chinese side is carrying out a feasibility study of the railway project with a plan to complete it by 2026. Once the study is complete, we will discuss the funding modalities and business plans.What is the status of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel project?The China side is in a position to complete its feasibility study. After that, construction work will start.Nepal has signed so many agreements with China. While we have progressed a lot on paper, there is little progress on the ground. Will the present agreement make any substantive change in this connection?Nepal is behind on monitoring and follow up. We should have formed bilateral mechanisms and monitored work progress. Now, there is a sense of urgency in the government to expedite development works. An inter-agency mechanism will be formed within our government. It will monitor and facilitate the work and the line ministries will execute the plans.Why are the agreements signed with China not made public, unlike the deals inked with other countries?There is no problem in making them public because there is nothing to hide. But all agreements aren’t made public. The MCC Compact had to be taken to the parliament as people were divided over it. Then, it was publicly debated. Likewise, people are now expressing their curiosity towards the BRI documents. But there are many projects people don’t care about. When needed, the documents can be made public as nothing can be hidden these days. And there is nothing wrong in making them public.UMl’s coalition partner Congress was reportedly reluctant to sign the framework agreement. What was its concern?That is a wrong narrative. Both the UML and the Congress were on the same page. It was possible to conclude the agreements because we had consensus.But the Congress leaders expressed their concerns in public ahead of the visit and even after the signing of the deals.We have to follow the party’s official decisions, not the statements of individual leaders. How would it have been possible to reach agreements if there were differences in the two-party taskforce, in the leadership and the party’s official positions? It’s a Nepal-China agreement jointly done by the UML and the Congress, and backed by all other parties. The prime minister convened a meeting of former prime ministers and foreign ministers ahead of his visit. All of them advised the prime minister to sign the agreement with China. Why was the signing of the agreement delayed?While signing a bilateral agreement, we can’t think only from our perspective. Negotiation always takes long. The joint statement has stated that the two sides are ready to sign the BRI framework as soon as possible. It took time for us to share the documents with the Chinese side after we reached Beijing. It’s not like two leaders just sit, discuss and sign on that. They have to consult concerned ministries, departments and officials. The Chinese worked overnight after we submitted the documents. My impression is that the Chinese side showed magnanimity and adopted a short-cut approach and signed on the deals. They were ready to sign the agreements on our conditions. That was a wonderful gesture.What were the specific points of contention and how were they resolved?We substantially edited the documents that were exchanged in the past, making them more specific and converting them into a framework of cooperation. Therefore, the Chinese side needed at least a day to study them. They argued that it would work even without mentioning the word ‘grant’. In view of the narratives in Nepal, we proposed to use ‘grant’ or a word with similar meaning. Then, we proposed ‘aid assistance financing’, and they accepted the term.How will the new deal be implemented?There used to be confusion about whether a certain project is under the BRI. China said even the Pokhara airport project is under the BRI while we said it was initiated before that. Now onward, all projects with China will be under the BRI cooperation. All the financing and investments from China will enter Nepal through the BRI window. We will prioritise the projects already proposed and under study such as the railway project, Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, and Madan Bhandari University. We have agreed to strengthen connectivity on border points and work will be expedited there. That will help transform Nepal from a land-locked into a land-linked country.Why are the projects being developed with Chinese involvement so slow?These days the Chinese side tells us to give projects only after clearing the sites. For instance, the 17-km Syafrubeshi-Rasuwagadhi road is to be built by Chinese grants. There is one transmission pole standing in the way. We are yet to remove it from the construction site. They haven’t started the work citing the same reason. Creating an environment to work on the field is our responsibility. It’s not that only China-built projects are slow. Such is also the story with our projects with other countries and agencies. Even in the case of the MCC projects, it took a long time to finalise many issues. We are too slow in implementing agreements and executing projects. First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  ","summary":"Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned home on December 5 after a four-day official visit to China.

First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  "},{"hash":"6aefa87c5372da415729ba34119f452b28f118961283653d01b79fc38080bcb7","title":"rather-than-a-bridge-nepal-should-try-to-develop-as-a-port","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/12/02/rather-than-a-bridge-nepal-should-try-to-develop-as-a-port","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/interviews/Chinesemain-1733100908.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1733097600000,"source":"kp","category":"interviews","content":"Wang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best.

He said his family migrates every year to escape the harsh winter. On Saturday, approximately three feet of snow accumulated in his village.Similarly, Tshering Tamang from ward 6 of Namkha Rural Municipality in Humla moved to Surkhet with his six-member family in mid-November. Tamang trades sheep wool and handmade goods during the winter. “With the area receiving heavy snowfall since Friday evening, we won’t return to the village until the snow in the Nara and Nyalu areas melts,” Tamang said, adding that snow has blocked access to their village.This year, Mugu and Humla have already experienced snowfall three times. Many villages, including Chitai, Dolphu, Kimri, Takha, and Khari in Mugum Karmarong, have been emptied as locals migrate to warmer regions for nearly six months yearly.Public offices, schools, health posts, and police stations are non-operational due to the extreme cold, according to Tshering Kyapne Lama, chair of Mugum Karmarong Rural Municipality.“Development works remain suspended for six months, and most of the budget is spent hurriedly in the last months of the fiscal year,” Lama said. He said that the rural municipality has allocated Rs320 million for the current fiscal year.In the past three years, nearly Rs120 million has gone unspent, according to the municipality’s data. Although funds have been allocated for around 150 projects this year, no development expenditure has been made so far.In Humla, the Hilsa border point with China has also been closed due to snowfall. Chief District Officer Narayan Pandey said the area is covered by three feet of snow, leaving only a few people to guard and take care of the hotels, which have largely remained empty. Security personnel from Nepal Police and the Armed Police Force continue to guard the region.“Some schools in the upper regions are also closed, and the villages are deserted,” he said. “As of Saturday evening, snowfall continued, with up to one foot of snow in the areas surrounding the district headquarters. While the snowfall has made life difficult, farmers are happy as it will help their crops grow.”Pandey said that air services have been disrupted in the mountainous districts of Karnali, including Humla, since Saturday due to the heavy snow. Locals are staying indoors, keeping warm by the fire, and he noted that it would take at least a week for the situation to return to normal.While locals endure harsh indoor conditions, farmers remain optimistic about improved agricultural yields. Prem Bahadur Rokaya from ward 7 of Simkot Rural Municipality said sufficient snowfall benefits water sources and improves crop health. “Snowfall prevents pests and ensures better barley, wheat, millet, and buckwheat harvests,” Rokaya said, adding that adequate snow replenishes streams and springs throughout the year.Tourist destinations such as Rara Lake and Shey Phoksundo Lake have also experienced their third snowfall of the season. Mahesh Neupane, senior conservation officer at Rara National Park, said the snow has enhanced the area’s beauty, raising hopes for a boost in tourism. “The snowfall will also benefit apple and crop production in the region,” Neupane said.Similarly, Nurendra Aryal, senior conservation officer at Shey Phoksundo National Park, stated that the snow has made Phoksundo Lake even more picturesque, attracting tourists.

Many villages, including Chitai, Dolphu, Kimri, Takha, and Khari in Mugum Karmarong, have been emptied as locals migrate to warmer regions for nearly six months yearly.Public offices, schools, health posts, and police stations are non-operational due to the extreme cold, according to Tshering Kyapne Lama, chair of Mugum Karmarong Rural Municipality.“Development works remain suspended for six months, and most of the budget is spent hurriedly in the last months of the fiscal year,” Lama said. He said that the rural municipality has allocated Rs320 million for the current fiscal year.In the past three years, nearly Rs120 million has gone unspent, according to the municipality’s data. Although funds have been allocated for around 150 projects this year, no development expenditure has been made so far.In Humla, the Hilsa border point with China has also been closed due to snowfall. Chief District Officer Narayan Pandey said the area is covered by three feet of snow, leaving only a few people to guard and take care of the hotels, which have largely remained empty. Security personnel from Nepal Police and the Armed Police Force continue to guard the region.“Some schools in the upper regions are also closed, and the villages are deserted,” he said. “As of Saturday evening, snowfall continued, with up to one foot of snow in the areas surrounding the district headquarters. While the snowfall has made life difficult, farmers are happy as it will help their crops grow.”Pandey said that air services have been disrupted in the mountainous districts of Karnali, including Humla, since Saturday due to the heavy snow. Locals are staying indoors, keeping warm by the fire, and he noted that it would take at least a week for the situation to return to normal.While locals endure harsh indoor conditions, farmers remain optimistic about improved agricultural yields. Prem Bahadur Rokaya from ward 7 of Simkot Rural Municipality said sufficient snowfall benefits water sources and improves crop health. “Snowfall prevents pests and ensures better barley, wheat, millet, and buckwheat harvests,” Rokaya said, adding that adequate snow replenishes streams and springs throughout the year.Tourist destinations such as Rara Lake and Shey Phoksundo Lake have also experienced their third snowfall of the season. Mahesh Neupane, senior conservation officer at Rara National Park, said the snow has enhanced the area’s beauty, raising hopes for a boost in tourism. “The snowfall will also benefit apple and crop production in the region,” Neupane said.Similarly, Nurendra Aryal, senior conservation officer at Shey Phoksundo National Park, stated that the snow has made Phoksundo Lake even more picturesque, attracting tourists.
