We have been struggling to trace the source of infection.”Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites. Infected female Anopheles mosquitoes carry these deadly parasites, according to the World Health Organisation. Nepal had initially committed to achieving ‘malaria-free’ status by 2026. For this, the country needs to bring down indigenous cases or local transmission to zero, achieve zero deaths starting from 2023, and maintain zero indigenous cases for three consecutive years.However, the country has failed to bring down indigenous cases to zero in both 2023 and 2024.Instead, cases of infections–both Indigenous and imported have risen alarmingly, which shattered any prospects of eliminating the disease within the deadline.Health officials say that only 16 cases of local transmission or indigenous cases were confirmed in 2023. But in 2024, more than 20 cases have been reported. Compared to 649 imported cases in 2023, the country witnessed nearly 1,000 such cases in 2024.Indigenous malaria cases are locally transmitted, meaning the infected person does not have a history of travel to a malaria-affected country. Officials say that the isolated indigenous cases of malaria infection are such cases that they do not have a history of travelling to the disease-endemic areas.“Neither the people of the community and family have been infected, nor the infected persons have a history of travelling to disease-hit areas,” said Dahal. “We have stepped up surveillance measures to trace the source of infection.”Officials attribute that the disease might remain asymptomatic for a long time in the infected person and emerge as single isolated cases or may have been contracted within the country in areas not considered endemic.Officials further added that open borders, budget cuts in the health sector, and mosquitoes moving to higher altitudes due to climate change have hindered Nepal’s malaria elimination goal.They say that of the total imported cases, over 80 percent came from India. Some cases were imported from African countries. Nepali security personnel serving in UN peacekeeping missions in conflict-hit African countries also often get tested positive for malaria.Officials say the disease is unlikely to be eliminated in Nepal unless India eradicates it first. They say that due to proximity, and an open and porous border between Nepal and India and unregulated travel of people of both countries, it is impossible to eliminate malaria in Nepal, until the disease gets eradicated in the southern neighbour.Several other factors, including cuts in the health budgets by government and aid agencies and shifts in vectors transmitting malaria to the hills and mountains due to global warming, also pose serious challenges to meeting the elimination target. Apart from this, most health facilities across the country lack entomologists necessary for conducting surveillance. Malaria-related deaths had stopped since 2016, but five years later, in 2021, the country recorded one death from the disease.Officials at the health ministry said that until recent years, Plasmodium Vivax, a protozoan parasite, had been responsible for most of the malaria cases in the country, which caused relatively less severe diseases. However, cases of Plasmodium falciparum, which most often cause severe and life-threatening malaria, have been rising. The parasite is common in many countries in Africa and the Sahara desert.

Since then, voices have again grown to probe Nepali Congress Vice-president Dhan Raj Gurung, too, for his alleged involvement in the misuse of cooperatives funds.Dhan Raj Gurung and his former wife, Jyoti, allegedly embezzled funds from Miteri Cooperative in Lalitpur. In suspicion of Jyoti fleeing the country, the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of the Nepal Police in October recommended the police headquarters issue an Interpol Red notice against her. Then, the Interpol issued the notice against Jyoti Gurung and Jyoti Bahadur Bhandari in the second week of November.The parliamentary special probe committee, formed on May 28 to investigate the crisis-ridden cooperatives under the leadership of CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa, instructed in its report submitted to the Speaker of the House of Representatives in September to investigate Dhan Raj Gurung along with his former wife for their alleged involvement in embezzling cooperatives funds.RSP members, among others, argue that the authorities were not investigating Congress leader Gurung even as they have been prosecuting Lamichhane on the basis of the recommendation by the same report.However, Congress Chief Whip, Shyam Kumar Ghimire, claimed that his party’s vice-president Gurung has not been prosecuted because it was his former wife, Jyoti, who misappropriated Miteri Cooperative funds, and not Dhan Raj himself. Even if they had not been divorced, there is no law requiring the husband to be investigated for the fraud committed by the wife, Ghimire claimed.Many people have accused the authorities of sparing Dhan Raj due to pressure from the ruling party. After the police arrested RSP President Lamichhane accusing him of misusing cooperative funds, RSP leaders have accused the government of pursuing him in a political witch hunt.But Congress leaders refute the allegations saying that there was no pressure at all from the party not to investigate Gurung.“Our party has not pressured the law enforcement agencies at all not to investigate party vice-president Gurung,” Ghimire said. “Gurung has not been investigated because he is not involved in any wrongdoing.”Ghimire also argued that the accusations against RSP chair Lamichhane and the Congress vice-president are quite different. Lamichhane is accused of defrauding the cooperatives, while Gurung is linked to the case because of the involvement of his former wife. Though there has been an investigation on Congress vice-chair Gururng as per the recommendation of the parliamentary special probe committee’s report, police have not yet found his involvement in the misuse of cooperatives funds, says CIB spokesperson Hobindra Bogati.Police interrogated Congress leader Gurung for about four-and-a-half hours on November 13 in suspicion of his involvement in the cooperatives scam. He has denied the allegations. “Without any connection, police cannot declare anyone guilty. As far as our investigation shows, Dhan Raj Gurung has not been found guilty in the scam,” Bogati said. “We have already issued a Red notice against his former wife, Jyoti, and the police are using the diplomatic channel to bring her back.”Bogati claimed that whether the party is in the government or not does not make any difference in their investigation.Kumbharaj Gurung, chairman of Miteri Cooperative, filed a complaint at the Department of Cooperatives in August, alleging that Jyoti Gurung, the then general manager of the cooperative had embezzled millions of rupees from the cooperative. He also accused Congress Vice-president Dhan Raj of being involved in the financial transactions.Jyoti, the former wife of Congress leader Dhan Raj, joined the cooperative as a clerk on May 25, 2000. Within two months, she was promoted to accountant and became the general manager in 2018.After becoming the general manager, Jyoti allegedly transferred the cooperative’s funds to the name of Jyoti Bahadur Bhandari. Initially, Jyoti Gurung is found to have withdrawn Rs3 million from the cooperative and loaned it to Bhandari for a week. Bhandari returned the amount, topping it up by half a million rupees.Then Bhandari again took out another loan worth Rs4 million. This time, Bhandari returned the money next week, paying Rs1 million extra. Jyoti Gurung profited by misappropriating the cooperative’s funds to lend at exorbitant interest rates, calculated weekly.Later, Bhandari ran away with the money given by Jyoti Gurung. Congress leader Dhan Raj Gurung is accused of divorcing his wife only on paper after his wife’s business became unmanageable.Khumbharaj Gurung, the cooperative chairman, claimed that Dhan Raj took out a loan from the cooperative, with Jyoti Gurung as witness, even after their ‘paper divorce’. “Dhan Raj Gurung claims to have divorced Jyoti only to evade his obligations,” Khumbharaj told the Post.“Despite repaying the loan in their names, Gurung and his former wife will have to repay the money they misused from the cooperative. They have misused Rs140.81 million,” chairman Khumbharaj Gurung says.Congress leader Gurung has denied his involvement in the scam arguing that he can’t be held responsible for the misappropriation of money by his former wife with whom he no longer has any relationship.Although Dhanraj Gurung claims that he separated himself from his wife in 2019, Miteri Cooperative chair Kumbharaj told law enforcement agencies that the lawmaker continued to pay off the debts in his wife’s name until last year.He gave the same statements to the parliamentary probe committee.Various copies of deposit vouchers Dhan Raj Gurung reportedly used to pay back the cooperative loan have surfaced on various media outlets.After being accused of embezzling the cooperative’s funds, Dhan Raj on September 10 spoke in Parliament and demanded a proper investigation on the “false allegations” against him.The parliamentary committee formed to investigate the crisis-ridden cooperatives that submitted its report in September, however, suggested the law enforcement probe Congress leader Gurung as well.  ","summary":"As police continue probing Rastriya Swatantra Party President and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane by keeping him in custody for over two months over his alleged involvement in cooperatives fraud case, RSP leaders and sympathisers have been consistently raising questions over the impartiality of investigation.“Why has the government not investigated Congress leader Dhan Raj Gurung and UML leader Rishikesh Pokharel even as they are linked to cooperatives scams?” This is a common refrain from RSP leaders, of late.They accuse the ruling parties of protecting leaders close to them while targeting opposition leaders and carrying out investigations in a selective approach.On December 17, the Morang District Court issued arrest warrants against 25 people, including Anjala Koirala, wife of parliament’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) chair and UML leader Rishikesh Pokharel, in connection with alleged financial irregularities in the Uma-Gauri Agricultural Cooperatives.

Then, the Interpol issued the notice against Jyoti Gurung and Jyoti Bahadur Bhandari in the second week of November.The parliamentary special probe committee, formed on May 28 to investigate the crisis-ridden cooperatives under the leadership of CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa, instructed in its report submitted to the Speaker of the House of Representatives in September to investigate Dhan Raj Gurung along with his former wife for their alleged involvement in embezzling cooperatives funds.RSP members, among others, argue that the authorities were not investigating Congress leader Gurung even as they have been prosecuting Lamichhane on the basis of the recommendation by the same report.However, Congress Chief Whip, Shyam Kumar Ghimire, claimed that his party’s vice-president Gurung has not been prosecuted because it was his former wife, Jyoti, who misappropriated Miteri Cooperative funds, and not Dhan Raj himself. Even if they had not been divorced, there is no law requiring the husband to be investigated for the fraud committed by the wife, Ghimire claimed.Many people have accused the authorities of sparing Dhan Raj due to pressure from the ruling party. After the police arrested RSP President Lamichhane accusing him of misusing cooperative funds, RSP leaders have accused the government of pursuing him in a political witch hunt.But Congress leaders refute the allegations saying that there was no pressure at all from the party not to investigate Gurung.“Our party has not pressured the law enforcement agencies at all not to investigate party vice-president Gurung,” Ghimire said. “Gurung has not been investigated because he is not involved in any wrongdoing.”Ghimire also argued that the accusations against RSP chair Lamichhane and the Congress vice-president are quite different. Lamichhane is accused of defrauding the cooperatives, while Gurung is linked to the case because of the involvement of his former wife. Though there has been an investigation on Congress vice-chair Gururng as per the recommendation of the parliamentary special probe committee’s report, police have not yet found his involvement in the misuse of cooperatives funds, says CIB spokesperson Hobindra Bogati.Police interrogated Congress leader Gurung for about four-and-a-half hours on November 13 in suspicion of his involvement in the cooperatives scam. He has denied the allegations. “Without any connection, police cannot declare anyone guilty. As far as our investigation shows, Dhan Raj Gurung has not been found guilty in the scam,” Bogati said. “We have already issued a Red notice against his former wife, Jyoti, and the police are using the diplomatic channel to bring her back.”Bogati claimed that whether the party is in the government or not does not make any difference in their investigation.Kumbharaj Gurung, chairman of Miteri Cooperative, filed a complaint at the Department of Cooperatives in August, alleging that Jyoti Gurung, the then general manager of the cooperative had embezzled millions of rupees from the cooperative. He also accused Congress Vice-president Dhan Raj of being involved in the financial transactions.Jyoti, the former wife of Congress leader Dhan Raj, joined the cooperative as a clerk on May 25, 2000. Within two months, she was promoted to accountant and became the general manager in 2018.After becoming the general manager, Jyoti allegedly transferred the cooperative’s funds to the name of Jyoti Bahadur Bhandari. Initially, Jyoti Gurung is found to have withdrawn Rs3 million from the cooperative and loaned it to Bhandari for a week. Bhandari returned the amount, topping it up by half a million rupees.Then Bhandari again took out another loan worth Rs4 million. This time, Bhandari returned the money next week, paying Rs1 million extra. Jyoti Gurung profited by misappropriating the cooperative’s funds to lend at exorbitant interest rates, calculated weekly.Later, Bhandari ran away with the money given by Jyoti Gurung. Congress leader Dhan Raj Gurung is accused of divorcing his wife only on paper after his wife’s business became unmanageable.Khumbharaj Gurung, the cooperative chairman, claimed that Dhan Raj took out a loan from the cooperative, with Jyoti Gurung as witness, even after their ‘paper divorce’. “Dhan Raj Gurung claims to have divorced Jyoti only to evade his obligations,” Khumbharaj told the Post.“Despite repaying the loan in their names, Gurung and his former wife will have to repay the money they misused from the cooperative. They have misused Rs140.81 million,” chairman Khumbharaj Gurung says.Congress leader Gurung has denied his involvement in the scam arguing that he can’t be held responsible for the misappropriation of money by his former wife with whom he no longer has any relationship.Although Dhanraj Gurung claims that he separated himself from his wife in 2019, Miteri Cooperative chair Kumbharaj told law enforcement agencies that the lawmaker continued to pay off the debts in his wife’s name until last year.He gave the same statements to the parliamentary probe committee.Various copies of deposit vouchers Dhan Raj Gurung reportedly used to pay back the cooperative loan have surfaced on various media outlets.After being accused of embezzling the cooperative’s funds, Dhan Raj on September 10 spoke in Parliament and demanded a proper investigation on the “false allegations” against him.The parliamentary committee formed to investigate the crisis-ridden cooperatives that submitted its report in September, however, suggested the law enforcement probe Congress leader Gurung as well.  "},{"hash":"31eb91a52c0a28608134f9e0e973a0f281825c3b11d2af095241778a76b6790b","title":"janakpur-bolts-secure-spot-in-npl-final-set-to-face-sudurpaschim-royals","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/cricket/2024/12/19/janakpur-bolts-secure-spot-in-npl-final-set-to-face-sudurpaschim-royals","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/sports/jankapur191220241121061000x0-1734604846.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1734566400000,"source":"kp","category":"cricket","content":"Janakpur Bolts defeated Karnali Yaks by two wickets in a low-scoring Qualifier 2 match at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, securing their place in the final of the Nepal Premier League (NPL) 2024.

The state-owned DDC will supply 1,000 kgs of raw cheese or whey made from 10,000 litres of milk daily to Himalayan Dog Chew, owned by Manaram Group, a key exporter of the hardened cheese.Whey is the liquid remaining after milk has been curdled and strained. It is used to make Chhurpi.The agreement was signed between Surya Prasad Paudel, general manager of the DDC, and Poonam Karki, chief financial officer of Manaram Group, on Wednesday. “We will supply whey for a year and renew the agreement next year,” said Paudel.Manaram Group has been exporting 100 tonnes of dog chew a month under the ‘Himalayan Dog Chew’ brand in the US market. The chew is produced in its plant in Godak, Ilam.Chhurpi, a traditional product of the highlands, is a protein-rich cheese with a smoky flavour and hard consistency that becomes chewier the longer one gnaws at it.This solid snack's uniquely challenging texture has been a favourite for decades for the people of eastern Nepal, eastern India, and Bhutan.

The DDC currently collects raw milk from farmers at Rs65 per litre. Paudel said there will be no milk holiday in eastern Nepal, at least now, due to the agreement.He said that supplying 10,000 litres of milk to a single company, however, will not create shortages in the market.According to the DDC, the Biratnagar Milk Supply Scheme collects 15,000 litres daily. “We will now have to increase the collection gradually to 25,000 litres,” said Paudel.DDC buys 120,000 million litres of milk from farmers nationwide, worth Rs7.9 million daily, or around Rs230 million monthly.Manaram Group, the renowned exporter of dog chew, has been collecting 6,000 litres of milk from nearby districts and producing dog chew at the Ilam plant. As the collection of milk is insufficient, the group buys dog chews from small dairy farmers in Dhankuta, Sankhuwasabha, Ilam, Panchthar and Taplejung districts.The demand for dog chew has been growing in overseas markets, particularly in the US, Canada and the UK, with more and more people there owning pets.The shipment of dog chew from Nepal increased 17.6 percent to Rs1.02 billion in the first four months of the current fiscal year until mid-November, compared to the same period last fiscal, according to the Trade and Export Promotion Centre.Of the Rs1.15 billion, Rs1.02 billion worth of dog chew was exported to the United States, Rs77.29 million to Canada and Rs19.57 million to the United Kingdom.

His tango with Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba seems to be proceeding well. Over the last few months, the top leaders of Nepal’s two major political parties have been excessively focused on not offending each other, as doing so could tip the balance.Since this new coalition was formed without a clear vision, it failed to inspire confidence from the outset. Hence, on the delivery front, the Oli administration was bound to fail.The CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress decided to join forces with the promise of amending the constitution to ensure political stability. Over the past months, the two parties have offered numerous reasons for forming the coalition, but none involve the constitutional amendment issue, as if it has vanished from their agenda.Neither party has provided answers about the amendment process, likely because they don’t have one.While an amendment to the constitution is not inherently problematic, there must be a clear rationale. The justification the two parties offered was so flimsy that it was evident from the start that their amendment rhetoric was just a ruse. Even if they are committed to their promise, it remains a misguided priority. The need of the hour is addressing more urgent matters, such as good governance and service delivery, which are directly linked to citizens.Misplaced priorityNepal’s major political parties—the NC, the UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre)—seem to have little confidence in the constitution they once championed through majoritarian dominance. Dissenting voices were ignored, suppressed and silenced.They once called it the world’s best but are now finding fault with it—not because it has caused problems for the people but because it obstructs their pursuit of majority governments. At least, this has been the argument of the UML and the Congress of late because they are the largest parties and are aiming for a majority in the next elections. Nevertheless, once promulgated, it was incumbent upon Nepali parties to focus on full implementation of the constitution. This required following due processes—enacting laws, devolving power and strengthening institutions. However, none of the parties paid attention to these fundamentals. Instead, they treated the constitution as a tool to “rule” when the charter required them to “govern.”Post-2015, Nepali parties had only two key responsibilities—governance and constitution implementation. They failed on both fronts, especially because they were excessively involved in the game of one-upmanship. These key duties were thus relegated to the back burner.Spirit of the constitutionA pluralist, inclusive, progressive and peaceful society was the core idea of the constitution. But this very spirit is under threat from the parties that are supposed to safeguard it, as they have failed to internalise the concept of constitutionalism in its true sense.Nepali politicians often cite the holding of two sets of national, provincial and local elections within the prescribed timeframe and the formation of governments to argue that democracy is functioning in Nepal. While this reasoning has merit, democracy’s full functionality depends on its realisation at the grassroots and among the people.True upholding of constitutionalism means abiding by its principles, respecting its limitations and adhering to the rule of law. Only then can the pluralistic, inclusive and progressive society envisioned by the constitution be built.Stable and accountable governance entails adherence to the rule of law, the protection of individual rights and the separation of powers.But questions remain: Have successive governments, regardless of which parties or leaders led them, fully complied with the laws? Has the system of checks and balances been allowed to operate fully in both letter and spirit?Constitutional moralityTrue implementation of the constitution depends on constitutionalism, which itself is rooted in constitutional morality—embracing not just legal provisions but also the underlying democratic values of justice, equality and respect for individual rights. Unfortunately, this idea—that the constitution is not just a guidebook setting the rules but a moral document—is sorely lacking among Nepali parties and politicians.The waning morality among Nepali parties has emerged as a troubling trend. Their pursuit of power and self-interest takes precedence over addressing citizens’ concerns. Since the UML and the Congress—historically rival parties—formed the new coalition, they have started floating the idea of a two-party system. While this notion is unlikely to materialise anytime soon, it does indicate their broader aim. Beneath the veneer of their argument for stability through a two-party system lies a dangerous intent to muzzle multi-party democracy, one of the basic tenets of the constitution, and to rule in turns.Coupled with this is yet another worrying concern: Internal democracy has been on the wane within Nepali political parties. Majoritarianism rules the roost in major parties, raising the risk that the same approach will manifest when they come to power. Democracy thrives when institutions are strong, but they have been weakened by the parties’ disregard for the separation of powers. Weak institutions, a lack of morality and an utter disregard for the rule of law create the perfect conditions for majoritarian tendencies to rear their ugly head.‘We, the People’The most worrying issue today is that political parties do not want to confront the most pressing issues of the day, which actually concern the people.While they harp on the constitution—and even warn that the statute is under threat—they ignore the fact that it will continue to face risks as long as they fail to ensure that the spirit of the charter resonates with ordinary people.The worry today is not just that Nepali parties are falling short on the delivery front; it is that the gains made so far could be in danger.The incumbent UML-Congress coalition, if genuinely committed to the welfare of ordinary citizens, must pause and reassess its priorities. Their survival and political relevance depend on embracing the politics of citizenry and addressing the pressing needs of the people they are meant to serve.Lest they forget, the ultimate power rests with “We, the People,” as the constitution declares.

His tango with Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba seems to be proceeding well. Over the last few months, the top leaders of Nepal’s two major political parties have been excessively focused on not offending each other, as doing so could tip the balance.Since this new coalition was formed without a clear vision, it failed to inspire confidence from the outset. Hence, on the delivery front, the Oli administration was bound to fail.The CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress decided to join forces with the promise of amending the constitution to ensure political stability. Over the past months, the two parties have offered numerous reasons for forming the coalition, but none involve the constitutional amendment issue, as if it has vanished from their agenda.Neither party has provided answers about the amendment process, likely because they don’t have one.While an amendment to the constitution is not inherently problematic, there must be a clear rationale. The justification the two parties offered was so flimsy that it was evident from the start that their amendment rhetoric was just a ruse. Even if they are committed to their promise, it remains a misguided priority. The need of the hour is addressing more urgent matters, such as good governance and service delivery, which are directly linked to citizens.Misplaced priorityNepal’s major political parties—the NC, the UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre)—seem to have little confidence in the constitution they once championed through majoritarian dominance. Dissenting voices were ignored, suppressed and silenced.They once called it the world’s best but are now finding fault with it—not because it has caused problems for the people but because it obstructs their pursuit of majority governments. At least, this has been the argument of the UML and the Congress of late because they are the largest parties and are aiming for a majority in the next elections. Nevertheless, once promulgated, it was incumbent upon Nepali parties to focus on full implementation of the constitution. This required following due processes—enacting laws, devolving power and strengthening institutions. However, none of the parties paid attention to these fundamentals. Instead, they treated the constitution as a tool to “rule” when the charter required them to “govern.”Post-2015, Nepali parties had only two key responsibilities—governance and constitution implementation. They failed on both fronts, especially because they were excessively involved in the game of one-upmanship. These key duties were thus relegated to the back burner.Spirit of the constitutionA pluralist, inclusive, progressive and peaceful society was the core idea of the constitution. But this very spirit is under threat from the parties that are supposed to safeguard it, as they have failed to internalise the concept of constitutionalism in its true sense.Nepali politicians often cite the holding of two sets of national, provincial and local elections within the prescribed timeframe and the formation of governments to argue that democracy is functioning in Nepal. While this reasoning has merit, democracy’s full functionality depends on its realisation at the grassroots and among the people.True upholding of constitutionalism means abiding by its principles, respecting its limitations and adhering to the rule of law. Only then can the pluralistic, inclusive and progressive society envisioned by the constitution be built.Stable and accountable governance entails adherence to the rule of law, the protection of individual rights and the separation of powers.But questions remain: Have successive governments, regardless of which parties or leaders led them, fully complied with the laws? Has the system of checks and balances been allowed to operate fully in both letter and spirit?Constitutional moralityTrue implementation of the constitution depends on constitutionalism, which itself is rooted in constitutional morality—embracing not just legal provisions but also the underlying democratic values of justice, equality and respect for individual rights. Unfortunately, this idea—that the constitution is not just a guidebook setting the rules but a moral document—is sorely lacking among Nepali parties and politicians.The waning morality among Nepali parties has emerged as a troubling trend. Their pursuit of power and self-interest takes precedence over addressing citizens’ concerns. Since the UML and the Congress—historically rival parties—formed the new coalition, they have started floating the idea of a two-party system. While this notion is unlikely to materialise anytime soon, it does indicate their broader aim. Beneath the veneer of their argument for stability through a two-party system lies a dangerous intent to muzzle multi-party democracy, one of the basic tenets of the constitution, and to rule in turns.Coupled with this is yet another worrying concern: Internal democracy has been on the wane within Nepali political parties. Majoritarianism rules the roost in major parties, raising the risk that the same approach will manifest when they come to power. Democracy thrives when institutions are strong, but they have been weakened by the parties’ disregard for the separation of powers. Weak institutions, a lack of morality and an utter disregard for the rule of law create the perfect conditions for majoritarian tendencies to rear their ugly head.‘We, the People’The most worrying issue today is that political parties do not want to confront the most pressing issues of the day, which actually concern the people.While they harp on the constitution—and even warn that the statute is under threat—they ignore the fact that it will continue to face risks as long as they fail to ensure that the spirit of the charter resonates with ordinary people.The worry today is not just that Nepali parties are falling short on the delivery front; it is that the gains made so far could be in danger.The incumbent UML-Congress coalition, if genuinely committed to the welfare of ordinary citizens, must pause and reassess its priorities. Their survival and political relevance depend on embracing the politics of citizenry and addressing the pressing needs of the people they are meant to serve.Lest they forget, the ultimate power rests with “We, the People,” as the constitution declares.

The circulation of newspapers in India seems to have stagnated in relation to population growth, meaning the proportion of people reading printed news has dropped. More readers are turning to free online news sources and circulation growth is failing to keep up with demographic expansion. Given India’s vast population—nearly 10 times that of Japan—it is concerning that India has only as many newspapers with over a million in circulation as Japan.If this decline in print journalism is not addressed, it could as well pose a serious threat to the fundamental values of our democracy. The potential consequences of this decline are too grave to ignore. There is no such thing as free news, just as there is no such thing as a free lunch. Free online news is not truly free; it comes with hidden costs, such as algorithms similar to those on social media—that prioritise sensationalist stories, fuelling misinformation and polarisation. ‘Brain rot’, named Oxford Word of the Year 2024, is defined as “the supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging.” The usage of the word saw an increase of 230 percent in its frequency from 2023 to 2024. Oxford University Press’s announcement of the Word of the Year sparked debate about the potential negative impact of excessive online content consumption on mental health, particularly in children and young people. According to Newport Institute in the US, one brain rot behaviour is doom scrolling, involving long periods of searching for negative and distressing news online; and consequences include difficulty organising information, solving problems, making decisions, and recalling information. The Institute advises, “Don’t succumb to sensationalistic and negative news. Diversify your media sources so you maintain a more balanced world perspective.” Unlike online outlets focused on short, click-driven pieces, print newspapers offer curated in-depth coverage of current events. The details that could be captured by such reporting are things the small articles or social media posts dominating the digital landscape will never be able to capture. Printed newspapers have kept high editorial standards and leave a permanent record that is also transparent. Digital stories, by contrast, can be edited, removed or simply lost. In an era where fake news spreads rapidly on social media, print newspapers remain a trusted source of verified information. Japan’s strong newspaper circulation demonstrates the enduring value of print media. Leading dailies like Yomiuri Shimbun and Asahi Shimbun sell millions of daily copies. This cultural preference for physical newspapers is reflected in the popularity of newspaper clubs, found in schools, universities and community centres. By discussing and analysing news stories, members of these clubs develop deep appreciation for journalism and learn to be active, responsible citizens, which is crucial for a healthy democracy. Commonly, online news platforms use algorithms that only feed the users news they are already interested in, reducing exposure to a broader range of information. This trend undermines the financial viability of traditional media while promoting a media landscape dominated by clickbait reporting. Ironically, when print newspapers disappear, the future of online news is also at stake. The sustainability of digital journalism depends on the investigative and qualitative reporting that traditional print media does. Without print outlets holding power to account and investing in journalism, the quality of online news could significantly decline, littered with sensationalism and disinformation. Australia has recognised this challenge and taken bold initiatives to protect journalism. In 2021, Australia introduced the Treasury Laws Amendment (News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code) Act 2021 a world-first legislation aimed at helping to sustain public interest journalism. The law requires tech giants like Google and Facebook to pay news organisations for sharing their content. Australia’s success motivated other nations: Canada and Indonesia are planning similar codes. During his National Press Day address, Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting Ashwini Vaishnaw remarked that traditional content must be fairly compensated to preserve its value.

It is believed to be one major factor discouraging investors, innovators, entrepreneurs, as well as service seekers. But following tremendous pressure from various sections of the society, government authorities have initiated investigations on some major corruption cases. The fake Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Tribhuvan University land encroachment, gold smuggling and cooperatives deposits embezzlement are cases that have been probed. Even high profile personalities such as a former Speaker, former ministers, top bureaucrats and powerful middlemen have been prosecuted.Currently, the embezzlement of billions of rupees deposited by thousands of people at hundreds of cooperatives across the country remains a hotly-debated issue. Politicians, a former top police official, and key officials running dozens of cooperatives are being investigated. Police have issued red corner notices against those who are on the run after embezzling deposits from various cooperatives. The Rastriya Swatantra Party chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane, among other suspects, has been in custody for the past two months over his alleged involvement in the embezzlement. But other politicians and individuals close to top political leaders have been spared, it is alleged, under political pressure. Just like Lamichhane, Nepali Congress Vice-President and lawmaker Dhan Raj Gurung, and federal parliament’s Public Accounts Committee chair Rishikesh Pokharel of the CPN-UML have been linked to the cases of embezzlement of funds from different cooperatives. Yet they were not being probed. Thankfully, there has been a breakthrough. The Morang District Court on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant against 25 suspects including Anjala Koirala, wife of PAC chair Pokharel, in connection with alleged financial irregularities in Uma-Gauri Agricultural Cooperative. Yet little seems to be happening in the case against Gurung. The Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police had in October recommended the police headquarter issue a red notice against Gurung’s former wife Jyoti, among others, on charges of embezzling cooperative deposits. Though Dhan Raj and Jyoti officially appear to have divorced, it seems the two were still jointly misusing funds even after the formal divorce. Also, the cross-party Parliamentary Special Probe Committee has suggested the authorities investigate the Congress leader’s involvement.When it comes to past investigations in major corruption scandals, the results have been mixed. The investigation agencies have produced some laudable results in a few cases, while they were criticised in other scams for sparing politicians while punishing civil servants and other individuals. So people still doubt their role. Many people believe investigating agencies, under pressure from influential leaders, first spare the politicians and their kin or, even if they are arrested, the cases against them are watered down to help the suspects get clean chit. Though cases were filed against high profile individuals in the fake refugee case, Lalita Niwas and gold smuggling scams, many of them have already been acquitted. People are thus rightly suspicious. To remove their doubts, first, the agencies should show the courage to work independently and stop waiting for signals from top politicians. Or the flawed justice process will backfire on the top politicians too. If the public comes to see that only those without access to power centres get punished while those close to top politicians and other power centres are spared, their faith in the country’s legal process will erode. So will their trust in the political parties. Now that investigation has started against the spouse of an UML leader, there should now be no delay in probing the Congress leader too.   ","summary":"Corruption ails almost every sector in Nepal.

A prior bipartisan deal was scuttled after Trump and the world’s richest person Elon Musk came out against it on Wednesday.Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson provided no details when reporters asked him about next steps after the failed vote.“We will come up with another solution,” he said.Government funding is due to expire at midnight on Friday. If lawmakers fail to extend that deadline, the US government will begin a partial shutdown that would interrupt funding for everything from border enforcement to national parks and cut off paychecks for more than 2 million federal workers. The US Transportation Security Administration warned that travelers during the busy holiday season could face long lines at airports.The bill that failed on Thursday largely resembled the earlier version that Musk and Trump had blasted as a wasteful giveaway to Democrats. It would have extended government funding into March and provided $100 billion in disaster relief and suspended the debt. Republicans dropped other elements that had been included in the original package, such as a pay raise for lawmakers and new rules for pharmacy benefit managers.At Trump’s urging, the new version also would have suspended limits on the national debt for two years — a maneuver that would make it easier to pass the dramatic tax cuts he has promised.Johnson before the vote told reporters that the package would avoid disruption, tie up loose ends and make it easier for lawmakers to cut spending by hundreds of billions of dollars when Trump takes office next year.“Government is too big, it does too many things, and it does few things well,” he said.TEEING UP TAX CUTDemocrats blasted the bill as a cover for a budget-busting tax cut that would largely benefit wealthy backers such as Musk, the world’s richest person, while saddling the country with trillions of dollars in additional debt.“How dare you lecture America about fiscal responsibility, ever?” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said during floor debate.Even if the bill had passed the House, it would have faced long odds in the Senate, which is currently controlled by Democrats. The White House said Democratic President Joe Biden did not support it.Previous fights over the debt ceiling have spooked financial markets, as a U.S. government default would send credit shocks around the world. The limit has been suspended under an agreement that technically expires on Jan. 1, though lawmakers likely will not have to tackle the issue before the spring.When he returns to office, Trump aims to enact tax cuts that could reduce revenues by $8 trillion over 10 years, which would drive the debt higher without offsetting spending cuts. He has vowed not to reduce retirement and health benefits for seniors that make up a vast chunk of the budget and are projected to grow dramatically in the years to come.The last government shutdown, opens new tab took place in December 2018 and January 2019 during Trump’s first White House term.The unrest also threatened to topple Johnson, a mild-mannered Louisianan who was thrust unexpectedly into the speaker’s office last year after the party’s right flank voted out then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy over a government funding bill.

The commission is the focal agency in China, tasked with the development of BRI projects.The framework will be valid for three years and will get another three-year extension unless terminated by either side.Speaking briefly from Beijing with the Post, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba said that the framework signed on Wednesday is not new. “It should be understood as a continuation of the memorandum of understanding signed in 2017,” she added.A joint task force of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the two largest parties and ruling partners, in Kathmandu had tweaked the original BRI implementation plan proposed by the Chinese side in 2020.Wednesday’s development formally endorses Nepal’s involvement in the BRI, a programme China proposed and Nepal initially signed in 2017. But negotiations on the projects under the BRI could still prove difficult in the future.‘Aid financing modalities’, as have been agreed under the new framework, have elements of both grant and loan, said one Nepali official who is a part of Oli’s delegation in Beijing.“Even as we signed the framework, we were clear that we cannot accept projects under the BRI with interest rates exceeding those charged by bilateral and multilateral donors,” the official said. “Our focus would be on seeking grants and concessional loans in line with the interest rates offered by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other bilateral and multilateral agencies.”Wednesday’s agreement paves the way for negotiations on the ten projects that Nepal had proposed to China.“Today, we signed the Framework for Belt and Road Cooperation,” Prime Minister Oli wrote in his X account. “I am honoured to reflect on the bilateral talks with Premier Li Qiang, discussions with National People’s Congress of China Chairman Zhao Leji and the highly fruitful meeting with President Xi Jinping.”The economic cooperation between Nepal and China will further strengthen under the Belt and Road Framework Cooperation, writes Oli.Just ahead of the prime minister’s departure for Beijing on Monday, the Nepali side had sent a new version of the framework for BRI cooperation and insisted on grants as the project financing model. But the Chinese side objected to the words and replaced them with ‘assistance financing’ and sent the document back to the Nepali side for consideration.“Then we sat again, spoke with the prime minister and proposed a middle path using the phrase ‘aid financing’ as a modality,” one Nepali member of the delegation told the Post from Beijing over the phone. “The Chinese took some time to consider our proposal. Therefore, the new BRI framework is missing in the joint communiqué released late Tuesday. Eventually, both parties agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’ and the agreement was signed on Wednesday.” On Nepal’s side, the negotiations were led by Prime Minister Oli’s economic and development adviser Yubaraj Khatiwada, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and Acting Foreign Secretary Rai. High-ranking foreign ministry officials represented the Chinese delegation.As Nepal and China are in different stages of development, projects will be selected on the basis of Nepal’s specific requirements and needs. During project negotiation, the final BRI framework agreement states, both sides should uphold the principle of technical, financial, commercial and economic viability and value for money. Likewise, both sides will work to create a conducive business environment.The ‘Objective’ of the BRI framework cooperation states that both sides should facilitate the financial and technical cooperation for each project, and they identified the areas of cooperation—economic development, financial sector cooperation, transport, connectivity and logistic cooperation, trade industrial capacity and investment cooperation, and customs clearance—according to another member of the Nepali delegation who is in Beijing.Nepal has proposed ten different projects to be executed under the BRI. They are Tokha-Chhahare tunnel road, Hilsa-Simikot road project, Kimathanka-Khandbari road and bridge, Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu cross-border railway, Amargadhi City Hall in Dadeldhura, Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime 220KV transmission line, Madan Bhandari University, Kathmandu Scientific Centre and Science Museum, China-Nepal friendship industrial park in Damak and Jhapa sports and athletic complex.Nepal will set priorities and prepare the implementation plan for each of these projects. The Nepali side, in the negotiation phase, had changed several proposals.The Nepali side significantly shortened the list of priority areas originally proposed by the Chinese side in early 2020 which included construction of the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network, including ports, roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, aviation infrastructure, telecom projects, electricity transmission line, carrying out the China-Nepal cross-border railway project.Similarly, the two sides will develop implementation plans for energy related projects, cooperation in the field of e-commerce and trade and industrial capacity enhancement, building trade infrastructures, adopting trade and investment liberalisation, and expanding bilateral economic relationship.The BRI framework provides significant impetus for a stronger economic and project development partnership between the two countries, said Semanta Dahal, who was part of the task force that revised the BRI framework on behalf of the ruling coalition in a capacity of legal adviser. He added that it addresses ambiguities surrounding the infrastructure projects to be implemented under the BRI in Nepal and establishes clear negotiation principles, including the use of aid financing.“This will facilitate negotiations on a project-by-project basis and ensure that infrastructure and connectivity projects offer value for money,” he said.

The charges were based on allegations that Sharma was part of a conspiracy to bribe Nepali officials to secure two Airbus A330 deals in 2017.Sharma pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit around $130,000. His sentences are yet to be determined, so this case is ongoing.Sharma, a Nepal-born British citizen, joined AAR in 2015. Before this, he was the chief technical officer at AJW Group, which he joined in 2008. He has also been the engineering director at UK International Airlines.According to the documents in this case obtained by the Post, between November 2015 and August 2018, Sharma conspired with others to pay bribes to Nepali officials to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft on behalf of AAR Corp to Nepal Airlines Corporation.On June 24, 2024, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma—as an agent for AAR—conspired to bribe Nepali officials and filed a single count of information under seal in the District of Columbia, alleging a conspiracy to violate the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions.In July, guilty pleas were publicly revealed, five years after AAR disclosed possible FCPA violations. The court unsealed the case on August 1, 2024, in connection with a plea agreement.In December 2016, Nepal Airlines selected a group consisting of AAR Corp, German Aviation Capital, and Hi Fly (airline) of Portugal to purchase two widebody aircraft. The month before, according to the investigation transcript, Sharma sent a text message to a conspirator, stating: “I am having dinner with the head of the evaluation committee now. We are discussing how to throw others out even if they come below our bid. See you tomorrow.”In an Information filed, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma, on behalf of AAR, agreed to bribe Nepali officials to manipulate the deal in favour of AAR and a German aircraft leasing and trading company, working with a Nepali intermediary and an unnamed co-conspirator [a director of an affiliate of the German company] to facilitate a sham transaction between the German aircraft company and Nepal Airlines.The Information describes Sharma’s email and text communications, as well as invoices and wire transfer records, which record payments made by the German company's Ireland-based Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to a United Arab Emirates-based bank account used by the Nepali intermediary to fund bribes to Nepali officials. In Nepal, on April 4, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), the constitutional anti-graft body, completed its five-year probe into the Airbus deal, concluding that procuring two wide-body Airbus A330 jets caused a loss of Rs1.47 billion ($13.38 million) to the government.The loss was computed based on the exchange rate at the time of the last instalment payment in 2018.The CIAA filed a case against 32 individuals at the Special Court for their alleged corruption in the deal, commonly known as the ‘wide-body scam’. The court is expected to issue a verdict within this month.The first of the two wide-body aircraft, Annapurna, arrived at the Tribhuvan International Airport in June 2018. The second, Makalu, came a month later.In a statement, the commission said it had filed the case against a former minister, high-level sitting and retired government officials, private sector representatives, and aircraft suppliers.The accused are former tourism minister Jeevan Bahadur Shahi, former managing director of Nepal Airlines Sugat Ratna Kansakar, former tourism secretary Shankar Adhikari and former finance secretary Shishir Kumar Dhungana.At the time of the deal, Adhikari and Dhungana were on the board of the national flag carrier.In charging documents filed in the US court, Sharma is described as an “agent” of Company 1 (a reference to AAR).“It was the purpose of the conspiracy for Sharma and his co-conspirators to illegally benefit Company 1, Subsidiary 1 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], and others by bribing Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1 [a Nepali citizen who served as a high-level official at Nepal Airlines Corporation from at least approximately 2015 through 2019] in order to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft to the state-owned national carrier.”Sharma and his co-conspirators made and received wire transfers intended, in part, as bribes for Nepali officials in connection with Nepal Airlines Corporation transactions, using bank accounts in the United States, Ireland, and the United Arab Emirates, among other places.Sharma and his co-conspirators attempted to disguise the wire transfers as legitimate business transactions by entering into sham agreements between Subsidiary 2 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], Company 2 [an aircraft leasing and trading company based in Germany], and Company 3 [a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Ireland and managed by Company 2] on the one hand, and Companies 4 [a Hong Kong incorporated company used by Intermediary] and 5 [a United Arab Emirates incorporated company used by Intermediary] on the other. Some payments were made under sham invoices sent by Sharma and his co-conspirators from Companies 4 and 5 and directed to Company 3. The invoices falsely referred to the bribe payments as “advances”.“In total, between in or around May and August 2018, Company 3 paid Company 5 the equivalent of approximately $2,500,000 in connection with Nepal Airlines transaction, a portion of which Sharma understood would be distributed as bribes to Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1.”On or about March 29, 2016, approximately six months before Nepal Airlines publicly issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the purchase of two A330s, Sharma forwarded an email to two executives at Company 1 containing a draft RFP that was circulated among Nepal Airlines Corporation officials, including Foreign Official 1. In his email to the two executives at Company 1, Sharma stated, “Please find attached Draft RFP[.] NOTE: [T]his [is] not published yet, and it is strictly for three of us [a Company 1 executive], you and I, to comment and change any terms to suit [Company 1].

Yet, we are trapped in a vicious cycle of low growth and high migration. When the Constitution was finally promulgated two decades after the launch of the Maoist People’s War, we expected politics to be our salvation. Unfortunately, it has become our prison.Nepal's low-growth, high-migration trap isn't just an economic phenomenon—it's a political protection mechanism that preserves an unsustainable kleptocracy and crony capitalism. While the World Bank calls for a “systematic assault” on economic barriers, what Nepal needs is a paradigm shift that will fundamentally transform power relations and dismantle extractive networks.Without such a shift, emerging political agency and a growing structural crisis will create a rupture. The absence of comprehensive political and economic reforms is a matter of serious concern for Nepalis. It does not just affect our graduation to a middle-income status, which has already been pushed behind schedule; it also impacts the lives of millions of people and determines Nepal’s development trajectory.The trapSince the World Bank's initial analysis in 2017, Nepal's “low-growth, high-migration trap” has deepened. According to the World Bank, low-growth fails to generate employment. As a result, a large number of youth are forced to migrate. Migration brings in remittance, enabling consumption but no productive investment. High remittance not only creates economic distortions, but also reduces pressure on the top leaders to deliver reforms. The lack of reforms, in turn, reinforces low growth.Despite poverty reduction, Nepal has been growing at only about 4 percent, marginally better than the 2 percent growth achieved in 2023. At this rate, Nepal will be unable to graduate from LDC at least until 2030.Nepal’s economic trends and fiscal positions are becoming increasingly unsustainable, creating pressures for change. For example, budget execution rates are below 80 percent, revenue collection is dwindling, capital expenditure is low, and the debt service burden is rising.While the per capita income remains at around $1,400, limiting job creation, the manufacturing sector’s GDP share has shrunk by half since 2008. While migration is increasing, fiscal indicators are worsening. Our dependence on migration is growing. While public debt is about 44 percent of the GDP, our revenues are shrinking. Debt servicing and financial management consume almost 20 percent of the budget, while development expenditure has shrunk to 19 percent and is poorly executed.Political agencyThe kleptocracy, patronised by top political leaders, extracts power and money from the people and the state. In doing so, they misuse state power, distort its bodies and hollow out legal institutions. Despite this, political agency has failed to drive change.Institutions like the World Bank have been advocating comprehensive reforms. For example, they want to break policy barriers, build new growth sources, revitalise agriculture, address migration issues and unleash financial reforms. These reforms would make the economy more competitive, productive and broad-based. All of these recommendations directly impact the existing extractive system dominated by crony capitalism, kleptocracy and political parties. Initiating changes would mean changing the status quo, which is why these suggestions fail.The failure of new parties to put pressure on traditional parties has not helped. When the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) emerged just before the 2022 elections, it was largely driven by the aspirations of migrant workers. However, the ethical dilemma posed by evidence of corruption of RSP’s founder has dented the party’s aspirations. When the current coalition was forged, one of the objectives was to deliver results to the people to show them that there was no need for new parties. This strategy has failed. However, the new parties have met the same fate, ultimately benefiting the entrenched leaders. One of the results of this mismatch between people’s expectations and political delivery is the reluctance of people to identify themselves with a political party. Rather, the disenchantment and dissatisfaction echo in social media in fragmented ways. Activism has not worked because people have become distrustful of not only political parties but also activists who claim to represent civil society.Incremental reforms?There are enough people who believe that incremental reforms in the economy will add up and drive change. Some people are also hopeful that the traditional parties are feeling the pressure and will reform, albeit slowly. Then there are others who think we must seek alternatives to the current political system. Many of them tout China as a model of growth and aspire to have “political stability.”None of these approaches will work, unfortunately.Traditional solutions offered by donors and development partners often fail because they cannot address political-economy factors and political dynamics. These solutions focus on the symptoms rather than the root causes. Incremental reforms are often absorbed by the system, with all its deformities. And when the reforms are significant, the kleptocracy swiftly neutralises the attempts.For a few years, the traditional political parties could create the illusion of change, but all that the superficial democracy did was maintain the status quo. The current political system is rooted in extractive kleptocracy because the parties need each other to survive. Reforms will undermine the sources of political power and wealth. Therefore, political reform is impossible without disrupting the existing political power models.The current political malaise has discredited the whole democratic system. Seeking an alternative to the democratic system, however, is not an option. According to renowned economists, democracies perform at least 20 percent better than non-democracies in delivering prosperity. Democracies can also deliver more investment, economic reforms and public goods.A likely ruptureYes, the emergence of new political forces has faltered. Yet, this is only a temporary blip. At least four quarters are pressing for transformation in our political and economic system: the migrant population, urban youth, a traditionalist nationalist force allied with the former monarchy and a liberal-minded civil society. Even if political agency and social movements have failed to produce well-thought-out political movements, structural factors will continue to push for change because the status quo is untenable, and it is little prepared for shocks that may come from unexpected quarters.New structural pressures are building: Demographic transition creates new demands, digital transformation rearranges political psychology and regional economic integration forces competitiveness. Demographic pressures, economic vulnerabilities, migration impacts and urbanisation pressures will continue to generate strain until the status quo breaks.Our hope is that political agency and the structural crisis will align so that we are able to manage the transformation in a meaningful way. Otherwise, instability and chaos will become unavoidable. ","summary":"Nepal has almost everything it needs for prosperity: A strategic location, tourism potential, hydropower and a young population. Yet, we are trapped in a vicious cycle of low growth and high migration. When the Constitution was finally promulgated two decades after the launch of the Maoist People’s War, we expected politics to be our salvation.

However, the exact figures of the agreement have not been disclosed.Eight franchise teams—Biratnagar Kings, Chitwan Rhinos, Janakpur Bolts, Karnali Yaks, Kathmandu Gurkhas, Lumbini Lions, Pokhara Avengers and Sudurpaschim Royals—collectively spent more than Rs50 million rupees in the auction.

We met at his regular spot, RoadHouse in Pulchowk, for a 30-minute conversation. Even though it was short, it was effective.Sayami has directed six feature-length films, contributing significantly to the industry. He has also authored eleven Nepali and English books in cinema and music. In this chat with the Post’s Aarya Chand, Sayami discusses his journey from writing love letters to becoming an author, creating films, and the challenges for creative artists.What inspired you to write, and how has your journey as an author evolved?My writing journey is shaped by meaningful life experiences, mostly positive ones. It all started with writing love letters, but as time passed, I moved towards literature.I began writing during my school years, and one of my short stories was even featured on Radio Nepal's ‘Bal Karyakram’ programme.You’ve worked in FM Radio for a long time. How do you view the role of radio in promoting literature and culture in Nepal? Can it be an effective medium for reviving interest in Nepali literature, especially among the youth?FM serves three primary purposes: to educate, inform, and entertain. When all three are mixed, confusion results, which is what seems to be happening in the field today. However, FM can still be effective for promoting literature if it focuses on activities like book recitations and essay readings. Although it’s not legally allowed, it could function with proper permission. What themes or ideas do you feel are left unexplored in your writing? I want to write a travelogue that captures the essence of the places I visit—the architecture, the emotions they evoke, the sounds I hear, the statues in museums, and my realisations—rather than focusing on chronological details. I also aspire to write my autobiography, but the idea feels frightening because it demands absolute truth. As the popular saying goes, ‘Of all that is written, an autobiography can only be written when a man pours his blood from his heart.’This level of honesty feels risky, especially when considering real-life examples like Harivansh Rai Bachchan, the renowned Indian poet and writer celebrated for his role in the Nayi Kavita movement in Hindi literature. His four-volume autobiography strained his family relationships, much like Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk, who explored Turkish identity in his works. Pamuk’s depiction of personal and family experiences in ‘İstanbul: Memories and the City’ caused a rift with his mother, who stopped speaking to him. Such examples highlight why I often feel writing can be an unsocial profession.How would you convince a reader unfamiliar with Narayan Gopal to read your book, ‘Swarsamrat Narayan Gopal’?I wrote this book mainly for the younger generation, as many are unfamiliar with Narayan Gopal, and even some contemporary singers know very little about him. In the book, I’ve tried to portray not just the black-and-white aspects of his life but also the grey areas, highlighting his immense potential. Many songs we hear today might be copies of his originals, so why not appreciate the authentic ones? I also wanted to shed light on the struggles one endures to become a singer.How do you balance writing for artistic expression with meeting the demands of commercial appeal, especially in the context of films and literature?I have written for many commercial movies. Rajesh Hamal’s iconic, “Saathiharu ko lagi yo hath salam ho, dushman haru ko lagi yo hath falam ho,” was said in one of my films.My film features the famous song ‘Ukali Orali Gardai’, which marked Indian singer Sonu Nigam’s debut in Nepali cinema. I also introduced artists like Jal Shah and Miss Nepal Jharna Bajracharya through my projects.As you mentioned, writing for movies and literature are two distinct forms of expression. Film is mass media, appealing to a broad audience, even those unfamiliar with the context, while literature is targeted media. However, both require the same dedication. As the saying goes, ‘Either you go down or bring the reader up.’ As writers, it should be our responsibility to strive for that connection and uplift our audience.Prakash Sayami’s book recommendationsAbstract Chintan PyajAuthor: Shankar Lamichhane Publisher: Sajha Prakashan Year: 1967 Lamichhane’s experimental book inspired me despite its challenging essay format.

As the popular saying goes, ‘Of all that is written, an autobiography can only be written when a man pours his blood from his heart.’This level of honesty feels risky, especially when considering real-life examples like Harivansh Rai Bachchan, the renowned Indian poet and writer celebrated for his role in the Nayi Kavita movement in Hindi literature. His four-volume autobiography strained his family relationships, much like Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk, who explored Turkish identity in his works. Pamuk’s depiction of personal and family experiences in ‘İstanbul: Memories and the City’ caused a rift with his mother, who stopped speaking to him. Such examples highlight why I often feel writing can be an unsocial profession.How would you convince a reader unfamiliar with Narayan Gopal to read your book, ‘Swarsamrat Narayan Gopal’?I wrote this book mainly for the younger generation, as many are unfamiliar with Narayan Gopal, and even some contemporary singers know very little about him. In the book, I’ve tried to portray not just the black-and-white aspects of his life but also the grey areas, highlighting his immense potential. Many songs we hear today might be copies of his originals, so why not appreciate the authentic ones? I also wanted to shed light on the struggles one endures to become a singer.How do you balance writing for artistic expression with meeting the demands of commercial appeal, especially in the context of films and literature?I have written for many commercial movies. Rajesh Hamal’s iconic, “Saathiharu ko lagi yo hath salam ho, dushman haru ko lagi yo hath falam ho,” was said in one of my films.My film features the famous song ‘Ukali Orali Gardai’, which marked Indian singer Sonu Nigam’s debut in Nepali cinema. I also introduced artists like Jal Shah and Miss Nepal Jharna Bajracharya through my projects.As you mentioned, writing for movies and literature are two distinct forms of expression. Film is mass media, appealing to a broad audience, even those unfamiliar with the context, while literature is targeted media. However, both require the same dedication. As the saying goes, ‘Either you go down or bring the reader up.’ As writers, it should be our responsibility to strive for that connection and uplift our audience.Prakash Sayami’s book recommendationsAbstract Chintan PyajAuthor: Shankar Lamichhane Publisher: Sajha Prakashan Year: 1967 Lamichhane’s experimental book inspired me despite its challenging essay format.

The workshop aimed to make the party organisation more dynamic and connect with the people.Aiming to give the party decisive political power, it has also announced a three-month campaign at the ward level starting on January 16.The workshop concluded that although UML hopes to become the largest party through the 2027 elections, the party committees, in their current form, were ineffective and not well-positioned to achieve that goal. The workshop also decided to intensify the organisation-strengthening campaign.All these moves indicate that the UML is currently more focussed on the 2027 elections than on governing.Political historian Rajesh Gautam finds it unnatural that instead of focusing on delivery and addressing the growing public disenchantment towards political parties, the ruling political party is focusing on the next election.“What makes one believe that political parties that have failed to deliver good governance at present will do so after the next election?” Gautam questions.Gautam stressed that since political parties do not have a specific plan and vision, they are making lofty plans to engage their cadres.The UML came in second in the local and federal elections held in 2022. For a brief time, the party was also in the government led by CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, formed soon after the November 2022 federal and provincial elections.However, when the Maoist Centre changed its coalition partner, joining hands with the Nepali Congress, the UML was relegated to the opposition party at both the federal and provincial governments. But the party got back in power on March 4, first collaborating with the Maoist Centre as a coalition partner and later with Congress, following the July 1 midnight agreement.Whether in the government or the opposition, the UML’s focus appears to lie on the upcoming election.Chandra Dev Bhatta, a political analyst, says that a political party focusing on the upcoming election should be taken as natural; it is their long-term political plan.“Since the election result 2022 delivered a hung Parliament, no political party can single-handedly lead the government now,” Bhatta said. “Political parties are focussing on the upcoming election to avoid that situation.”After the UML realised that its strength was diminishing after conducting the mid-hill highway-centric political campaign last year, it is now giving its full attention to strengthening its party organisation, Bhatta said. The party had expected a positive result in the just-concluded local-level by-election; however, the result was contrary to its expectations, which forced it to focus rigorously on the upcoming election.“But it is not only the UML that is concentrating on the next election,” Bhatta added. “Other major political parties like Congress and Maoist Centre are also organising various programmes aimed at the next election.”The UML had launched a mid-hill highway-centric political campaign in December last year, aiming to interact with the local communities in 26 districts connected by the highway. UML then organised 30 mass assemblies and interacted with locals through over 100 gatherings during the two-week-long tour.The campaign, which started in Jhulaghat of Baitadi on December 1, concluded 17 days later when it reached Chiwabhanjyang in the far-eastern part of the country.Before this, in February 2023, UML also organised a ‘Mission Grassroots’ campaign to strengthen the party's ideological organisation, which was also focused on the next election.

Internal Affairs and Law Minister Rewati Raman Bhandari and Minister for Physical Infrastructure Development Bhupendra Rai are its members while the secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Law serves as its member-secretary.A provincial assembly meeting had named Province 1 as Koshi on March 1 last year. The name, proposed by the CPN-UML, was endorsed by an overwhelming majority, with assembly members from the Nepali Congress, the CPN (Maoist Centre), and the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) voting in its favour.But the nomenclature did not sit well with various ethnic groups that had been demanding the province be named after the ethnic identity of the dominant communities residing in the province. The groups then took to the streets against the nomenclature.Amid this, on December 8, members of the struggle committee tried to show a black flag, as a symbolic protest, to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli while he was visiting his home district of Jhapa.Minister for Internal Affairs and Law Bhandari said that there are various issues related to community, identity and ethnicity that have emerged in the province and may arise in the future as well. “The dialogue committee will find solutions to these issues through negotiations in line with the constitution and laws,” he said.The dialogue team has yet to start its work. As Sunday is a public holiday, the committee is likely to hold a formal meeting with the agitating groups on Monday, Bhandari said.“We can talk jointly or separately with different groups—it will be determined by the terms of reference (ToR) that our committee formulates,” Minister Bhandari added. “At present, at least eight to nine groups are protesting by taking up identity issues.”The agitating groups have also been demanding that Maithili be designated the official language of the province, Minister Bhandari said.But Govinda Chhantyal, an identity-based rights activist, differs with the minister. “The identity movement has been raising the issue of language long before the issue of naming the Koshi emerged,” he said.“While the government recognised 12 official languages, Limbu and Maithili were recognised as the official languages ​​of Koshi Province,” Chhantyal added. “We have since then been linking the language issue with the identity movement.”In 2021, the language commission submitted its report to then President Bidya Devi Bhandari and then Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, recommending 12 languages, including Nepali, as official languages.Koshi Provincial Assembly member from Nepali Congress Shamsher Rai emphasises the importance of resolving outstanding issues through dialogue. The previous government held talks with the agitating groups twice. Although the talks had progressed positively, the change of government at the centre and the province later affected them, Rai said.“Both sides should opt for dialogue,” Rai said.Prem Yakten, coordinator of the struggle committee accused the current provincial government of ignoring the problem.“If the government ignores our movement, we will intensify it in other provinces too,” coordinator Yatken said. “The main agenda of our protest is to rename the Koshi Province.”Soon after the provincial assembly named the province as Koshi, the agitating groups started disruptive activities. Authorities had to announce prohibitory orders in the province for a few days.Upon reaching an agreement on February 9 with the Kedar Karki-led government, the agitating groups had halted their protests. They later contested in the subsequent by-election held in Ilam-2.In the April by-election held to elect a federal lawmaker from Ilam-2, two activists of the Province-1 Renaming Joint Struggle Committee—Dakendra Limbu and Milan Limbu—contested the seats. Dakendra fought as an independent candidate while Milan contested as a candidate from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). Dakendra secured third position with 11,457 votes; CPN-UML’s Suhang Nemwang, the son of former Speaker late Subas Nembang, won the election.“The by-election held earlier this year boosted our confidence and the election result justified our movement,” Yakten said.“We had reached a five-point agreement with the Kedar Karki-led government,” Yakten said. “The government’s dialogue committee had then agreed to take political initiatives to resolve the issue of renaming the Koshi Province.” According to him, the provincial government had agreed to fund the treatment of those injured during the agitation and compensate the families of those who died in it.“The government committee had vowed to start the process of releasing those in prison and withdrawing cases of those charged of vandalism,” Yakten said. “But none of the agreements were implemented, compelling us to hit the street again.”Yakten says that they have come up with an alternative name for the province.“Earlier, supporters of identity-based nomenclature had suggested alternate names for the Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province as well but they were ignored,” Yakten added. “Even now, they accuse us of not having an alternative name. We have it but we won’t make it public until the government is ready to change the name.” ","summary":"As various ethnic groups raising their voice for identity-based nomenclature of Koshi Province prepare to resume their agitation, the provincial government is considering holding talks with them.The provincial government has formed a talks team weeks after the groups dissatisfied with the province’s nomenclature announced a ‘new and decisive’ agitation.On November 18, the Province 1 Renaming Joint Struggle Committee had held a press conference to announce the movement.Nearly a month later, on Thursday, the provincial government formed a three-member dialogue committee led by Minister for Economic Affairs and Planning Ram Bahadur Magar.

Dakendra secured third position with 11,457 votes; CPN-UML’s Suhang Nemwang, the son of former Speaker late Subas Nembang, won the election.“The by-election held earlier this year boosted our confidence and the election result justified our movement,” Yakten said.“We had reached a five-point agreement with the Kedar Karki-led government,” Yakten said. “The government’s dialogue committee had then agreed to take political initiatives to resolve the issue of renaming the Koshi Province.” According to him, the provincial government had agreed to fund the treatment of those injured during the agitation and compensate the families of those who died in it.“The government committee had vowed to start the process of releasing those in prison and withdrawing cases of those charged of vandalism,” Yakten said. “But none of the agreements were implemented, compelling us to hit the street again.”Yakten says that they have come up with an alternative name for the province.“Earlier, supporters of identity-based nomenclature had suggested alternate names for the Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province as well but they were ignored,” Yakten added. “Even now, they accuse us of not having an alternative name. We have it but we won’t make it public until the government is ready to change the name.” "},{"hash":"cabfbf8ef4a87cc9c16cad326236e746d5ee381793b25326e1f76831137f7ca0","title":"oli-s-china-deal-copy-paste-of-the-pact-i-had-finalised-dahal","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/12/14/oli-s-china-deal-copy-paste-of-the-pact-i-had-finalised-dahal","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/maoist131220240727481000x0-1734139235.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1734134400000,"source":"kp","category":"politics","content":"The CPN (Maoist Centre) has concluded that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s China visit was a failure as he could do nothing other than sign the agreement that was readied by the erstwhile government led by party chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal.Addressing the party’s standing committee meeting on Friday, Dahal said that the Framework for Belt and Road Cooperation signed during Oli’s visit is nothing new. It was planned during his prime ministership and Oli just formalised it through the agreement.“The framework is a cut and paste of the document finalised during my prime ministership,” Ganesh Shah, the party’s secretary, quoted Dahal as saying at the meeting. “Oli couldn’t make any breakthrough during the China visit.”No party leaders questioned Dahal’s statement.The leader of the opposition had made a similar claim while addressing the party’s mass meeting in his hometown of Chitwan on Tuesday. He had claimed that Oli had been circulating the photocopies of the agreement signed during Dahal’s China visit. Dahal last visited China in September last year. After multiple rounds of negotiations, Nepal and China on December 4 signed the 10-point framework for BRI cooperation, opening doors for Chinese funds for developing projects under the BRI. The funding modalities, however, will be negotiated for each project individually. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already made public the agreement undersigned by acting Foreign Secretary Amrit Bahadur Rai and deputy head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission Liu Sushe on behalf of the respective countries. The commission is the focal agency in China, tasked with the development of BRI projects.Neither Dahal nor other party leaders, however, were critical of the agreement. There was a common opinion that the signing of the framework could open the doors for the country’s development, according to leaders present at the meeting.The standing committee meeting called to finalise the agenda for the party's central committee meet slated to kick off on Tuesday ended up postponing the meet.“The central committee meeting has been deferred till January 5, 2025 due to lack of preparation,” said the party’s spokesperson Agni Sapkota. “A standing committee meeting will be held for three days starting January 2 to finalise the agenda for the central committee meeting.”The Maoist Centre is negotiating with some parties including the one led by Netra Bikram Chand for a possible merger. Dahal believes there will be some concrete progress in the merger by January 5. “In the central committee meeting, the chairman was to give a message that the party is consolidating its strength by uniting with Chand and others,” said a leader. There is a possibility that former vice-president Nanda Bahadur Pun will be given some party role—possibly vice-chair—at the upcoming central committee meeting. Pun, who has started attending the Maoist Centre’s office-bearer meetings, however, was absent from the Friday meeting.Talking to media after the meeting, Sapkota said the outcome of the recent local level bypolls has foiled the attempts of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML to lead the country towards a two-party system. The Maoist Centre had won 11 out of 42 seats where the by-elections were held. Elated by the results, Dahal is preparing to present it as an indication of his party gaining ground and erosion of people’s trust towards the Congress and the UML, during the party’s central committee meeting. “The by-election results also indicate people’s increasing dissatisfaction and anger at the Congress-UML government,” said Sapkota, while making the meeting’s decisions public.In the meeting, the party leadership also decided to intervene in the leadership selection in its wing All Nepal National Independent Student Union (Revolutionary). Concluding that the union failed to hold its general convention, the party decided to pick the leadership while also imposing an age bar for student politics. After several postponements, the national jamboree of the union started in September. However, it was suspended without electing the leadership following a dispute over the selection of convention representatives and whether or not to set an age bar for the leadership. The convention that was scheduled to kick off on December 8 was postponed by the Maoist Centre’s standing committee meeting on December 5. “The party will intervene and select a new leadership in the student wing. An age bar—possibly of 30 years—will also be enforced,” a party leader told the Post. For years, the Maoist Centre’s leadership has directly picked leaders of its student wing. A group of student leaders led by vice-chair Keshab Rawal has been opposing the party’s regular interference in the union, saying, “It (the party leadership) thinks the students are its slaves and abide by whatever decision it makes.” Rawal, who had once staged a hunger strike demanding union’s general convention, has threatened a fresh protest against the party’s decision.

HPV can cause cervical cancer, which is a major killer of Nepali women. The vaccine will be given to girls aged 10-14 in two doses, 12 months apart. The vaccine is very effective in preventing cervical cancer, and Nepal hopes to reduce the number of cases and deaths from this disease.","summary":"Nepal has decided to include human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in its routine immunisation programme.With the inclusion of the HPV vaccine, the number of antigens provided to children under routine immunisation will reach 14.“Based on the recommendation of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, we have decided to include the HPV vaccine in the routine immunisation programme,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services. “Around 350,000 girls aged 10 years will be administered the HPV vaccine at their schools across the country.”Human papillomavirus is a viral infection that spreads through skin contact and is a major cause of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is the second-most common cancer in the developing world and a major cause of death among Nepali women. It is estimated that hundreds of women get diagnosed with cervical cancer in Nepal every year.According to the BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital in Bharatpur, more than 700 women suffering from cervical cancer seek treatment at the hospital every year.Experts say early treatment can prevent up to 80 percent of cervical cancer cases.Countries like Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives have introduced HPV vaccines nationally, while India and Indonesia have introduced them in some districts.In 2016, Nepal piloted HPV vaccines in Chitwan and Kaski districts. During the pilot, all girls aged between 11 and 13 years were given two doses of the vaccine.Last year, the country purchased 20,000 doses of the HPV vaccine and administered it to around 9,000 girls aged between 14 and 15 years in all seven provinces. Health authorities administered the vaccines at schools after other measures failed to increase the vaccine’s uptake.Doctors say most cases of cervical cancer are linked to HPV, and widespread immunisation could significantly reduce the impact of cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers worldwide.The Ministry of Health and Population has been preparing to launch a nationwide HPV vaccination drive from February 5 next year.During the nationwide campaign, over 1.68 million girls between 10 and 14 years will be administered the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine.“All eligible girls aged between 10 and 14 years will be vaccinated during the campaign,” said Gautam. “The vaccine will be administered in two doses over 12 months, with one dose given at the start and the other after 12 months.”The Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI) will supply doses of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine soon and has also provided for the campaign’s operation cost, officials say.Nepal has to cover a certain percentage of the cost of the vaccine once it is included in the regular immunisation list, officials say.Gautam said that routine immunisation will start only after the completion of the vaccination drive. The Nepal government and the GAVI will co-finance the vaccine cost of routine immunisation.Childhood immunisation is the government’s number one priority. Under this, 13 types of antigens are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid, free of cost.“The number of antigens in routine immunisation will reach 14 once the HPV vaccine is started to be administered to the target group,” said Gautam.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has shown remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate, and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.The World Health Organisation says HPV vaccination is recommended as part of a coordinated strategy to prevent cervical cancer and other diseases caused by the virus.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

Out of nowhere, I messaged my friend Santona on a whim: ‘A trip to Rara’. With little hope, I awaited her reply, and I have no idea what I’d have done if she had denied it. However, just like the phrase “waiting for the nudge,” she enthusiastically agreed, and soon we roped in our friend, Nirjara.This wasn’t our first trip together—we’d ventured to Pokhara, tried bungee jumping, paragliding, and trekked trails like Khuma and Korchan since our first year of bachelor studies. My idea this time was a well-packaged tour, but plans changed, and new destinations were chosen. The pristine Tilicho Lake became our goal. Without overthinking, I agreed; after all, it’s Nepal and here, no matter where you decide to trek, you’ll experience heaven.From Kathmandu to Manang: Green Lake and apple delightsTravelling to Manang was a meditative experience in itself. As a scout exploring different parts of Nepal, I had often embraced the rush of adventure. But here, by the serene Green Lake under the sun's warm glow, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment: ‘We’ve finally made it—without getting lost and in the right place.’ We clicked photos, laughed, and even made some silly TikTok videos. The famous apple farms of Manang called out to us with their irresistible offer: a feast of apples for just Rs200. If you’re travelling here, catching the early bus ensures Manang’s charm unfolds entirely by the end of the day.Khangsar to Tilicho Base Camp: rocks and rantsAn early morning jeep ride brought us to Khangsar. The trek was said to take 5-6 hours, but once we started, I moved ahead of my friends, a habit I don’t quite understand. I wondered if my friends would make it before dark. To my relief, their laughter and chatter soon filled the air, joining me.Then we set off into the landslide area, with jagged rocks above hanging like wind chimes ready to fall. We promised not to look up and remained focused on the trail. The journey was filled with everyday conversations from patriarchy to childhood TV shows, and before we knew it, the night wrapped around us as we arrived at the base camp. After some confusion over our booking, we finally settled in, ate quickly, and fell asleep. One tip: keep an eye on your things at Shrikharka—I lost my trekking poles there.Tilicho Lake: A view, a void, and acceptance Morning arrived. We emptied our room and set out, uncertain if we’d return in time and head straight to Shrikharka or stay the night again at base camp. One friend battled altitude sickness but pushed on fiercely, even bargaining for a horse ride, only to find me eventually outpacing it.As I neared the lake, the solitude and distance overwhelmed me. I called my father, who offered only a few comforting words before the line dropped. Thankfully, friends from home Nuya and Shri reached out, and I poured my thoughts to them through tears. With renewed spirit, I moved forward and finally reached a quiet pond that tricked me into thinking I’d arrived. Only after some guidance did I stand before the actual Tilicho Lake.Strangely, I felt no rush of joy. The sight was majestic, yet my reaction fell flat. I asked myself if it was okay to feel so indifferent. However, I accepted that sometimes it’s okay to feel nothing at all. A simple “I don’t know” was all the answers I needed.We had no rooms left on our last night at base camp, so we slept in a dorm, which was a cheaper and warmer option. After dinner, my friends drifted off, but I lingered by the fire, unwilling to leave its comfort. The dining hall was full of trekkers glued to their seats even after finishing their food until a friendly trek guide offered us seats. These guides, cheerful and chatty, shared fun stories and gossip.Ultimately, I want to say to all who recently went trekking, whether funded by parents or your hard-earned savings, to be proud and grateful for the opportunity to explore. And for those who couldn’t go this time, trust that your moment will come. Keep moving forward with hope, knowing that one day, your adventure awaits.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees.

Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. ","summary":"We spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” ","summary":"Chaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line.

She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina.

Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

India emerged as an important partner for Sri Lanka during the Covid-19 and post-pandemic periods when the country faced an economic crisis leading to its bankruptcy. This ultimately ended Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s presidency through a Jana Aragalaya (people's struggle). Dissanayake embodies the aspiration of the marginalised. His party, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), transformed its electoral base (which was 3 percent earlier) and secured massive votes with 160 seats—a two-thirds majority—in the 300-member Parliament. He visited India to discuss several Indian projects that are being implemented in Sri Lanka, the comprehensive economic partnership agreement that has been under discussion for several years, the Tamil issue and the larger security cooperation issue. Emphasising the futuristic relationship, during Dissayanayake’s maiden visit to Delhi, Prime Minister Modi said, “Physical, digital and energy connectivity shall be the key pillars of our partnership.”India-Sri Lanka relationsFor the past two decades, India has emphasised connectivity as a precursor to economic integration with its neighbours, including Sri Lanka. However, China’s Belt and Road Initiative projects have helped construct ports and airports and emerged as a major competition to India’s infrastructure activities. China-funded infrastructure projects and India-funded ones have significant differences. First, the public sector companies from India enter into a joint venture with such companies in the host country. Second, India-funded projects are based on the host country’s needs. They play a leading role in identifying sectors that need investment. Recently, Indian private sectors have begun investing in the neighbourhood, bringing private capital. Sri Lanka has become a destination for India’s public and private capitals. India’s line of credit is directed towards building rail networks and the energy sector, especially the Sampur solar power plant and the long-drawn project in Trincomalee, a port city on the northeast coast of Sri Lanka.The Sri Lankan president’s visit should be seen in the context of the country’s larger foreign policy framework and India’s keenness to partner in developmental sectors. Sri Lanka is in the middle of a geopolitical fulcrum of the Indian Ocean and the Indo-Pacific. As a small state, it wants to stay away from the conflicting and competitive geopolitical interests of major powers. As a dominant player in the Indian Ocean, India, like Sri Lanka, is equally apprehensive of external power’s geopolitical interests toward seeking a firm foothold in the region. It is increasingly working with other economic players like Japan to collaborate on infrastructure projects, especially in developing ports. The Chinese have had a controlling stake in the Hambantota port for 99 years as the Sri Lankan government failed to repay debt to China.Challenges of economic relationsTwo important factors that could challenge the bilateral relations between India and Sri Lanka are an agreement on the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) and the Tamil issue. Both have domestic political implications for Sri Lanka. Moreover, the JVP was opposed to them in the past. India-Sri Lanka economic relations have a baggage of politicisation. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) the two countries signed in 1998 and implemented in the year 2000 tripled the bilateral trade despite initial resistance from the business community to trade in certain commodities in which they had competitive advantages. Interestingly, 60 percent of Sri Lanka’s exports to India benefit from the FTA, while 5 percent of India’s exports to Sri Lanka use FTA’s provision to its advantage.Despite FTA’s success, negotiations on the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CEPA) took eight years. They were finally abandoned due to excessive politics and the fear of the negative implication of Indian domination of Sri Lanka’s market on certain Sri Lankan industries. The Rajapakse regime politically manipulated this opposition in their strategy to oppose India while forging close economic cooperation with China. One also saw similar opposition from the Trade Union and the JVP to the trilateral Memorandum of Consent (MoC) between India, Sri Lanka and Japan in developing the Eastern Container Terminal, which cancelled the MoC. The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna party and its new incarnation, the National People’s Power (NPP), continued opposing Indian projects in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka also cancelled the wind power project on its northern island, which China was developing due to India’s security concerns.From 2016-18, there have been 11 rounds of talks between India and Sri Lanka. These talks were revived in 2023 and included trade in goods and services. Trade in services is more politically complicated than goods. Sri Lanka has welcomed India’s investment in renewable energy, especially in the solar and wind sectors, to reduce its dependency on electricity generated by fossil fuels. The country produces electricity using imported oil and coal, constituting 20 percent and 35 percent of energy production, respectively. This makes the unit cost of energy production expensive and impacts foreign exchange reserves. India’s solar and wind energy investment would be a game changer in Sri Lanka’s energy mix. During this visit by the Sri Lankan president, the two countries also agreed to connect their electricity grid and have a multi-product petroleum pipeline.Tamil political questionUnresolved Tamil political issues have always shadowed India’s relations with Sri Lanka. The JVP, the main constituent unit of the National People’s Power party, has consistently opposed devolution. However, this time, the NPP has won 3 seats in Jaffna, the capital city of the northern province of Sri Lanka. At one point in time, Jaffna was a stronghold of the Tamil separatist group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Voice in favour of Tamil political aspiration is often raised in Jaffna, which is also the provincial capital of the Northern province. The NPP has towed the Sinhala Buddhist majoritarian line that refused to recognise devolution as a means to the political solution of Tamil political aspiration.Issues of militarisation of the North, including the occupation of Tamil lands, remain a potent point of dispute. After his victory, in the first rally addressing the Tamil, Dissanayake promised to gradually return their land grabbed by state agencies. With the closure of the Paruthithurai camp, some lands have already been handed back to the Tamil owners. The important constitutional reform that will resolve ethnic conflict is yet to be implemented. With the NPP dominating the parliament and the complete erosion of the traditional political parties, Sri Lanka is expected to move to new politics that promises to be responsive to the marginal working class, who form the bulk of the voters for the NPP.Given the challenges, India and Sri Lanka should be careful to advance their relations in a mutually beneficial way without giving in to nationalist fervour on both sides.

Having seen historic events unfold from close quarters, PL knew about the feet of clay of many illustrious figures of politics and society. But he also knew what to show to hide revealing details. When probed, he would deftly turn his banter towards love, life and the pleasures of singledom followed by a belly laugh. Even though a long-time close associate of Ganeshman Singh, PL came into prominence during the nationwide Satyagraha (Civil Disobedience) in 1985 that the-then proscribed Nepali Congress (NC) lad launched against the autocratic Shah regime called Panchayat. With many important leaders taken into preventive custody, he was left to face the press with staid stories of democratic struggles. He would often add anecdotal spice to get some space in the international media.After the restoration of democracy in 1990, PL first became the Mayor of Kathmandu and subsequently a member of Parliament, but he felt constrained by the limits any official position puts upon personal freedoms. By the late noughties, he had had enough of everything—party, family, friends and even trusted lieutenants of the younger generation that adored him—and had begun to find contentment within himself. On a sunny afternoon in a darkened room at Chaksibari about a year or so ago, he had slowly gotten up from the bed to enjoy a few spoonsful of his favourite buff dish thathale with some beaten rice and declared to ‘unannounced visitors’ that had been ushered in by photojournalist Min Bajracharya: It’s difficult to save the country and impossible to bring back the Nepali Congress to its founding principles. It was sad to see an eternal optimist with a permanent smile turn into a despondent warrior. The challenges of “saving the country” are either so complex that only some great minds can engage with them or so pedestrian that any rabblerouser can misuse them to fulfil his dictatorial ambitions, just as in 1960 or 2005. The NC’s founding principles are an altogether different matter. Its response must begin with a question: Did it have any to begin with? The Praja Parishad—literally a Subjects’ Council and clearly a contradiction in terms—was the oldest political party. It was formed to negotiate for more rights for the emergent social elites. Some embryonic communist groups primarily centred around towns in Madhesh drew their inspiration from Moscow. The NC came into being to oust the Ranarchy and establish a parliamentary democracy. These were fine political goals, but it would be vain to call them “founding principles”. The Chinese nationalist leader Sun Yat-sen (1866-1925) had declared the Three Principles of the People—nationalism, democracy and socialism—as the fundamental doctrine of the Kuomintang party. The NC adopted them when transforming itself from a revolutionary party into a reformist outfit after the Shah Restoration in 1951. Driven underground after the Royal-Military coup in 1960, the only goal of the NC thereafter became the restoration of parliamentary democracy and there it remained till the 1990s. An outline of post-1990 ideology and its subsequent erosion must be derived from messages that emanated from the lifestyle of its leading lights. Mahatma Gandhi’s dictum that his life was his message is applicable to the praxis of most longstanding politicos. Political driftWhen BP Koirala passed away in 1982, NC cadres were left without a rahbar—an Urdu term for a coach, a counsellor, a friend, a philosopher and a guide rolled into one—who was also a leader, described as someone “who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way”. There were no feet in the party big enough to fit those humongous shoes. It fell upon the troika—Ganeshman Singh, KP Bhattarai and GP Koirala—to first save, and then reenergise, reorganise and revive the NC that was almost on its deathbed. Till the late-1980s, the Nepali Congress had been a quintessential ‘umbrella party’ that had provided shelter to all kinds of opinions opposed to the authoritarian Shah regime. Forged in the fire of relentless struggle against successive Rana and Shah regimes, Ganeshman had a will of steel that couldn’t be bent, let alone be broken. As the only surviving ‘four stars’ of the NC—BP Koirala, Subarna Shamsher and Surya Prasad Upadhayay were contestably considered as three others—it fell upon him to keep the flame of revolution burning. Towards the end of his life, when he was forced to choose between his liberal principles and the party that he had helped create, he picked the former. He lived to the promise of Robert Browning’s lines from Prospice that he so liked: “I was ever a fighter, so—one fight more, / The best and the last!”Krishna Prasad Bhattarai was an atypical democrat of the British tradition: Loyalty to the crown and commitment to the subjects. Tracing his ancestry to a pujari that had accompanied the victorious King Prithivi Narayan Shah from Gorkha to Kathmandu, he was fully convinced that his ascetic lifestyle and daily recital of Bhagavad Gita had helped him endure long internments at the Sundarijal Military Detention Camp and the Nakhu Jail. The resilience and positivity that he displayed through repeated electoral defeats strengthened his image of a Nishkam Karmayogi. To quote Will Cuppy, he was a hermit and hence “simply a person to whom civilization has failed to adjust itself.”Despite his obdurate demeanour, GP Koirala was a pragmatic dealmaker who could negotiate with anyone without compromising his core convictions. If it entailed making a deal with the devil to save his cadres, he was ready to do it, as he unsuccessfully tried by submitting a petition to the palace in 1985 for gradual reforms to the chagrin of Ganeshman. When pushed into a corner through the creeping coup of King Gyanendra between 2002 and 2005, he brought Maoists from their undisclosed hideouts in and outside the country to fight together for “full democracy”.Power shiftPerhaps it was GP Koirala’s Faustian bargain with the CPN-UML after 2006 to keep the Maoists in check that pushed the NC towards a slow but sustained decline. The UML had emerged as an ethnonational outfit of the Permanent Establishment of Nepal (PEON) after the 1990s and had managed to penetrate almost all organs of the state. The party controlled a significant section of the media and held almost a total sway over the powerful NGO industry. Finally, it was Sushil Koirala, the dotard at Baluwatar in 2015, that fell into the ethnonational trap of ‘Oli-garchy’ by signing on the dotted lines of a 16-point conspiracy of fast-tracking a majoritarian statute.Cadres assigned to the 100-day campaign of the NC have discovered what everybody has known all along since 2015—the Grand Old Party of Nepali politics isn’t dynamic anywhere in the country. The powerlessness of the chair of the largest party in the Pratinidhi Sabha is understandable. Sher Bahadur Deuba has to seek the shelter of either a fallen Maoist or a neo-convert to Xi Jinping thought, a ‘Jinpingist’ as it were, to keep the kleptocratic order in the country stable and functional. ","summary":"PL Singh, 88, passed on peacefully in the wee hours of December 16, 2024. Having seen historic events unfold from close quarters, PL knew about the feet of clay of many illustrious figures of politics and society. But he also knew what to show to hide revealing details. When probed, he would deftly turn his banter towards love, life and the pleasures of singledom followed by a belly laugh. Even though a long-time close associate of Ganeshman Singh, PL came into prominence during the nationwide Satyagraha (Civil Disobedience) in 1985 that the-then proscribed Nepali Congress (NC) lad launched against the autocratic Shah regime called Panchayat. With many important leaders taken into preventive custody, he was left to face the press with staid stories of democratic struggles. He would often add anecdotal spice to get some space in the international media.After the restoration of democracy in 1990, PL first became the Mayor of Kathmandu and subsequently a member of Parliament, but he felt constrained by the limits any official position puts upon personal freedoms. By the late noughties, he had had enough of everything—party, family, friends and even trusted lieutenants of the younger generation that adored him—and had begun to find contentment within himself. On a sunny afternoon in a darkened room at Chaksibari about a year or so ago, he had slowly gotten up from the bed to enjoy a few spoonsful of his favourite buff dish thathale with some beaten rice and declared to ‘unannounced visitors’ that had been ushered in by photojournalist Min Bajracharya: It’s difficult to save the country and impossible to bring back the Nepali Congress to its founding principles. It was sad to see an eternal optimist with a permanent smile turn into a despondent warrior. The challenges of “saving the country” are either so complex that only some great minds can engage with them or so pedestrian that any rabblerouser can misuse them to fulfil his dictatorial ambitions, just as in 1960 or 2005. The NC’s founding principles are an altogether different matter. Its response must begin with a question: Did it have any to begin with? The Praja Parishad—literally a Subjects’ Council and clearly a contradiction in terms—was the oldest political party. It was formed to negotiate for more rights for the emergent social elites. Some embryonic communist groups primarily centred around towns in Madhesh drew their inspiration from Moscow. The NC came into being to oust the Ranarchy and establish a parliamentary democracy. These were fine political goals, but it would be vain to call them “founding principles”. The Chinese nationalist leader Sun Yat-sen (1866-1925) had declared the Three Principles of the People—nationalism, democracy and socialism—as the fundamental doctrine of the Kuomintang party. The NC adopted them when transforming itself from a revolutionary party into a reformist outfit after the Shah Restoration in 1951. Driven underground after the Royal-Military coup in 1960, the only goal of the NC thereafter became the restoration of parliamentary democracy and there it remained till the 1990s. An outline of post-1990 ideology and its subsequent erosion must be derived from messages that emanated from the lifestyle of its leading lights. Mahatma Gandhi’s dictum that his life was his message is applicable to the praxis of most longstanding politicos. Political driftWhen BP Koirala passed away in 1982, NC cadres were left without a rahbar—an Urdu term for a coach, a counsellor, a friend, a philosopher and a guide rolled into one—who was also a leader, described as someone “who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way”. There were no feet in the party big enough to fit those humongous shoes. It fell upon the troika—Ganeshman Singh, KP Bhattarai and GP Koirala—to first save, and then reenergise, reorganise and revive the NC that was almost on its deathbed. Till the late-1980s, the Nepali Congress had been a quintessential ‘umbrella party’ that had provided shelter to all kinds of opinions opposed to the authoritarian Shah regime. Forged in the fire of relentless struggle against successive Rana and Shah regimes, Ganeshman had a will of steel that couldn’t be bent, let alone be broken. As the only surviving ‘four stars’ of the NC—BP Koirala, Subarna Shamsher and Surya Prasad Upadhayay were contestably considered as three others—it fell upon him to keep the flame of revolution burning. Towards the end of his life, when he was forced to choose between his liberal principles and the party that he had helped create, he picked the former. He lived to the promise of Robert Browning’s lines from Prospice that he so liked: “I was ever a fighter, so—one fight more, / The best and the last!”Krishna Prasad Bhattarai was an atypical democrat of the British tradition: Loyalty to the crown and commitment to the subjects. Tracing his ancestry to a pujari that had accompanied the victorious King Prithivi Narayan Shah from Gorkha to Kathmandu, he was fully convinced that his ascetic lifestyle and daily recital of Bhagavad Gita had helped him endure long internments at the Sundarijal Military Detention Camp and the Nakhu Jail. The resilience and positivity that he displayed through repeated electoral defeats strengthened his image of a Nishkam Karmayogi. To quote Will Cuppy, he was a hermit and hence “simply a person to whom civilization has failed to adjust itself.”Despite his obdurate demeanour, GP Koirala was a pragmatic dealmaker who could negotiate with anyone without compromising his core convictions. If it entailed making a deal with the devil to save his cadres, he was ready to do it, as he unsuccessfully tried by submitting a petition to the palace in 1985 for gradual reforms to the chagrin of Ganeshman. When pushed into a corner through the creeping coup of King Gyanendra between 2002 and 2005, he brought Maoists from their undisclosed hideouts in and outside the country to fight together for “full democracy”.Power shiftPerhaps it was GP Koirala’s Faustian bargain with the CPN-UML after 2006 to keep the Maoists in check that pushed the NC towards a slow but sustained decline. The UML had emerged as an ethnonational outfit of the Permanent Establishment of Nepal (PEON) after the 1990s and had managed to penetrate almost all organs of the state. The party controlled a significant section of the media and held almost a total sway over the powerful NGO industry. Finally, it was Sushil Koirala, the dotard at Baluwatar in 2015, that fell into the ethnonational trap of ‘Oli-garchy’ by signing on the dotted lines of a 16-point conspiracy of fast-tracking a majoritarian statute.Cadres assigned to the 100-day campaign of the NC have discovered what everybody has known all along since 2015—the Grand Old Party of Nepali politics isn’t dynamic anywhere in the country. The powerlessness of the chair of the largest party in the Pratinidhi Sabha is understandable. Sher Bahadur Deuba has to seek the shelter of either a fallen Maoist or a neo-convert to Xi Jinping thought, a ‘Jinpingist’ as it were, to keep the kleptocratic order in the country stable and functional.

Political parties have turned educational institutions into their playgrounds, weakening the foundation and values of these establishments. This is evident in the recent hullabaloo over the appointment of deans at Tribhuvan University (TU), Nepal’s oldest. The dean positions were vacant since June this year, and disagreements in the executive council over the selections had hindered the selection process before Dashain. The major political parties and their student unions did their best to manipulate the merit-based appointment system, while criticising each other for ‘politicising’ higher education. The tug-of-war between the parties finally ended with the appointment of deans in five study institutes and three faculties of the university. However, these appointments have once again laid bare the practice of bhagbanda between the CPN-UML, the Nepali Congress, and the CPN (Maoist Centre).For fair selection, the executive council issued procedures for appointing deans and formed recommendation committees to suggest candidates based on merit. However, these committees have no more than symbolic value in a country where corruption seeps into the very systems intended to eradicate it. When vice-chancellor Keshar Jung Baral tried to appoint the deans and campus chiefs based on “meritocracy”, the recommendation committee did not rank professors affiliated with the UML on top. This did not please the UML and Baral was criticised at the University’s senate meeting. Although the UML’s protest reflects its vested interests, Baral’s claim of merit-based dean recommendation is contaminated by his own controversial past, raising doubts over his intent. In February, then-Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal had appointed Baral as vice-chancellor even though he was second in line after Chitra Bahadur Budhathoki.To sum up, meritocracy was seen only on paper, as wherever there was political interest, selections weren’t based on merit. Ultimately this time, three Congress-affiliated professors, and two each from the UML and the Maoist Centre, were appointed deans, in addition to one with no clear political ties. It is now well established that politicisation of higher education does a lot of harm. Once renowned for its academic excellence, India’s Jawaharlal Nehru University has devolved into a hotspot for political unrest, with strikes and protests harming its academic standing. Similarly, Karachi University in Pakistan has suffered a lot from political polarisation, resulting in on-campus violence and administrative blunders.The logic is straightforward: Those who have mastered academia are best equipped to understand and manage educational institutions. However, such reasoning does not work in Tribhuvan University, where the chancellor, the highest-ranking official in the university, is the prime minister. Although the universities’ laws authorise the prime minister, as an ex-officio chancellor, to appoint vice-chancellors from among the three names recommended by the search committees, the prime minister typically appoints individuals aligned with their party, triggering a domino effect that ultimately undermines the merit-based system. Such unnatural appointments to major positions in educational institutions in turn disrupt the university’s intellectual ecosystem. It is high time we got to the root of politicisation of education and nipped it in the bud. The political parties cannot be allowed to use educational institutions as an extension of party organisations and risk the future of hundreds of thousands of students. At a time when we are witnessing a mass exodus of students due to their increasing distrust in our higher education, political parties must step aside and allow those who understand the institutions the best to lead. It is about time we created an education system that works for the benefit of students rather than politicians.

Such sightseeing adventures also significantly benefit hotels, airlines, local businesses and the country’s overall economy. However, starting January 1, 2025, the Sagarmatha National Park has decided to impose a blanket ban on helicopter sightseeing tours in the region. This has sparked an acrimonious debate among stakeholders.This seemingly lucrative tourism practice has a darker side. While helicopters support tourism in the national park and surrounding region, they are harmful to the wild animals living in the park’s relatively undisturbed areas. According to official data, there are over 6,000 chopper flights in the Everest region during spring and autumn—the peak tourist seasons. These flights cause excessive noise pollution and disrupt the wildlife’s feeding and breeding patterns. Low-flying helicopters are particularly dangerous to the Himalayan Tahr and Himalayan Goral. According to park sources, some animals are dying by jumping off the cliffs due to the abrupt, loud noises of the choppers. Others are fleeing their natural habitats and straying into nearby villages where they pose challenges to local communities. Thus the park’s concern about wildlife is understandable. It is also home to the world’s rarest species, including snow leopards and red pandas. The protection of these animals cannot be overlooked as it helps maintain biodiversity and contributes to wildlife tourism. According to park officials, other reasons, including haphazard landing of the copters and suspicion of transport of wildlife contraband also prompted them to take such an action. However, the abrupt and arbitrary manner in which the ban was imposed is concerning as it will affect the region’s tourism. Tour operators, helicopter companies, as well as the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, the country’s civil aviation regulator, have criticised the ban made without consultations and exploration of alternatives. The CAAN has also clarified that the park has no legal basis to enforce such a ban.Nepal’s tourism sector is still in the post-Covid recovery phase. To make things worse, the European Union has extended its ban on Nepali airlines. Entrepreneurs who have invested in tourism are still suffering big losses. At this juncture, high-end tourism products like helicopter sightseeing could be a lifesaver for the ailing industry. So rather than blaming each other, the park and civil aviation authorities should try to find common ground and opt for a more balanced approach. As experts have suggested, establishing designated flight corridors away from sensitive wildlife habitats or conservation areas could be a viable solution to cut noise pollution. If concerns of the national park authority related to contraband and haphazard landings are genuine, monitoring activities in the region should be strengthened, and the aviation watchdog should hold the operators involved accountable. Wildlife and tourism are lifelines of our economy and there is a need to maintain a calibrated balance between the two.

How is the coalition of the two biggest political parties faring? The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Krishna Khanal, a professor of political science, for his insights.How do you evaluate the performance of the Congress-UML government based on the pledges they made at the time of coalition formation?Two biggest parties getting together to form a government is a bit unusual in the system we have adopted. The strength of the system is that the government can be made accountable by a strong opposition. But when the two biggest parties join hands to run the government, the opposition in the House becomes weak. This is a concern. The Congress and the UML have had joint governments in critical junctures in the past. Now, there is no extraordinary situation requiring them to forge a coalition but they justified it saying it would end political instability. Their argument was that unreasonable bargaining of smaller parties made the prime ministers weak. That’s partially true. However, the crux of the matter is that they wanted to enjoy consolidated power. KP Oli wanted to be prime minister and the Congress leaders who were out of power wanted to return to Singha Durbar. So they signed the seven-point deal with the pledge of amending the constitution.Has this coalition been a success? What are the initial indications?There are certain curious things. The seven-point agreement doesn’t say the UML will hand over government leadership to the Congress in the second phase of their partnership. It says, after two years, UML chair Oli will hand it over to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. It shows how our parties have become leader-centric instead of institution-centric. After all, Oli and Deuba are the chiefs and parliamentary leaders of their respective parties and they are the ones who will lead the government. Still they wished to specifically mention their names, which indicates they still feel insecure. Likewise, Prime Minister Oli says that he is handing over power to Deuba in July 2026. Recently he said he is handing it over after 18 months. Despite there being a written agreement, he keeps repeating the timeline. This suggests mutual mistrust due to past records of betrayal. It is true that the Congress and the UML together have a strong majority in the House and, with the backing of a few other smaller forces, they can manage two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. But when it comes to political issues, even the small parties in the coalition are hardly on the same page. So numerical strength alone won’t work. Hence there has been no progress on constitution amendment in the past five months. These pledges were made just to create a pretext to get to power.Is the present government any different to the erstwhile Dahal-led coalition, particularly on delivery?No. In the seven-point agreement, they pledged to improve the ailing economy. We don’t find any reform and the economy is still stagnant. I can’t recall a single thing this government has done that is worth appreciating. The only thing this coalition has achieved is ending unusual power manoeuverings by Prachanda [Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. The way Dahal was switching alliance partners between the Congress and the UML was unnatural. The present coalition ended the trend, at least for now. Also, some unhealthy activities taking place in provinces have been stopped. But the government has utterly failed to provide any relief to the people. What about the process of amending the constitution?The Congress and the UML leaders have often blamed the proportional representation (PR) electoral system for the country’s political instability. The UML proposed to limit the scope of the PR system to the National Assembly and some Congress leaders have also floated this idea. After the formation of this government, many people assumed that this coalition may take some action to implement those propositions. But doing so is not easy. Despite a strong majority in the House, the Congress and the UML alone can’t amend the constitution. Other small parties won’t support them to water down the PR system. The top leaders are conspicuously silent as they know diverse issues are going to open up once they start the process. For instance, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party wants to revive Hindu monarchy and the Madhes-based parties have their own grievances. Moreover, if you analyse the election results since 2008, it’s not difficult to infer that not only small parties but even the major forces will think twice before making any changes to the PR system. Be it big or small, old or new parties, all have gotten a significant number of seats under the PR category. In the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008, the Congress and the UML were in crisis. It was the PR system that saved them from being pushed into an existential crisis. Besides that, there is one big political reason behind the adoption of this electoral system and that is to ensure representation of various underprivileged communities in state organs. We can’t forget that context. Hence the Congress and UML leaders have been silent on the constitution amendment in the past couple of months.Is there any need to review or amend the constitution?There is a need to seriously review and analyse the problems faced in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. For instance, the vice-president has no role. He can be made ex-officio chair of the National Assembly, as in India. Then, the state doesn’t need to elect the upper house chair. This option was discussed during constitution writing as well. Recently, we conducted by-polls to fill the vacant positions of chiefs of local units. These polls were unnecessary as there can be a provision to entrust the deputy chiefs with the responsibility of carrying out the chief’s duties when the position goes vacant. There is a need for a comprehensive review and changes in some provisions based on the practical experience of statute implementation. But there are different parties and groups that want to raise different political agendas. For instance, some want a more powerful federal system while others want to scrap the system and revive Hindu monarchy. How should we review the national charter and what kind of mechanism will be right for that?The best way is through a review commission composed of politicians and subject experts. But leaders don’t trust independent experts who don’t follow their instructions. Forming a body of experts loyal to the leaders is meaningless. Therefore, a special parliamentary committee can be entrusted with this task. The panel will be composed of members from political parties based on their strength in the House. The parties and other stakeholders can submit their formal proposals to the committee and the experts can give their inputs to the same panel. The body can help give shape to the ongoing debates and discussions will take place in a more organised and formal way. It can conduct a thorough study of the complications seen in the course of constitution implementation. My emphasis is not on amending the constitution on political grounds but from the perspectives of removing difficulties experienced in the course of implementation. For instance, provinces have failed to prove their relevance. Now, we need to study where the problems are. But I don’t think the political parties are going to work on this issue with the seriousness it deserves. Leaders, of late, have proposed to increase the threshold to secure seats under the PR category, which can be done by amending election laws. They have floated the idea of increasing the PR threshold to five percent. [At present, it is three percent at the federal and 1.5 percent at the provincial level]. If it is increased to five percent, hardly four or five political parties may qualify for the PR seats. So this is not an appropriate proposal. To ensure political stability, we have to instead develop a system supportive of a coalition culture. The problem lies in our leaders and not in the constitution. For instance, why did Prachanda switch alliances multiple times after the last election? There is no point in blaming the system for instability. To discuss and debate all these issues, we need a review body.What is your analysis of the recent local by-polls results?The voting pattern shows that the big parties couldn’t increase their vote shares and failed to attract voters. The Congress lost more seats in comparison to the last by-polls. The UML had mixed results while the Maoist Centre made some gains. As it fought single-handedly this time, the Congress lost some seats that it had won with the support of alliance partners last time. This is natural. The Maoist Centre appears to have benefitted by being in the opposition and as it concentrated its strengths in select areas for the past few months. Party chief Dahal himself visited some remote local units. The Congress doesn’t appear serious about reviewing its poor performance while the UML has decided to study the matter and find what went wrong. The Maoist leaders look excited but the party has not made much progress in popular votes. There are assumptions of some informal collaborations between the Maoist Centre and the Rastriya Swatantra Party. The way Dahal has defended Rabi Lamichhane in recent days backs the assumption.Why do you think the performance of new forces including the RSP and Janamat were poor in the by-polls?My assumption is that voters rethought the need to change the party of their choice if the main objective of the leaders from new parties is to be ministers. RSP chief Rabi Lamichhane insisted on becoming home minister. In the meantime, recent investigations have shown his linkages to cooperative scams. People might have thought that he is not a clean person. These factors might have played a role. Last time, people supported new forces not to make their leaders ministers but for political reforms. The chief minister from Janamat Party who is leading the provincial government in Madhesh formed a 20-member Cabinet, which is the biggest ever there. He downsized it only after severe criticism. Such developments certainly play a role in elections. These are just assumptions. We can’t jump to conclusions but it is safe to say that Nepali voters are consistently trying to find better alternatives.While there were reports of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari rejoining the UML to return to active politics, former Vice-President Nanda Bahadur Pun is most likely to join the Maoist Centre. What kind of precedent will this set?I don’t see serious problems in former vice-presidents rejoining active politics as they don’t play any vital role as vice-presidents. But the issue of former Presidents returning to active politics is serious as such a precedent will invite serious anomalies. Though the constitution and laws don't bar former presidents from making such a comeback, politics should be guided by certain values, principles and convictions. Bhandari’s return to active politics will be unfortunate. It should be stopped. ","summary":"It has been five months since the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML formed a coalition government on July 15 by stepping on the seven-point deal inked on July 1. How is the coalition of the two biggest political parties faring? The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Krishna Khanal, a professor of political science, for his insights.How do you evaluate the performance of the Congress-UML government based on the pledges they made at the time of coalition formation?Two biggest parties getting together to form a government is a bit unusual in the system we have adopted. The strength of the system is that the government can be made accountable by a strong opposition. But when the two biggest parties join hands to run the government, the opposition in the House becomes weak. This is a concern. The Congress and the UML have had joint governments in critical junctures in the past. Now, there is no extraordinary situation requiring them to forge a coalition but they justified it saying it would end political instability. Their argument was that unreasonable bargaining of smaller parties made the prime ministers weak. That’s partially true. However, the crux of the matter is that they wanted to enjoy consolidated power. KP Oli wanted to be prime minister and the Congress leaders who were out of power wanted to return to Singha Durbar. So they signed the seven-point deal with the pledge of amending the constitution.Has this coalition been a success? What are the initial indications?There are certain curious things. The seven-point agreement doesn’t say the UML will hand over government leadership to the Congress in the second phase of their partnership. It says, after two years, UML chair Oli will hand it over to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. It shows how our parties have become leader-centric instead of institution-centric. After all, Oli and Deuba are the chiefs and parliamentary leaders of their respective parties and they are the ones who will lead the government. Still they wished to specifically mention their names, which indicates they still feel insecure. Likewise, Prime Minister Oli says that he is handing over power to Deuba in July 2026. Recently he said he is handing it over after 18 months. Despite there being a written agreement, he keeps repeating the timeline. This suggests mutual mistrust due to past records of betrayal. It is true that the Congress and the UML together have a strong majority in the House and, with the backing of a few other smaller forces, they can manage two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. But when it comes to political issues, even the small parties in the coalition are hardly on the same page. So numerical strength alone won’t work. Hence there has been no progress on constitution amendment in the past five months. These pledges were made just to create a pretext to get to power.Is the present government any different to the erstwhile Dahal-led coalition, particularly on delivery?No. In the seven-point agreement, they pledged to improve the ailing economy. We don’t find any reform and the economy is still stagnant. I can’t recall a single thing this government has done that is worth appreciating. The only thing this coalition has achieved is ending unusual power manoeuverings by Prachanda [Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. The way Dahal was switching alliance partners between the Congress and the UML was unnatural. The present coalition ended the trend, at least for now. Also, some unhealthy activities taking place in provinces have been stopped. But the government has utterly failed to provide any relief to the people. What about the process of amending the constitution?The Congress and the UML leaders have often blamed the proportional representation (PR) electoral system for the country’s political instability. The UML proposed to limit the scope of the PR system to the National Assembly and some Congress leaders have also floated this idea. After the formation of this government, many people assumed that this coalition may take some action to implement those propositions. But doing so is not easy. Despite a strong majority in the House, the Congress and the UML alone can’t amend the constitution. Other small parties won’t support them to water down the PR system. The top leaders are conspicuously silent as they know diverse issues are going to open up once they start the process. For instance, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party wants to revive Hindu monarchy and the Madhes-based parties have their own grievances. Moreover, if you analyse the election results since 2008, it’s not difficult to infer that not only small parties but even the major forces will think twice before making any changes to the PR system. Be it big or small, old or new parties, all have gotten a significant number of seats under the PR category. In the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008, the Congress and the UML were in crisis. It was the PR system that saved them from being pushed into an existential crisis. Besides that, there is one big political reason behind the adoption of this electoral system and that is to ensure representation of various underprivileged communities in state organs. We can’t forget that context. Hence the Congress and UML leaders have been silent on the constitution amendment in the past couple of months.Is there any need to review or amend the constitution?There is a need to seriously review and analyse the problems faced in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. For instance, the vice-president has no role. He can be made ex-officio chair of the National Assembly, as in India. Then, the state doesn’t need to elect the upper house chair. This option was discussed during constitution writing as well. Recently, we conducted by-polls to fill the vacant positions of chiefs of local units. These polls were unnecessary as there can be a provision to entrust the deputy chiefs with the responsibility of carrying out the chief’s duties when the position goes vacant. There is a need for a comprehensive review and changes in some provisions based on the practical experience of statute implementation. But there are different parties and groups that want to raise different political agendas. For instance, some want a more powerful federal system while others want to scrap the system and revive Hindu monarchy. How should we review the national charter and what kind of mechanism will be right for that?The best way is through a review commission composed of politicians and subject experts.

During the visit, the two countries signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Framework Cooperation agreement. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Bishnu Rimal, chief advisor to the prime minister, who was one of the key interlocutors during the framework agreement negotiations, for insights on how the deals were finalised between the two countries.There are many queries about the details of the agreements signed between Nepal and China last week. Please tell us about the key points.Nepal and China had been exchanging documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative of China since 2020, under the BRI implementation plan. While signing any agreement, the two countries engage in rigorous negotiations and at times it takes a long time even to finalise a word. This time, we signed a framework agreement, which is like a basket, where we have put many things. It’s different from a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In the agreement, we have described its background, principles, objectives, the modality of mobilising financial resources and implementing mechanisms. Even the previous government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to finalise it but it didn’t in the end. Now we have taken it ahead. The new agreement should be understood in a context. In 2016, we were in government [during Oli’s first tenure] and we visited Beijing. At the time, China was supporting Nepal through the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) package. Later, the support was provided through the BRI and the THMDCN became a part of it. Nepal reached an MoU to this effect in 2017. After that, an implementation plan needed to be signed. Following the formation of the present government, we held discussions on this. The two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a four-member team for this specific purpose. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and lawyer Semanta Dahal from the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Khatiwada ji and myself from the UML were in the team. In the past, we have reached several agreements with China, India, the United States, Japan and various other countries and sought support from them. But we haven’t been able to properly utilise the support. Our [taskforce’s] focus was to ensure best use of the pledged amount and implement the agreements. At first, we studied the documents exchanged after 2020. At the beginning we forged consensus between the UML and the Congress and then shared the document with the Chinese side because it can only be implemented after it is acceptable for both sides. This time, we wanted to take the implementation process ahead because Nepal joined the BRI process years ago. Nepal has already joined China’s Global Development Initiative, which is an international development concept. But there were some confusions about our participation in development projects under the BRI. There needed to be more clarity on our side. At times, it has been dragged into controversy. We wanted to dispel rumours and confusions.First of all we all should know that the BRI is a framework and the agreement we signed is a basket deal. Later, we will select specific projects and negotiate on particular details and conditions. In fact, the debate ahead of the prime minister’s visit was driven by whether to take loans or grants from China. That was wrong. It is rather a project-based approach. On certain projects, we need all grants while on certain others, we may jointly develop them. Still in other projects, we have to seek concessional loans. All these things depend on what project we are talking about. If a project can pay back the loan, that could be dealt accordingly. But our discussions were driven by the concept of loan versus grant. Even top leaders got swayed by such narratives and reacted accordingly. China has declared huge grants to Nepal multiple times since 2016. But we haven’t been able to use them as we have to earmark the amounts and seek them. First, we have to say that we are going to use this money in these projects. We at the task force concluded that the amount of the grants pledged by China is enough for us for now. There is no need to take out a loan now. Our priority is to get the grants that have been stuck for years. Do we need to select certain projects for that?Yes, we have to first finalise the projects and prepare business plans. We can explore other options only if the grant money is insufficient for a particular project. For instance, if we start working on a cross-border railway, we would discuss whether the grant money is sufficient and whether to seek more grants or go for loans. We aren’t in that stage now. We are yet to receive the grant announced during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. Similarly, grants were announced during the China visits of then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, first President Rambaran Yadav and our prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Also, this time, the Chinese President has announced 500 million RMB in assistance. So, again, first we have to work to receive and use the grant money. For instance, recently, the Chinese side announced to provide electric vehicles worth US$10 million as support through the Chinese embassy. The EVs include public buses, ambulances and school vans but they release them only after we provide the specifications of the vehicles that we need. The amount we sign as a budgetary support can be used wherever we want but other sums are released only after we earmark them for certain projects. After a long negotiation, Nepal and China have agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’. What does that mean?During the negotiation, we had used the term ‘grant and different financing modalities’. Later, we agreed to replace the word ‘grant’ with ‘aid’. We did so as we wanted to keep the door open in terms of seeking support from a country. If we say that we won’t receive any support except grants, it creates complications in the overall investment scenario. The Chinese government may provide a certain amount of grant to the government of Nepal but it doesn’t give it to the private sector.If Nepal’s private sector plans to attract investment from China, the World Bank, the ADB or any other agencies, for example for a mega hydro project, they may not get it as the Chinese side knows that Nepal accepts only grants and no other form of investment. Such a condition creates complications as this agreement is applicable even for the private sector. Therefore, we didn’t want to close the door. We can’t say we accept loans from this country but not from the other. We accept assistance that serves our national interest.Will the negotiations now onward be project-specific then?Yes. It will be project and proposal specific. Such issues will be negotiated only when we discuss a certain project. Therefore, the ongoing debate over grants versus loan is pointless. For instance, we didn’t receive certain portions of the assistance announced by India immediately after the 2015 earthquakes. Such is also the case with China and with other countries on occasions as the conditions attached to them weren’t acceptable to us.After the failure in operating Pokhara Regional International Airport due to lack of business plans, people are now suspicious about the utilisation of any assistance fruitfully.How can you say the Pokhara airport project is a failure? First, one should study the airport’s capacity and check how many passengers are flying to Pokhara now. A good number of people are flying there. I think the interest rate on the loan we took from China to build the airport is no different to the rate we receive from the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral agencies. We can debate whether we have been able to operate the airport in its full capacity. But there is no need to scandalise it unnecessarily.Ahead of the prime minister’s visit, there were voices that Nepal should seek a waiver of Pokhara airport loan from China. What happened?Let me ask you a question. Imagine, you took a loan from Rastriya Banijya Bank to meet your needs. Say, there is a government led by a leader who favours you. Can the prime minister waive off your bank loan? No. You have to follow the system. So your question is wrong. The Pokhara airport deal is not a grant. It’s a commercial deal. Those who run the government can’t use the language of Durga Prasai, who threatens not to pay back bank loans. What are the agreements on road connectivity and cross-border railway projects?We have included five points under the infrastructure-urban development project. These are Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel, Hilsa Simkot Road Project, Kathmandu-Khandbari Road, Kimathanka Bridge, the cross-border railway project from Rasuwagadhi to Kathmandu and the Amargadhi City Hall. Likewise, we have included a cross-border transmission line to start energy trade with China. Under education and health, we agreed to establish universities and colleges. The Chinese side is carrying out a feasibility study of the railway project with a plan to complete it by 2026. Once the study is complete, we will discuss the funding modalities and business plans.What is the status of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel project?The China side is in a position to complete its feasibility study. After that, construction work will start.Nepal has signed so many agreements with China. While we have progressed a lot on paper, there is little progress on the ground. Will the present agreement make any substantive change in this connection?Nepal is behind on monitoring and follow up. We should have formed bilateral mechanisms and monitored work progress. Now, there is a sense of urgency in the government to expedite development works. An inter-agency mechanism will be formed within our government. It will monitor and facilitate the work and the line ministries will execute the plans.Why are the agreements signed with China not made public, unlike the deals inked with other countries?There is no problem in making them public because there is nothing to hide. But all agreements aren’t made public. The MCC Compact had to be taken to the parliament as people were divided over it. Then, it was publicly debated. Likewise, people are now expressing their curiosity towards the BRI documents. But there are many projects people don’t care about. When needed, the documents can be made public as nothing can be hidden these days. And there is nothing wrong in making them public.UMl’s coalition partner Congress was reportedly reluctant to sign the framework agreement. What was its concern?That is a wrong narrative. Both the UML and the Congress were on the same page. It was possible to conclude the agreements because we had consensus.But the Congress leaders expressed their concerns in public ahead of the visit and even after the signing of the deals.We have to follow the party’s official decisions, not the statements of individual leaders. How would it have been possible to reach agreements if there were differences in the two-party taskforce, in the leadership and the party’s official positions? It’s a Nepal-China agreement jointly done by the UML and the Congress, and backed by all other parties. The prime minister convened a meeting of former prime ministers and foreign ministers ahead of his visit. All of them advised the prime minister to sign the agreement with China. Why was the signing of the agreement delayed?While signing a bilateral agreement, we can’t think only from our perspective. Negotiation always takes long. The joint statement has stated that the two sides are ready to sign the BRI framework as soon as possible. It took time for us to share the documents with the Chinese side after we reached Beijing. It’s not like two leaders just sit, discuss and sign on that. They have to consult concerned ministries, departments and officials. The Chinese worked overnight after we submitted the documents. My impression is that the Chinese side showed magnanimity and adopted a short-cut approach and signed on the deals. They were ready to sign the agreements on our conditions. That was a wonderful gesture.What were the specific points of contention and how were they resolved?We substantially edited the documents that were exchanged in the past, making them more specific and converting them into a framework of cooperation. Therefore, the Chinese side needed at least a day to study them. They argued that it would work even without mentioning the word ‘grant’. In view of the narratives in Nepal, we proposed to use ‘grant’ or a word with similar meaning. Then, we proposed ‘aid assistance financing’, and they accepted the term.How will the new deal be implemented?There used to be confusion about whether a certain project is under the BRI. China said even the Pokhara airport project is under the BRI while we said it was initiated before that. Now onward, all projects with China will be under the BRI cooperation. All the financing and investments from China will enter Nepal through the BRI window. We will prioritise the projects already proposed and under study such as the railway project, Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, and Madan Bhandari University. We have agreed to strengthen connectivity on border points and work will be expedited there. That will help transform Nepal from a land-locked into a land-linked country.Why are the projects being developed with Chinese involvement so slow?These days the Chinese side tells us to give projects only after clearing the sites. For instance, the 17-km Syafrubeshi-Rasuwagadhi road is to be built by Chinese grants. There is one transmission pole standing in the way. We are yet to remove it from the construction site. They haven’t started the work citing the same reason. Creating an environment to work on the field is our responsibility. It’s not that only China-built projects are slow. Such is also the story with our projects with other countries and agencies. Even in the case of the MCC projects, it took a long time to finalise many issues. We are too slow in implementing agreements and executing projects. First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  ","summary":"Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned home on December 5 after a four-day official visit to China.

The Chinese government may provide a certain amount of grant to the government of Nepal but it doesn’t give it to the private sector.If Nepal’s private sector plans to attract investment from China, the World Bank, the ADB or any other agencies, for example for a mega hydro project, they may not get it as the Chinese side knows that Nepal accepts only grants and no other form of investment. Such a condition creates complications as this agreement is applicable even for the private sector. Therefore, we didn’t want to close the door. We can’t say we accept loans from this country but not from the other. We accept assistance that serves our national interest.Will the negotiations now onward be project-specific then?Yes. It will be project and proposal specific. Such issues will be negotiated only when we discuss a certain project. Therefore, the ongoing debate over grants versus loan is pointless. For instance, we didn’t receive certain portions of the assistance announced by India immediately after the 2015 earthquakes. Such is also the case with China and with other countries on occasions as the conditions attached to them weren’t acceptable to us.After the failure in operating Pokhara Regional International Airport due to lack of business plans, people are now suspicious about the utilisation of any assistance fruitfully.How can you say the Pokhara airport project is a failure? First, one should study the airport’s capacity and check how many passengers are flying to Pokhara now. A good number of people are flying there. I think the interest rate on the loan we took from China to build the airport is no different to the rate we receive from the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral agencies. We can debate whether we have been able to operate the airport in its full capacity. But there is no need to scandalise it unnecessarily.Ahead of the prime minister’s visit, there were voices that Nepal should seek a waiver of Pokhara airport loan from China. What happened?Let me ask you a question. Imagine, you took a loan from Rastriya Banijya Bank to meet your needs. Say, there is a government led by a leader who favours you. Can the prime minister waive off your bank loan? No. You have to follow the system. So your question is wrong. The Pokhara airport deal is not a grant. It’s a commercial deal. Those who run the government can’t use the language of Durga Prasai, who threatens not to pay back bank loans. What are the agreements on road connectivity and cross-border railway projects?We have included five points under the infrastructure-urban development project. These are Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel, Hilsa Simkot Road Project, Kathmandu-Khandbari Road, Kimathanka Bridge, the cross-border railway project from Rasuwagadhi to Kathmandu and the Amargadhi City Hall. Likewise, we have included a cross-border transmission line to start energy trade with China. Under education and health, we agreed to establish universities and colleges. The Chinese side is carrying out a feasibility study of the railway project with a plan to complete it by 2026. Once the study is complete, we will discuss the funding modalities and business plans.What is the status of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel project?The China side is in a position to complete its feasibility study. After that, construction work will start.Nepal has signed so many agreements with China. While we have progressed a lot on paper, there is little progress on the ground. Will the present agreement make any substantive change in this connection?Nepal is behind on monitoring and follow up. We should have formed bilateral mechanisms and monitored work progress. Now, there is a sense of urgency in the government to expedite development works. An inter-agency mechanism will be formed within our government. It will monitor and facilitate the work and the line ministries will execute the plans.Why are the agreements signed with China not made public, unlike the deals inked with other countries?There is no problem in making them public because there is nothing to hide. But all agreements aren’t made public. The MCC Compact had to be taken to the parliament as people were divided over it. Then, it was publicly debated. Likewise, people are now expressing their curiosity towards the BRI documents. But there are many projects people don’t care about. When needed, the documents can be made public as nothing can be hidden these days. And there is nothing wrong in making them public.UMl’s coalition partner Congress was reportedly reluctant to sign the framework agreement. What was its concern?That is a wrong narrative. Both the UML and the Congress were on the same page. It was possible to conclude the agreements because we had consensus.But the Congress leaders expressed their concerns in public ahead of the visit and even after the signing of the deals.We have to follow the party’s official decisions, not the statements of individual leaders. How would it have been possible to reach agreements if there were differences in the two-party taskforce, in the leadership and the party’s official positions? It’s a Nepal-China agreement jointly done by the UML and the Congress, and backed by all other parties. The prime minister convened a meeting of former prime ministers and foreign ministers ahead of his visit. All of them advised the prime minister to sign the agreement with China. Why was the signing of the agreement delayed?While signing a bilateral agreement, we can’t think only from our perspective. Negotiation always takes long. The joint statement has stated that the two sides are ready to sign the BRI framework as soon as possible. It took time for us to share the documents with the Chinese side after we reached Beijing. It’s not like two leaders just sit, discuss and sign on that. They have to consult concerned ministries, departments and officials. The Chinese worked overnight after we submitted the documents. My impression is that the Chinese side showed magnanimity and adopted a short-cut approach and signed on the deals. They were ready to sign the agreements on our conditions. That was a wonderful gesture.What were the specific points of contention and how were they resolved?We substantially edited the documents that were exchanged in the past, making them more specific and converting them into a framework of cooperation. Therefore, the Chinese side needed at least a day to study them. They argued that it would work even without mentioning the word ‘grant’. In view of the narratives in Nepal, we proposed to use ‘grant’ or a word with similar meaning. Then, we proposed ‘aid assistance financing’, and they accepted the term.How will the new deal be implemented?There used to be confusion about whether a certain project is under the BRI. China said even the Pokhara airport project is under the BRI while we said it was initiated before that. Now onward, all projects with China will be under the BRI cooperation. All the financing and investments from China will enter Nepal through the BRI window. We will prioritise the projects already proposed and under study such as the railway project, Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, and Madan Bhandari University. We have agreed to strengthen connectivity on border points and work will be expedited there. That will help transform Nepal from a land-locked into a land-linked country.Why are the projects being developed with Chinese involvement so slow?These days the Chinese side tells us to give projects only after clearing the sites. For instance, the 17-km Syafrubeshi-Rasuwagadhi road is to be built by Chinese grants. There is one transmission pole standing in the way. We are yet to remove it from the construction site. They haven’t started the work citing the same reason. Creating an environment to work on the field is our responsibility. It’s not that only China-built projects are slow. Such is also the story with our projects with other countries and agencies. Even in the case of the MCC projects, it took a long time to finalise many issues. We are too slow in implementing agreements and executing projects. First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  "},{"hash":"6aefa87c5372da415729ba34119f452b28f118961283653d01b79fc38080bcb7","title":"rather-than-a-bridge-nepal-should-try-to-develop-as-a-port","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/12/02/rather-than-a-bridge-nepal-should-try-to-develop-as-a-port","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/interviews/Chinesemain-1733100908.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1733097600000,"source":"kp","category":"interviews","content":"Wang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best.

How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best.

He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  ","summary":"Former Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy.
