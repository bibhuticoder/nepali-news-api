The uncanny political developments in the country have propelled the speed of these events. Little worried by the indications of the erosion of the hard-earned democratic values and practices seen in political coalitions and the assault on media freedom, I briefly review the history of political leaders' dreams and failures in this column. I want to show that we, the people, bear the brunt of history’s tragic and farcical turns. An important shift has occurred in Nepali history from the tragic to the ludicrous. Karl Marx, in his famous work The Eighteenth Brumaire Of Louis Bonaparte, said, \"All the great events and characters of history occur twice, firstly as tragedy, secondly as farce.\" No communist leaders of Nepal appear to have referred to this book and Marx's prophetic statement except Baburam Bhattarai, the erstwhile Maoist leader and comrade of the current Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has recently got the vote of confidence for the fourth time in 17 months. This is an interesting episode of political farce. Political parties and the cronies who are always proactive are reducing the democratic system established by people's sacrifice and dedication to a farce. That becomes clear if we watch the drama that happens in Parliament.There is a serious part to this historical shift. Marx also says, \"The social revolution of the nineteenth century cannot create its poetry from the past but only from the future”. This means that to draw strength and meaning from the past, you should create its poetry from the future. This is a little academic point. Repetition of historyThe Nepali democracy and those who have been given the responsibility to protect and use it precisely lack that vision of futurity; they do not perceive the poetry of the future. Their actions in parliament, narrow partisan behaviours, the reckless language they use, inadequate knowledge about the political dynamics of social change and the important time they squander away by acting irresponsibly all show that they lack the vision to create poetry from the future. I have begun to wonder whether the Nepali political parties will fully utilise the democratic political system to ameliorate the condition of the people of this land.The Nepali media fraternity says the sudden arrest of Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya on May 21, 2024, is unfair and \"motivated by personal vendetta.\" The agency in question is the coalition government led by Dahal and the Home Ministry. A certain revelation occurred to me after watching an interview with Bhattarai on Kantipur television on the same night. Bhattarai recalled one article he published in Kantipur in August 2001 about the royal massacre. I was mourning my mother's death in my village, Sabala of Terathum. I read that article to my elder brother and Nepali Congress district leader, Laya Prasad Subedi, who totally agreed with Bhattarai's analysis. The underground Maoist leader Bhattarai has said in that article the murders were the result of a \"political conspiracy\". Kailash Sirohiya and his co-publisher, Binod Raj Gyawali, and the editor-in-chief of Kantipur, Yubaraj Ghimire, were arrested for publishing that. Bhattarai said in the interview that he was stunned by the drama of Sirohiya's arrest, which shows an uncanny repetition of history. This time, he said, “Prachanda is in the position of the king, and the same media person is arrested, as the common opinion says, for publishing news stories about Prachanda's government.” Bhattarai also revealed that in a prime ministerial system like ours, no such decision is taken without the prime minister's consent. It is not the minister but the prime minister who can make such decisions, he explained.Whatever the position of parties and the leaders at the current moment of history, those who have followed the political history know that Bhattarai has always made decisions according to his understanding, conscience and interpretation of history. Bhattarai had declared that he was leaving the Maoist party because, metaphorically, it was not safe to live in the red-labelled house, which was a category of the badly damaged buildings after the earthquakes of 2015. I am dismayed by the performances of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. I am getting more and more disillusioned by his actions and those of the other communist leaders of different groups who are all in the coalition now. They include communist stalwarts like Dahal, KP Sharma Oli and Madhav Kumar Nepal. There is no point in talking about the behaviour of the individual ministers, whose sense of history and the missions often don't come to the fore. The coalition’s leader and a major actor Dahal is at the centre of the decisions in this system if we believe the interpretation of the former prime minister Bhattarai.It is challenging for all political leaders to maintain a history of their choice and to live up to the expectations of the people. Dahal is no exception. I want to recall one event here. Dahal had attended the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi in the third week of November 2006. Some people told me about him when I attended a literary conference in Delhi after that event. One professor, impressed with Dahal’s metamorphosis, gave me the news published in the paper. It cites Dahal saying, \"I have lived my life in jungle, now I will lead my life in light.\" Another report said, ''Nepal's firebrand Maoist leader Prachanda on Saturday said the political battle in the 21st century will be fought over democracy, which at present is in deep crisis.\" A euphoric Dahal, by his transformation, said while addressing the second session on the second day of the fourth Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi, \"Democracy will rule the world\". The report also said, \"The former Indian prime minister and admirer of Prachanda I. K. Gujaral says he had read about many epic stories about revolution and Prachanda has shown it by accomplishing an epic battle in Nepal.\"History says Dahal and other leaders have clearly failed to deliver. His and his various coalitions’ actions show that staying in power is their only goal. What has begun to worry nonpartisan academics and writers like us is that the power coalitions and groups only work with what Bertrand Russell calls the “lust for power.” The time has come for the free media, legal activists and civil society to be vigilant about protecting democracy.  ","summary":"These days, I watch Nepali television news more frequently and read broadsheet papers and online news to observe the clash of dreams and reality, particularly in political events.

Leaders are created by movements, long democratic practices and immediate events triggered by people’s frustration and anger. However, instant leaders are short-lived and fade away after they fail to imbibe perseverance, commitment and the qualities of being patient. Such leaders are soon seduced by power and privileges as their role is made for the time being. In Nepal, many ambitious youth have shown the characteristics of instant leaders who are easily exposed and stigmatised. Watching the Indian political scene for the last few years, it seems that it is the coming of age of Rahul Gandhi. Sooner or later, he will likely play a crucial role in Indian politics. Rahul’s rise is possible not because he happened to be a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family but because of his dedication, perseverance, hard work and the ability to be closer to the people of India. Rather than being elitist, he is perceived as people-centred and egalitarian in his mission and actions, contrary to his aristocratic family background. Rahul is evolving as a leader despite the humiliation and insinuation hurled at him by his opponents.His mission to unify India, accept unity in the diversity of Indian society and polity, and his steadfast commitment to safeguarding the Republican constitution by finding suitable guardrails have paid him rich dividends in recent elections. Whatever the results, he has surpassed all other country leaders, endearing himself to ordinary people. Born with a silver spoon, Rahul has unique personality traits. He has the knack of being humble; sometimes, he finds himself in ordinary train compartments, travelling with fellow travellers, shaving his beard in an ordinary salon in Rae Bareli, eating chhole-bhature in Delhi street, mixing with kids while undertaking the Bharat Jodo Yatra, or taking sweets in an ordinary shop somewhere in South India. These activities make him the darling of the masses. Narendra Damodar Modi, now the Prime Minister, by contrast, also has the humble background of being the son of a tea-seller at the Gujrat railway station and has emerged as a charismatic leader over time. Nevertheless, the taste of power that he enjoyed as a long-time chief minister of Gujrat and later as the country leader for over a decade seems to have transformed him into an elitist leader with a disposition for a luxurious life. However, Modi continues to be popular among his colleagues and has become the only star campaigner for his party during the three parliamentary elections in 2014, 2019 and 2024. Weary and exhausted, Modi’s charisma is declining due to his age and failure to deliver on the people’s basic needs. Moreover, India today is a highly polarised country, as the BJP government is criticised for using religion as a weapon to scare minorities, especially Muslims. The Hindutwa agenda is interpreted as the divisive doctrine propounded and practised by orthodox BJP leaders. Contrarily, Rahul has taken up this agenda, arguing that he wants to propagate love, not hatred, as he has been repeating since his long march from the deep South to Kashmir and Manipur to Maharastra. He has assured the people that he would not allow the constitution, which embraces the “unity in diversity” principle, to be destroyed. Though it may appear highly populist, his commitment to providing jobs to the unemployed youths, delivering Rs100,000 to women each year, rescuing the peasants from loans, and rejecting the Agniveer Programme that aims to offer four-year jobs in the army and Rs1.2 million to retire the young soldiers seems to be a daunting task for any government. However, his task force brings such agendas to the fore after careful assessment and thinking. Rahul has revived the moribund Congress Party by single-handedly setting the agendas of rejuvenation and presenting himself as a formidable competitor to Modi, who, to many, is seen as invincible. Many still think Rahul is a weak opponent in the face of the Modi craze, which prevails among elites and commoners alike. Since such a myth has started showing diminishing trends in the wake of the general elections of 2024, electoral predictions may prove wrong, as some election results in the past had nullified. Simmering underground trends cannot be easily fathomed by simple guesswork. It’s better to watch the unfolding developments. Nevertheless, a leader is born. Rahul has no experience in any governmental office except for his short tenure as party president. Even his father, Rajiv, had suddenly been thrown into politics by his mother, following the death of his brother, Sanjay, in a plane crash. But Rajiv’s track record in government was neither dismal nor superb. However, he was the one who initiated dialogues with China, reaching some sort of understanding of the management of the northern borders. Bilateral relations had improved until quite recently. Modi’s long handshake and warm embrace with the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, didn’t prolong due to the increasing tensions developing along the border, including the loss of army personnel. Leadership matters much in politics. A leader’s upbringing is as essential as his intelligence, commitment to values and mission. So, the wrong person in office destroys institutions, as is evident in the Nepali context. If a leader is strong and widespread, having all the traits of a democratic culture, he is destined to be successful. As Henry Kissinger writes, “Without leadership, institutions drift, and nations court growing irrelevance and, ultimately, disaster”. In Nepal, too, young leaders are in the making, and given the opportunity, they would definitely be good at governing the country. Yet, new leaders also need to be good educators, communicators and responsible. Mere procedural leaders have little sense in the dynamic context of politics. Rahul Gandhi has both a good education and a good apprenticeship in democracy, making him sensitive to the needs of the common people.    ","summary":"The emergence of a leader is possible through hard work, confidence, determination, ideas and identification with issues.

Though it may appear highly populist, his commitment to providing jobs to the unemployed youths, delivering Rs100,000 to women each year, rescuing the peasants from loans, and rejecting the Agniveer Programme that aims to offer four-year jobs in the army and Rs1.2 million to retire the young soldiers seems to be a daunting task for any government. However, his task force brings such agendas to the fore after careful assessment and thinking. Rahul has revived the moribund Congress Party by single-handedly setting the agendas of rejuvenation and presenting himself as a formidable competitor to Modi, who, to many, is seen as invincible. Many still think Rahul is a weak opponent in the face of the Modi craze, which prevails among elites and commoners alike. Since such a myth has started showing diminishing trends in the wake of the general elections of 2024, electoral predictions may prove wrong, as some election results in the past had nullified. Simmering underground trends cannot be easily fathomed by simple guesswork. It’s better to watch the unfolding developments. Nevertheless, a leader is born. Rahul has no experience in any governmental office except for his short tenure as party president. Even his father, Rajiv, had suddenly been thrown into politics by his mother, following the death of his brother, Sanjay, in a plane crash. But Rajiv’s track record in government was neither dismal nor superb. However, he was the one who initiated dialogues with China, reaching some sort of understanding of the management of the northern borders. Bilateral relations had improved until quite recently. Modi’s long handshake and warm embrace with the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, didn’t prolong due to the increasing tensions developing along the border, including the loss of army personnel. Leadership matters much in politics. A leader’s upbringing is as essential as his intelligence, commitment to values and mission. So, the wrong person in office destroys institutions, as is evident in the Nepali context. If a leader is strong and widespread, having all the traits of a democratic culture, he is destined to be successful. As Henry Kissinger writes, “Without leadership, institutions drift, and nations court growing irrelevance and, ultimately, disaster”. In Nepal, too, young leaders are in the making, and given the opportunity, they would definitely be good at governing the country. Yet, new leaders also need to be good educators, communicators and responsible. Mere procedural leaders have little sense in the dynamic context of politics. Rahul Gandhi has both a good education and a good apprenticeship in democracy, making him sensitive to the needs of the common people.    "},{"hash":"840a7fc99d6fdb74eaf4d49d4f34743d366643c075017bf3957bb47d0e337b7a","title":"reckoning-with-a-new-authoritarian-bloc","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/05/25/reckoning-with-a-new-authoritarian-bloc","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/SideShutterstock2356088589-1716641845.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1716595200000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent visit to China—his first trip abroad since being “re-elected”—highlights an ongoing shift in the global order.

He later denied targeting the group that constitutes about 200 million of majority-Hindu India’s 1.4 billion people.“I want to vote for peace and brotherhood. It’s difficult that the BJP will garner any votes here,” said Mansuri, in a thought echoed by voters in Mustafabad, including some Hindus.Mithilesh, 42, a Hindu woman who gave only her first name, said she feared for her safety during the riots as a crowd stabbed two youths to death on her street while she was locked inside her house with her daughter-in-law.“We heard their screams and were scared of what would happen to us. Our member of parliament at the time was from the BJP, who wants votes again, but we will not vote for him.”Sabir Ali, 42, a Muslim tailor, said Modi’s speeches are just political rhetoric. “But if he thinks Muslims will vote for him despite these speeches, then he is mistaken.”In the nearby Jaffarabad area, Muslim grocery store owner Wasim Raja, 36, said high inflation was his main concern, as his business had taken a hit.“The Hindu-Muslim issue has always been there and we are all voting for Congress this time, but despite that the BJP will likely win,” he said.Support for the BJP, which looks set to return to power, was high in Hindu-dominated neighbourhoods as voters spoke of national pride and praised India’s economic growth.“Hindus have awakened now because of Modi, and this fire will not die down,” said Akash Kumar Kashyap, 48, who runs a transport business in the Bhajanpura area.\"Modi has improved the economy and infrastructure. He's grown India's stature globally, so we like him for that,\" said Mahesh Chand Barthwal, 35, who works in a law firm. ","summary":"Suhel Mansuri, who carries scars from Hindu-Muslim riots that killed dozens in his district of India’s capital in 2020, says his vote on Saturday in national elections was for “peace and brotherhood” as divisive religious rhetoric rises.Mansuri and his brother were surrounded by a crowd during the riots in Delhi’s most densely populated district and beaten with iron rods and bricks, resulting in multiple bone fractures.Saturday’s vote is the first since the riots in which at least 53 people, mostly Muslims, were killed and more than 500 injured as crowds roamed the streets for days, attacking each other with swords and guns, and setting buildings on fire.“I don’t want anyone to suffer like this ever again,” said Mansuri, 29, a Muslim who has a small clothing business in the Mustafabad area. “People forget that we’re all just the same as the next person when they are incited by hateful speeches.”Rhetoric focussing on religion and inequality has dominated much of India’s massive seven-phase vote running through June 1, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) faces accusations of targeting minority Muslims in its campaign.The Northeast Delhi constituency elected a BJP lawmaker in the past two national elections, in 2014 and 2019.Modi, favoured to become only the second person to win three consecutive terms as India’s prime minister, referred to Muslims as “infiltrators” and people who have “more children” in a speech last month. He later denied targeting the group that constitutes about 200 million of majority-Hindu India’s 1.4 billion people.“I want to vote for peace and brotherhood. It’s difficult that the BJP will garner any votes here,” said Mansuri, in a thought echoed by voters in Mustafabad, including some Hindus.Mithilesh, 42, a Hindu woman who gave only her first name, said she feared for her safety during the riots as a crowd stabbed two youths to death on her street while she was locked inside her house with her daughter-in-law.“We heard their screams and were scared of what would happen to us.

A meeting of top leaders from major political parties—both ruling and opposition ones—agreed to end the House deadlock by forming a parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam with links to Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane. The leaders formed a taskforce of four second-rung leaders to prepare terms of reference for the probe panel. While defining the jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee, the task force member from Lamichhane’s Rastriya Swatantra Party even became ready to list the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane had allegedly received money. Whether to specifically mention Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction remained the major bone of contention and the members were trying to find a meeting point. In the meantime, the main opposition Nepali Congress became ready to allow Home Minister Lamichhane to address the House. For weeks, Lamichhane had been arguing that it was injustice to bar him from speaking in Parliament, thus depriving him of a chance at clarification. As per the understanding, Lamichhane addressed the House. Unfortunately, Lamichhane presented himself in an utterly irresponsible way, spending most of his time slinging mud at opposition lawmakers, and the Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa in particular—in fact at all those who were asking for a probe against him. He threw caution to the wind and tore parliamentary decorum to shreds. Had he presented himself in a responsible way and had he really wanted to use the opportunity to clear the old deadlock, his Sunday’s speech in the House could have been a turning point. Alas! It was just the opposite. He further provoked the opposition and spoiled the situation that was headed in a positive direction. The crux of his over half-an-hour-long lecture was that “if you all [leaders from opposition parties] have for so many years engaged in various wrongdoings, why should I be punished for following the same corrupt path?” He disappointed many of those who reckoned that the main opposition was doing Lamichhane injustice by depriving him of a chance to speak out on the allegations leveled against him. Instead of explaining his case based on facts, figures and documents, he threatened to reopen old cases in which opposition leaders were allegedly involved. While issuing such threats, he seemed to forget that he is the home minister who can immediately order law enforcement agencies to investigate and take actions against those involved in such crimes, including those publishing ‘baseless’ news against him. In doing so, he not only disappointed his followers but also, perhaps inadvertently, suggested that the country’s home minister is helpless to act while all kinds of grave crimes are happening all around him. Leaders often engage in heated arguments in the House. But someone in Lamichhane’s position—deputy prime minister, home minister and chair of the fourth largest parliamentary party—is expected to exercise a minimum level of restraint. When they speak from the Parliament’s rostrum, they not only address other lawmakers in the hall but also millions of people in and outside the country. Lamichhane went way beyond that red line on Sunday.

Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled “Implementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Nepal” is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime minister’s office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the plan’s signing.“It is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,” Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.“The country’s economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,” said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the “Silkroad Roadster” in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.“When the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime minister’s trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an ‘appropriate’ time,” former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. “We also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.”The Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The document’s sub-section 12 titled ‘Other Areas’ under section 3 named ‘Cooperation Priorities’ mentions that “the two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperation”.It also says “the two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster management”.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority. In every high-level visit and meeting between Nepal and China, the initiative gets traction.Although there is no clear provision on whether the two sides should renew the agreement by exchanging correspondence, officials at the finance ministry said that would be the diplomatically correct way to go about it.There are concerns over the BRI’s stalled momentum in Nepal. The initiative’s stated focus is connectivity, trade, development strategies, and policy dialogues for cooperation in the fields of economy, environment, technology and culture.The agreement also aims to facilitate transit transport, logistics, transport network security and related infrastructure development through joint study and promote cross-border projects including railway, road, civil aviation, power grid, information and communication. The MoU also states that the two sides would conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement shortly and, if viable, start negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement to open up more markets and expand bilateral trade.Other stated areas of agreed cooperation are establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones at the existing ports, and improving the investment landscape with a view to developing mega projects in the areas of power generation, water conservation, road, railway line, cross-border transmission line, information and communication technology and infrastructure, besides customs and quarantine.Nepal also had a shaky position on the BRI in the past. After signing the deal in 2017, the government formed two committees headed by the foreign and finance secretaries to negotiate with China on the projects selected under the initiative. The finance secretary was tasked with project selection.As per the Cabinet’s mandate, the finance secretary-led committee picked 35 projects to be funded under the BRI. Then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli read out this list during his meeting with Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. Later, the Chinese side urged Kathmandu to cut the number of projects to a single digit, whereupon the list was pared down to nine projects.A former finance ministry official who was involved in several negotiations with the Chinese side said most of the nine projects were related to connectivity and infrastructure. In 2019, during the second BRI Conference in China, its outcome document listed Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network under the BRI. (Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari had attended the conference.) Then, when Chinese President Xi visited Kathmandu in October 2019, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation under the BRI.They agreed “to intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network with a view to significantly contributing to Nepal’s development agenda of graduating from a Least Developed Country,” according to a joint statement issued after Xi’s visit to Kathmandu.The Chinese side was keen to carry out the feasibility study of Kerung-Kathmandu railway under the BRI, the former finance ministry official said. “But we have shifting priorities on selecting and negotiating other projects.”The feasibility study of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway has already begun with a Chinese grant and it is expected to conclude by 2026 June, said Rohit Kumar Bisural, director general at Department of Railways.“As per our agreement, the feasibility study of the cross border railway should be completed by 2026 June. There are various studies on the ground. Nepali engineers and technical staff are not directly involved but they are supporting the Chinese technicians as required. There are no glitches. Once the study is complete, we will jointly write a report,” said Bisural.A joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that no tangible progress has been made in the past seven years in implementing the BRI plan and no agreement is likely anytime soon either.“This calls for consensus among the political parties as it is not just a matter of the government or one party,” said the joint-secretary. “The BRI is unlikely to move forward in Nepal anytime soon because there is no discussion, consultation and consensus among the major parties.”Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, former foreign minister and Nepal’s ex-ambassador to China, said many leaders and officials have blamed high-interest loans for not taking the BRI forward but that is not the reason.“We do not complete projects on time. If we did, we could easily pay back the loan and interest to China and other lending countries. Our leaders also fear the reaction of other countries [to accepting any kind of Chinese help],” said Pandey.“We have ‘fear psychosis’ while taking economic support,” he said. “Nepalis are scared that India, China or the United States will be angry if the country takes support from any one of them.” “We have to accept foreign support by taking neighbours and major powers into confidence,” Pandey said.

A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assembly’s strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. “The ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,” said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commission’s decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciary’s ambition. “We have seen judicial activism for a long time,” Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. “Setting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.”He said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most “anarchist” and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciary’s intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. “I see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,” he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the court’s ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top court’s door against the Election Commission’s move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new party—Janata Samajbadi Party. Yadav has termed the move unconstitutional.Observers say inter- and intra-party differences could have been sorted out through political negotiations. But several cases have landed in the court without any prior attempts to resolve them through dialogue. “In principle, the court has a role in settling cases with complex legal and constitutional questions,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer, told the Post. “Cases of the political nature unnecessarily drag the judiciary into controversy as the defending side always criticises it.”When the Supreme Court overturned the twin decisions of then KP Sharma Oli government to dissolve the House, the CPN-UML had publicly criticised the decision. Similarly, the court’s order to dissolve the Nepal Communist Party was termed as politically motivated and intended to favour Oli.In the views of the experts, such political cases are also wasting crucial time of the court. As such cases are given priority, decisions on other cases are delayed. “It is not the judiciary that should be determining the political order. The political leadership should be doing so,” Balaram KC, a former justice, told the Post. “The court should refrain from intervening in every political development. It must demarcate its jurisdiction.”KC says using the court to determine the political order is like taking paracetamol for a chronic disease; it may lower the fever and relieve the pain, but doesn’t cure the disease. “Political problems should be resolved politically for a long-term solution,” he said.Observers say the way political parties are delegating responsibilities to the judiciary could spell disaster for democracy.“Pakistan is a good example of what happens when the court’s ambitions grow,” Karna, the political science professor, said. “Why not correct it before it is too late?”Legal experts, however, do not see any threat of judicial supremacy. “The court passes a verdict based on the law and constitution. I, therefore, don’t see threat from the judiciary,” said Chapagain, the constitutional lawyer. “However, I see a need for a decision from the Supreme Court on setting demarcations on which types of cases it should consider.”  ","summary":"Nepal’s judiciary is often accused of engaging in judicial activism.The latest episode came on May 3. A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assembly’s strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. “The ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,” said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commission’s decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciary’s ambition. “We have seen judicial activism for a long time,” Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. “Setting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.”He said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most “anarchist” and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciary’s intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. “I see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,” he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the court’s ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top court’s door against the Election Commission’s move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new party—Janata Samajbadi Party.

It paints a stark picture of Nepal's climate change situation and urges necessary intervention for the resource-crunch Himalayan nation.According to the survey, the economic losses in farm and off-farm in the last five years, as reported by households, excluding significant infrastructure damages, amounted to Rs415.44 billion.Experts say worse is yet to come.In Nepal, the number of households unaware of the consequences of climate change is significantly high.The survey shows that many households reported adverse weather changes. They noted that their water resources dried up, new diseases infected crops, productivity losses rose, and flowering and fruiting behaviours changed over the last two and a half decades. Major economic sectors and essential services like health and education in Nepal have felt the repercussions of extreme weather events linked to climate change, the survey said.The statistics office said the sampling used the total number of households from the population census. In total, 6.66 million individual households were included in the frame. The survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews from July to March 2023 among 6,508 households in 326 primary sampling units, encompassing all seven provinces. The statistics office said all the respondents were at least 45 years old and had lived in the survey area for 25 years, forming the sampling frame that included households meeting these criteria across Nepal.According to the survey, over the past 25 years, approximately 50 percent of households reported the emergence of new diseases in their crops, 53.9 percent observed the presence of new insects or pests affecting their crops, and 29.8 percent of households noted the appearance of new diseases in their livestock.Nepal’s agriculture sector is the mainstay of the country’s economy. It contributes 24.60 percent to the country's GDP and employs over half of the population. The sector is mainly rainfed and heavily dependent on rainfall.When the rain fails to fall, the GDP takes a tumble. This dependence makes the country particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Rural areas experienced more new diseases affecting crops (55.9 percent) than urban areas (45.6 percent). The mountain region (68.7 percent), hill region (50.3 percent), and Tarai region (46.3 percent) also experienced an impact on crops due to new diseases. The survey report shows households in altitudes between 1,500 and 2,000 metres reported emergingnew crop diseases (60.2 percent) over the last 25 years. This shows diverse factors influence the prevalence of crop diseases across diverse geographical and climatic domains.“The situation is alarming,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the National Statistics Office.“The survey was intended to see people’s perception towards climate change, the most burning issue globally,” he said. Climate change literacy among people, mostly in rural areas, is shallow, but some exciting facts exist. “Most of the farmers surveyed are not clear whether climate change is bringing diseases and low yields, but at the same time, they have a coping mechanism knowingly or unknowingly,” said Regmi. For instance, farmers have changed the cropping pattern. “If they think rainfall will be below normal or drought, they switch to another crop.”The survey shows that 35.8 percent of the households surveyed were aware of climate change. Across all three geographical domains, the number of households unaware of climate change is significantly high, with the highest number being in the mountain region (70.9 percent). The sex-disaggregated data indicate that most male (61.3 precent) and female (74 percent) respondents were unaware of climate change impacts.The accessibility of early warning information among the people is weak.In urban municipalities, 16.3 percent of households received early-warning information, while 83.7 percent of the respondents did not receive any information regarding a disaster occurring shortly. Altitude-wise, households in low-altitude regions have received more early-warning information than those in the higher-altitude areas. The survey results show a significant impact of climate change on Nepal's water resources over the last 25 years. Climate change has notable implications for the country's energy transition, as it is actively pursuing a shift from conventional fossil fuels to renewable and sustainable energy sources. According to experts, the survey report is eye-opening. Nepal plans to generate 30,000MW of electricity by 2035, and the market for Nepal's hydropower is opening up in India and Bangladesh.Many households reported adverse changes and noted their water resources dried up. This phenomenon was observed across all domains and indicates a nationwide decrease in water availability. Respondents experienced a reduction in ground and surface water, primarily attributed to insufficient rainfall and increased drought incidents. According to the survey, 78.3 percent of households observed a decline in rivulets and streams, and 55 percent observed a decrease in wells, springs, and stone spouts. Likewise, 47.7 percent observed changes in water resources due to insufficient rainfall, followed by an increase in drought (20.3 percent), road construction (3.4 percent), deforestation and urbanisation (3.2 percent). In contrast, minimal respondents observed change due to population growth, earthquakes and landslides/soil erosion over the last 25 years.The survey said that over the past 25 years, Nepal has suffered from various natural disasters. Drought has emerged as a major disaster, affecting 44.87 percent households, and floods 13.87 percent. Storms have affected 9.9 percent of households, while landslides have affected 7.81 percent. Drought has been reported as the major disaster, affecting 65.4 percent of households, followed by diseases/insects at 54.3 percent, storms 46.2 percent, hailstorms 32.6 percent, floods 28.5 percent, cold waves 21.7 percent, landslides 21.5 percent, and inundation 17.5 percent. Thunderstorms impacted 15.7 percent of households, while occurrences of other disasters such as avalanches, GLOFs, and snowstorms were relatively lower. Climate change has significant and wide-ranging impacts on biodiversity in Nepal, a country known for its rich and diverse ecosystems, including the Himalayan mountains, tropical forests, and wetlands. Ten percent of households reported changes in flowering and fruiting behaviours affecting trees, shrubs, and fruiting plants, leading to reduced production and altered taste. Some of the critical impacts of climate change on biodiversity in Nepal are shifts in species distribution, habitat loss and fragmentation, altered breeding and migration patterns, invasive species, loss of endemic species, biodiversity conservation challenges, and human-wildlife conflict.  ","summary":"Climate change has profound impacts on Nepal’s economy, particularly on agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity, according to the latest survey report.The National Climate Change Survey 2022, the second of its kind, was released by the National Statistics Office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics.

If some individuals are involved in misdeeds, they will automatically come under its scanner,” Mahesh Bartaula, CPN-UML chief whip who is also a member of the Giri-led panel, told the Post.“Our refusal to form a committee specifically to investigate Rabi Lamichhane is not about protecting him, but about avoiding setting a precedent of forming committees targeting an individual.”The ruling party leaders present in the meeting claimed that though no agreement was reached, the Congress had softened its stance during Thursday’s meeting compared to the past. Bartuala said they hope for a breakthrough on Friday.The meeting of the ToR drafting committee has been slated for 8:30 am on Friday, hours before the meeting of the House of Representatives. The Congress leaders, however, refuse to accept that they have softened their stance. They say the investigation against Lamichhane is their bottom line. “There has been no progress so far. However, we are open to discussions,” Ramesh Lekhak, the Congress chief whip, told the Post. “Let’s see what happens tomorrow [Friday].” In the meeting, the ruling party lawmakers had agreed to list out the names of the cooperatives which provided money to the Gorkha Media, for the investigation but without mentioning Lamichhane’s name. They had said they can list out Surya Darshan Cooperative of Pokhara, Sahara Cooperative of Chitwan, Birgunj’s Sano Paila Cooperative and Supreme Cooperative of Butwal in the broader investigation. However, they in return demanded that the probe committee be allowed to dig up possible misuse of deposits in the cooperatives that have been declared crisis-ridden.

In the past three meetings, the Speaker has been pushing ahead the House business using marshals to contain the protest by Congress lawmakers. Endorsement of the policies and programmes is necessary before presenting the national budget for the upcoming fiscal year. There is a constitutional obligation to present the budget on Tuesday.However, if the Congress continues its protest, the government may opt to bring the budget through ordinance instead of presenting budget-related bills in Parliament. “We want to present the budget in the House, but it all depends on whether the opposition parties will allow it,” said Bartaula. “Ordinance will be our last resort.”  ","summary":"The ruling and opposition parties have yet again failed to finalise the terms of reference (ToR) for the proposed parliamentary panel to investigate the multi-billion-rupee cooperative scam.A meeting of the four-member panel led by Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri on Thursday could not agree on the ToR as they remain sharply divided on whether to mention the name of Rabi Lamichhane, deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs, in the ToR.The four-member panel was formed on May 18 after an agreement among the top leaders of the major parties to constitute the parliamentary committee to investigate the issue.As in the previous meetings, the Nepali Congress was firm on its demand that the investigation against Lamichhane, in the capacity as then managing director of Gorkha Media Network, where the money from four different cooperatives was injected, should be the focus of the probe panel.The ruling parties on the other hand wanted a committee to probe the problems facing the entire cooperatives sector including those with links to Lamichhane—but without specifically naming the deputy prime minister, who also is the chair of Rastriya Swatantra Party.“It is clear that investigation of cases, not an individual, should be the focus of the parliamentary committee.

In the past three meetings, the Speaker has been pushing ahead the House business using marshals to contain the protest by Congress lawmakers. Endorsement of the policies and programmes is necessary before presenting the national budget for the upcoming fiscal year. There is a constitutional obligation to present the budget on Tuesday.However, if the Congress continues its protest, the government may opt to bring the budget through ordinance instead of presenting budget-related bills in Parliament. “We want to present the budget in the House, but it all depends on whether the opposition parties will allow it,” said Bartaula. “Ordinance will be our last resort.”  "},{"hash":"4e71c362ca71680b7428f41d4eefc20e1b9f000d41c12c4a753be921142ff8db","title":"congress-vows-to-toughen-stance-on-home-minister-investigation","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/05/23/congress-vows-to-toughen-stance-on-home-minister-investigation","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/protest-1716424969.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1716422400000,"source":"kp","category":"politics","content":"The main opposition, Nepali Congress, has announced protests against the government, specifically targeting Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, who faces charges of misuse of cooperative funds.“A joint meeting of the congress central working committee and parliamentary party on Wednesday decided to hold demonstrations starting Sunday demanding a parliamentary investigation against Lamichhane, who is accused of embezzling millions of rupees from credit cooperatives in Butwal, Pokhara and Chitwan,” said Nepali Congress spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat after the meeting.The party has also instructed its sister organisations to organise protests against the “government’s protection of the cooperative fraudsters” starting Friday and expand these protests and demonstrations at the local level.“The way the home minister presented himself against Nepali Congress leaders and issued a veiled threat against some Congress leaders including General Secretary Gagan Thapa and others has made us serious,” an office bearer of the party told the Post.Over two dozen central working committee members as well as lawmakers spoke at the Wednesday meeting.“The government forced a confidence vote [in Parliament] by muzzling the main opposition and other opposition parties,” a statement issued by the party said. “It shows the government is trying to invite confrontation in the House, bypass the parliamentary process, evade questions, silence the opposition parties as well as the voices of cooperatives’ victims.”“On the one hand, the ruling parties have disrupted the process of discussions on crucial issues including policy corruption, people’s livelihoods, development plans and budgetary issues, plus lawmaking, and on the other hand they have also colluded to remain silent on several issues in which they are involved.”And outside Parliament, the government is trying to silence those who question it by putting pressure on and influencing them. Unconstitutional and undemocratic moves were made in the provinces through province heads, reads the statement. “We condemn such tendencies of the government. It is our conclusion that the government is becoming irresponsible, illiberal, arbitrary, undemocratic and totalitarian. Nepali Congress deplores such tendencies and has decided to oppose them resolutely in the federal parliament and provincial assemblies and out in the streets,” said the party’s statement. The Congress office bearer said that the home minister’s unsubstantiated accusations against Congress leaders was intolerable. “Time has come to show the party’s strength in the house as well as in the streets.”The party also took exception to the arrest of Kailash Sirohiya, chairman of the Kantipur Media Group (KMG), and concluded that it was an attempt to muzzle the Nepali press and threaten its very existence. A team of Nepal Police on Tuesday arrested Sirohiya from his office on the charge of forging citizenship documents. He is currently under judicial custody in Dhanusha, Janakpur.During the meeting, according to the multiple Nepali Congress leaders, several leaders and lawmakers demanded the resignation of the home minister, concluding that the government is increasingly marching on a totalitarian path. “Now onwards, the Congress should make the home minister’s resignation its single agenda and stand resolutely for it,” said a Congress office bearer. “Then the party should call for the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate Lamichhane and should not stop its protest until the government agrees to its demand.”Although the major political parties were ready to form the parliamentary panel and also constituted a task force, disagreements over its terms of reference stalled the process. Congress spokesman Mahat said provincial and district committees of the party will announce their separate protest programmes against the government and home minister.“Until now, we have been calling for a parliamentary probe against the home minister. But this is no longer just about Rabi Lamichhane, as the alliance is trying to weaken the constitution. In such a situation, the Nepali Congress will not remain a bystander,” Mahat said after the meeting.The arrest of Kantipur Chairman Kailash Sirohiya was widely discussed in the meeting, and almost all central working committee members condemned it. The meeting also denounced the government’s attempts to muzzle the media and terrorise journalists. “We deplore such activities of the government and demand a free and fair environment for the media,” the party said in its statement.“The government is duping citizens, protecting criminals and attacking the constitution, democracy and democratic values, and it is headed towards authoritarianism. The meeting also called for justice for millions of cooperative victims, formation of a parliamentary probe committee against the home minister and urged the government to take action against those involved in the cooperative scam,” said Mahat.“The way the home administration presented itself while arresting Sirohiya from his own office was totally a vendetta,” said Mahat. “We deplore the arbitrary arrest, which was motivated by a series of news published by Kantipur in favour of the cooperative victims.”Besides criticising the role and activities of the home minister and the government, some lawmakers also came down hard on the role of Speaker Devraj Ghimire. Despite obstruction from the Nepali Congress, Speaker Ghimire had started the House session to allow the Prime Minister Dahal to seek a trust vote on Monday. “To ask for justice for 75,000 cooperative victims and in order to ensure the return of their deposits, the party has decided to voice its concerns in the street and in Parliament,” said Ajay Babu Siwakoti, a central working committee member. “We will expand such protests at the provincial and local levels.Besides Siwakoti, Nain Singh Mahar and several other central working committee members also were firm on their demand for the home minister’s resignation. “It is no longer a question of just probing the home minister. Now, he must resign,” said Mahar. He labelled the decision to arrest the KMG chairman as being motivated by “vendetta and revenge, which means the home minister no longer has any moral right to remain in the position.” “The way Sirohiya was arrested, the government was clearly intent on exacting revenge against him,” said Chanda Chaurhary. “The home minister used to say that he will put Sirohiya behind bars for at least a day and now he has got his wish.” “The citizenship issue is just a pretext to take revenge against him,” she added.Dila Sangraula termed the home minister’s statement in the House as ‘violent’ and ‘uncivilised’ and said he should resign. “Now the Nepali Congress should also raise the issue of Giribandhu tea estate land scam,” she said.

As per their agreement, a four-member committee led by Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri, who also is a CPN-UML leader, was formed to finalise the terms of reference (ToR) for the parliamentary probe. The committee also includes Jeevan Pariyar from the Congress, Mahesh Bartaula of the UML, and Shishir Khanal of the RSP. However, marathon meetings by the Giri-led panel starting Sunday morning could not agree on the ToR as the ruling parties stuck to their guns. The main opposition insisted that the investigation against Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, in the capacity as then managing director of Gorkha Media Network, where the money from four different cooperatives was injected, should be the primary focus of the probe panel. The ruling parties on the other hand wanted a committee to probe the problems facing the entire cooperatives sector including those with links to Lamichhane—but without specifically naming the deputy prime minister, who also is the RSP chair.“We don’t want the committee just for the sake of forming one. It needs to investigate what we are pressing for,” said Ramesh Lekhak, Nepali Congress chief whip. “The ruling parties want a probe panel with a broader objective, without investigating the home minister.” The ruling party leaders, however, say the Congress wants to form the committee with the objective of implicating a particular person (Lamichhane). “The sole objective of the Congress is to target an individual, which is not acceptable. Their demand has nothing to do with resolving the problems in the cooperative sector but only with implicating the home minister,” said the UML’s Bartaula.RSP leaders say they were even flexible about including (Lamichhane-linked) Surya Darshan Cooperative of Pokhara, Sahara Cooperative of Chitwan and Supreme Cooperative of Butwal in the broader investigation, but only if the Congress agrees to allow the probe committee to dig up possible misuse of deposits in the cooperatives that have been declared crisis-ridden. “However, the Congress leaders didn’t agree. They backtracked from Saturday's agreement,” said the RSP’s Khanal. As the parties were in negotiations to finalise the ToR, a meeting of the House of Representatives called for 11 in the morning was postponed to 2 pm, which was again postponed to 4 pm. With no agreement in sight, the House meeting finally commenced at 6 in the evening with the single agenda of allowing Lamichhane to clarify the accusations against him.A meeting of the opposition parties held earlier in the morning had agreed to allow the home minister to answer questions raised against him, a chance he had long been asking for. The meeting called by the Congress was attended by the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. The opposition parties, particularly the Congress, which had been barring Lamichhane from addressing the House and presenting bills, had agreed to allow him to clarify the matter. Addressing the House after more than two months, Lamichhane not only defended himself, but also launched a personal attacks on several Congress leaders. Daring anyone to present concrete evidence of fraud, he said, “I challenge anyone to show evidence that any decision was made to acquire a loan from cooperatives, that I submitted any loan applications or signatures during the loan process, or that any funds were deposited into my account during my tenure at Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd.” He claimed that fake loan statements were prepared in the cooperatives in his name, for which he is not responsible. “I haven’t signed any documents nor have I been on their boards or served in official capacity in any of the cooperatives. Never ever did the Gorkha Media decide to take loans from cooperatives,” he said. “I am not responsible to clear the filth created by [then Gorkha Media chair] GB Rai.” He said he has been hounded based on the sensational media headlines targeting him. Lamichhane also lashed out at the Nepali Congress, revealing that the party had offered him the prime ministerial position for a term of a year and a half. He questioned the party's moral stance, wondering why they considered him unfit for the role of home minister yet found him suitable for prime minister.“If I am ineligible to serve as home minister, with what moral justification do I assume the post of prime minister? I wish to raise this question in the House today. Is the offer for the prime ministerial position still valid, or has it lapsed?” said Lamichhane.He asked if the Congress was ready to constitute a probe panel against everyone the media has linked with corruption. Without naming Gagan Thapa, the Congress general secretary, Lamichhane accused him of selling the country's secret information to foreigners. Citing media reports, he also claimed that Thapa had embezzled millions of rupees in the name of constructing a park at Tri-Chandra College and had misused agricultural grants. He also asked whether the main opposition would want a probe panel against those who have been accused of grabbing the land of Bansbari Leather and Shoe Factory, illegally registering public land in Tikapur under individuals’ name, and stealing luxury watches, or selling diplomatic passports. “Not just those who hold two or three citizenship, the agents and assets of the foreigners who hold one citizenship and one passport but sell the country’s secret information must be ousted as the lawmaker,” he said.In response, the Congress leaders said Lamichhane was rattled by the demands to investigate him. Holding a press meet after the House meeting, Congress leader Thapa said not just Lamichhane but his larger team is also involved in the embezzlement of savings from cooperatives. “It seems they [Lamichhane and other RSP leaders] are trying their luck at running a political party having already operated cooperatives and a media company,” he said. Stating that such committees have been constituted in the past, Thapa said if Ram Sharan Mahat, Bharat Mohan Adhikari or Janardan Sharma can be investigated, why not Lamichhane. He also challenged the home minister to uncover any wrongdoing on his part. “If I am guilty, I need to face legal action. If he is guilty he has to go through the same process,” he said asking Lamichhane why he fears investigations.Thapa challenged the home minister to investigate his entire life, starting from his birth in Prasuti Griha [maternity hospital] in Kathmandu. “Look at the kinds of allegations he [Lamichhane] has levelled against me. I request him: Please form a committee to probe me… Such a committee to probe Gagan Thapa can be formed even within the RSP. Please do it.”Thapa said his party primarily wants an investigation into the embezzlement of money in the cooperatives with Lamichhane’s involvement as they believe that police have been barred from investigating them.“We are clear the House cannot function until a probe committee is formed as per our demand. The vote of trust motion will also not move ahead so long as the committee is not formed,\" said Thapa.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take a vote of trust from the lower house on Monday. However, lack of agreement among the parties has put it into uncertainty. “We will try to agree on the ToR on Monday morning.

Despite multiple meetings and back-channel negotiations on Friday, the ruling and opposition parties failed to narrow down their differences over the formation of the parliamentary panel. Short of an understanding, meetings of both chambers of Parliament were put off until Sunday. While the National Assembly sitting was adjourned due to an obstruction by the main opposition, the House of Representatives meeting was deferred until Sunday through a notice.A senior Rastriya Swatantra Party leader told the Post that the House session was deferred by a day at the request of Nepali Congress leaders and informal talks between the Congress, the RSP and the prime minister were headed in the positive direction.“We do not want to derail the process of forming the parliamentary probe and we also do not want to introduce the budget through an ordinance,” the RSP leader who is engaged in multiple talks with leaders from ruling and opposition sides said. “We do not want to be seen as a destabilising factor.” A Nepali Congress office bearer told the Post that Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s decision to seek a vote of confidence on Monday has made them suspicious. The opposition leaders have smelt a rat after the government’s decision to withdraw the bill related to political parties and frequent changes of the conditions by the ruling parties on the parliamentary probe as well as the resumption of the house session to discuss the government’s policies and programmes and the budget presentation have created suspicion.“Now we are sensing that the government is set to bring the budget through an ordinance if our protest continues,” the Congress official said. The main opposition party is yet to decide whether to obstruct the House on Monday. Prime Minister Dahal has invited senior Nepali Congress leaders for a meeting on Saturday morning. The largest party convened a meeting of opposition parties on Friday. According to Gyanendra Shahi, chief whip of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the parties were one on forming a parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. “But we have also raised the issue that opposition parties should allow Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane to speak in the House and let him clarify his position.”Instead of taking the lead to resolve the deadlock in Parliament, the way the prime minister hurriedly seeks a vote of confidence has made the Nepali Congress suspicious. Prime Minister Dahal has decided to go for a floor test on Monday. He is seeking the vote of confidence of the House after the Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal on May 13 withdrew its support for the government following a split in the party.Some of the prime minister's recent activities did not help resolve the deadline inside the house, Nepali Congress general secretary Gagan Thapa said. The way the prime minister decided to hurriedly seek a vote of confidence and withdraw the bill related to the Political Party Act leads us to suspect that he wants to close the budget session of Parliament and present the budget through an ordinance.The prime minister's meeting with Congress leaders on Friday evening to discuss the latest political situation was deferred till Saturday morning.According to Thapa, the prime minister’s and the CPN-UML’s game plan will result in a loss for the Rastriya Swatantra Party.“Whatever the UML chair says for public consumption, his inner interest is different. The prime minister has his own interests. Finally, the Rastriya Swatantra Party will bear the brunt of these one after another conspiracy. I do not know how seriously the RSP is taking these developments, but if the UML and the Maoist Centre will try to go on a new course, the RSP stands to be impacted a lot,” said Thapa.Thapa said that his party’s position at the moment is to obstruct the House on Monday during the session in which the prime minister goes for a floor test.Suspicions are growing between the ruling and opposition parties over the issue of budget. If the Congress continues to obstruct the House, the ruling parties will go for the budget ordinance. It is up to the Nepali Congress, said Yogesh Bhattarai of the UML.If the Congress continues to obstruct the House, there is no option but to issue the budget through an ordinance.He added that they are hopeful of having positive talks and discussions with the Nepali Congress by Saturday.But the Nepali Congress is adamant on a probe against the home minister for his alleged involvement in Pokhara, Butwal, and Chitwan-based cooperatives. The parliamentary committee is needed to investigate the home minister, Congress spokesman Prakash Sharan Mahat said. Those who are in power and hold positions of authority should not be exempted from investigation.But the RSP has been refusing to form a committee targeting the home minister.“Why is the Nepali Congress only after three cooperatives at a time when 16 cooperatives are in crisis?” said Manish Jha of the RSP.The government has declared 20 cooperative firms as deeply crisis-ridden. The top managers of these cooperatives are either facing police charges or absconding.“Why are you only after three cooperatives?” Jha asked Congress leaders. “Though we cannot probe all 31,000 cooperatives, we can probe those in crisis.” Jha said that Congress leaders have no uniform opinions on how to resolve the cooperative crisis.“It’s been difficult for us to understand whose voice is authoritative in the Nepali Congress. The Congress office bearers have differing positions on forming the parliamentary committee and its terms of reference,” said Jha. “Who do we trust? We have urged the Nepali Congress leaders to come up with an official position on the party’s letterhead.” ","summary":"The widening rift between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to look into the cooperative scam has further complicated the parliamentary process at a time when the government has the compulsion to announce the fiscal budget on May 28. Despite multiple meetings and back-channel negotiations on Friday, the ruling and opposition parties failed to narrow down their differences over the formation of the parliamentary panel. Short of an understanding, meetings of both chambers of Parliament were put off until Sunday. While the National Assembly sitting was adjourned due to an obstruction by the main opposition, the House of Representatives meeting was deferred until Sunday through a notice.A senior Rastriya Swatantra Party leader told the Post that the House session was deferred by a day at the request of Nepali Congress leaders and informal talks between the Congress, the RSP and the prime minister were headed in the positive direction.“We do not want to derail the process of forming the parliamentary probe and we also do not want to introduce the budget through an ordinance,” the RSP leader who is engaged in multiple talks with leaders from ruling and opposition sides said. “We do not want to be seen as a destabilising factor.” A Nepali Congress office bearer told the Post that Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s decision to seek a vote of confidence on Monday has made them suspicious. The opposition leaders have smelt a rat after the government’s decision to withdraw the bill related to political parties and frequent changes of the conditions by the ruling parties on the parliamentary probe as well as the resumption of the house session to discuss the government’s policies and programmes and the budget presentation have created suspicion.“Now we are sensing that the government is set to bring the budget through an ordinance if our protest continues,” the Congress official said. The main opposition party is yet to decide whether to obstruct the House on Monday. Prime Minister Dahal has invited senior Nepali Congress leaders for a meeting on Saturday morning. The largest party convened a meeting of opposition parties on Friday. According to Gyanendra Shahi, chief whip of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the parties were one on forming a parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. “But we have also raised the issue that opposition parties should allow Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane to speak in the House and let him clarify his position.”Instead of taking the lead to resolve the deadlock in Parliament, the way the prime minister hurriedly seeks a vote of confidence has made the Nepali Congress suspicious. Prime Minister Dahal has decided to go for a floor test on Monday. He is seeking the vote of confidence of the House after the Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal on May 13 withdrew its support for the government following a split in the party.Some of the prime minister's recent activities did not help resolve the deadline inside the house, Nepali Congress general secretary Gagan Thapa said. The way the prime minister decided to hurriedly seek a vote of confidence and withdraw the bill related to the Political Party Act leads us to suspect that he wants to close the budget session of Parliament and present the budget through an ordinance.The prime minister's meeting with Congress leaders on Friday evening to discuss the latest political situation was deferred till Saturday morning.According to Thapa, the prime minister’s and the CPN-UML’s game plan will result in a loss for the Rastriya Swatantra Party.“Whatever the UML chair says for public consumption, his inner interest is different.

Ghimire was elected to the House from Jhapa on a UML ticket. Though a lawmaker formally disassociates him/herself from the party, their independence in running the House is often questioned.“Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened today in the House is unfortunate and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.”He also hinted that UML chairman KP Sharma Oli had instigated Thursday’s tensions.

This is considered an epidemic season, in which hundreds of thousands of people get infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases and snakebites.“Over six to eight snakebite victims seek treatment in our hospital daily,” said Dr Bimal Sharma Chalise of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “Number of patients seeking snakebite treatment has gone up after a rise in rainfall activities.”Along with water-borne and vector-borne diseases, snakebites and resulting deaths are common in Nepal during the rainy season.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snake bites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Along with snakebite cases,the number of patients infected with diarrheal ailments, fever and jaundice has also risen in the hospital.“Most of the snakebite victims seeking care at our hospital are either from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from the districts adjoining the Valley,” said Chalise. “Most of the snakebite victims are farmers, women and children who work or play in the fields or go to the jungle to collect fodder for their cattle.”Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health issue usually triggered by food and water safety or hygiene issues. The disease, which has been associated with higher temperatures, is one of Nepal’s leading causes of morbidity and mortality.Doctors at the hospital say around half a dozen diarrheal patients are also seeking treatment every day. Similarly, patients having jaundice and fever due to typhoid are also seeking care at the hospital.Typhoid fever, usually called typhoid, is a highly contagious disease caused by Salmonella typhi, which spreads through contaminated food or water. Studies have shown that the disease can be fatal in up to 10 percent of the reported cases.Typhoid fever has been found throughout the world, but the problem is acute in areas without safe drinking water and sanitation. Nepal has also recorded major typhoid outbreaks in the past, but very few cases have been reported in the last few years.Nepal introduced the typhoid vaccine in the routine vaccination programme in 2022.The Ministry of Health and Population launched a month-long nationwide vaccination campaign against typhoid, during which around seven million children between the ages of 15 months and 15 years were inoculated.“Cases of water-borne diseases and snakebite have started to spike of late,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Hospital. “We should all be cautious about the food and water we eat and drink. We must ensure that food and water is safe before eating.”Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive against the risks. They say that people living in thatched-roof houses are also highly vulnerable to snakebite, as snakes visit such homes in search of rats. They say that people should be asked to keep their houses and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in the bush, avoid walking at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.“Most of the water resources get contaminated during monsoon season, as rainwater gets mixed in the water resources,” Pun said.

However, vegetable prices, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI)-weighted basis, are up 16.99 percent in mid-April, after rising by 14.07 percent in mid-March.“As Nepal is dependent on vegetable products from India like onion, potato, and lemon, as well as other green vegetables to fulfil the demand, certain changes in export policy by the Indian government affect the prices here,” said Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetables Market Development Board.India restricted the export of onion for a few months and also introduced export duty and minimum export price and these drove up onion prices and contributed to inflation in this major kitchen staple, Shrestha said.The price of a kilo of onion nearly doubled to Rs200 in retail in the Nepali market from Rs120 per kilo after India’s export ban in December last year.Vegetable traders said that as the government imposed tax on potatoes, onions and other vegetables, as well as fruits and food items, it also contributed to vegetable inflation this year.Potatoes, onions and other daily consumable farm products are exempt from VAT under the Value Added Tax Act of 1996. But this fiscal year the government amended the law through the Financial Bill 2023, removing 170 goods from the tax-free list.Taxes totalling 23.5 percent are charged on potatoes, onions and other vegetables, fruits and food items—9 percent agriculture service charge, 1.5 percent advance tax and 13 percent VAT.The climate factor plays a major role in the production of vegetables as the agriculture system in the country is dependent on rainfall due to insufficient irrigation system, traders said.The less than average rainfall for a prolonged period impacted winter and rainy season vegetable production, Shrestha said.The price rise in other inputs like fertiliser, seeds, labour and agricultural equipment have also directly affected vegetable prices, Shrestha said. The price of all the agricultural inputs has increased in recent times, he said.Labour shortages in farm areas, especially in rural areas, have hit production as youths are leaving the country as migrant workers, severely impacting production, Shrestha said.The price of essential kitchen staples like tomato, potato and onion has increased within a month.According to the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, the wholesale price of local small tomatoes has increased by 62.63 percent within a month to Rs45 per kg on Tuesday, while Indian tomatoes saw an increase of 2.57 percent, and now costs Rs66.67 per kg. Also, the price of tomato small (tarai) has increased by 11.11 percent to Rs50 per kg. The price of tomato big (Nepali) has declined by 30.77 percent to Rs45 per kg.The wholesale price of potato red has increased by 14.54 percent within a month to Rs54.60 per kg while the price of potato (white) increased by 19.23 percent to Rs46.50 per kg. The price of potato red (Indian) has fallen marginally by 1.41 percent to Rs47 per kg.The wholesale price of onion dry (Indian) has increased by 22.65 percent to Rs83 per kg within a month.On May 4, India lifted the ban on onion export after nearly five months but imposed a minimum export tariff of $550 per tonne.The wholesale price of other vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, eggplant, green peas, bottle gourd, squash, green vegetables, chilli, green coriander and garlic have gone up within a month.The wholesale price of cabbage increased by 22.44 percent to Rs40 per kg and cauliflower by 2.57 percent to Rs66.67 per kg within a month. Eggplant became dearer by 40 percent to Rs35 per kg in a month.Green peas became expensive by 100 percent to Rs170 per kg during the review period while bottle gourd price went up by 57.14 percent to Rs55 per kg.Similarly, the price of squash increased by 20 percent to Rs30 per kg in a month. The price of green leafy vegetables like spinach and cress increased by 17.34 percent to Rs146.67 per kg within a month.The wholesale price of broccoli increased by 72.73 percent to Rs95 per kg.The wholesale price of chilli increased by 54.55 percent to Rs85 per kg while garlic dry (Nepali) price increased by 22.58 percent to Rs190 per kg within a month.Although it is the rainy season and peak vegetable season, prices have not dropped due to low rainfall, which has affected production, Shrestha said. Both the production and timely arrival of vegetables have suffered from lack of rain, leading to higher prices, he said.“Kalimati fruits and vegetable market used to receive 700-800 tonnes of vegetables daily during this season in past years, but now we are receiving 600-700 tonnes.

The number of patients suffering from respiratory illnesses—pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, among others—has risen significantly not only in this hospital but those across the country, according to health officials. “Polluted air is the chief culprit for the rapid surge in the number of respiratory illnesses,” said Dr Niraj Bam, an associate professor at the Institute of Medicine, Tribhuvan University. “Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke.”Of late, polluted air has been taking a huge toll on public health, throughout the globe.A new report published on Thursday in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal, states that polluted air and high blood pressure are leading contributors to the global disease burden. The report, “Global Burden and Strength of Evidence for 88 Risk Factors in 204 Countries and 811 Subnational Locations, 1990–2021: A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021,” shows that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent).Likewise, smoking accounted for 5.7 percent, low birth weight and short gestation 5.6 percent and diabetes 5.4 percent of the burden.Low birth weight, short gestation and unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing (WaSH) were among the leading risk factors for the younger population up to 14 years, while for older age groups, metabolic risks such as high blood pressure, high body mass index (BMI), high blood sugar and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol had a greater impact.Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year, and the capital city often becomes the world’s most polluted metropolis. Doctors say particulate matter emitted from construction sites, wildfires, wood burning, agriculture activities, and dusty roads worsens air quality, threatening the health of hundreds of thousands of people across the country.Most forests burn every year during the dry season. Vehicular and industrial emissions and the burning of agricultural residue make the air toxic.A recent report by Save the Children also shows critical linkages between air pollution and multi-faceted hazards for children.The report “Breathless Future: Unveiling the Impacts of Air Pollution on Children and Women in Kathmandu and Saptari” shows the systemic impact of air pollution on various aspects of children's lives. It also explores the effects of air pollution on women and underrepresented groups.“Deteriorating air quality, outdoors and indoors, has exposed children and women to many health hazards—asthma, other lung conditions, coughing, skin disease, nausea, and headache,” reads the report. “Alarmingly, these conditions have led to increased cases of pregnancy loss, child organ underdevelopment, and a general decline in life expectancy.”Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively.The reduction in life expectancy depends on where one lives—7.5 years in Mahottari, 7.4 years in Rautahat and Dhanusha, and 7.2 years in Sarlahi and Bara districts, the AQLI report said. Likewise, the pollution has been shaving 6.7 years off the lives of people residing in Siraha, and 6.2 years in Saptari and Rupandehi districts.Environment experts in Nepal said that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development. Polluted air has for long been taking a huge toll on public health in Nepal but what’s alarming is that the authorities have not taken the issue seriously.“We heard the government’s policies and programmes.

Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff.

They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many?

No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se.

Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution.

During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time.

It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. ","summary":"Serene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally.

Na, na, na, na, na!” The crowd sang along.On a day Liverpool fans had been dreading since Klopp announced in late-January he would leave at season’s end, the manager sounded genuinely happy rather than heartbroken.“It doesn’t feel like an end. It just feels like the start, because I saw today a football team playing full of talent, youth, creativity, desire, greed,” he said.“In these few weeks where I have had too much attention, I realised a lot of things. People say I turned them from doubters into believers. That’s not true.“I just said we have to. You did it. Nobody tells you to stop believing. This club is in a better moment than a long time. We have this wonderful stadium, training centre and you — the superpower of world football. Wow.”Klopp’s team, who were on course to give their manager a fairytale ending before a string of bad results last month derailed their title challenge, finished the season third in the table on 82 points, nine behind winners Manchester City and seven behind second-placed Arsenal.Klopp bade farewell to the Anfield faithful having won 305 matches, including penalty shootouts, since joining the Reds in 2015, plus seven trophies including the Champions League in 2019 and a first English League title in three decades in 2020.But he was loved as much for his charisma and passion as his on-field success and it was on full display on Sunday. He was saluted with a guard of honour in the post-game celebrations, and after pausing to wrap an emotional captain Virgil van Dijk in a bear hug, he turned and ran through it again.“It’s a very emotional day,” Van Dijk told Sky Sports. “(Klopp) deserves every bit of love that he’s getting.”Tears rolled down defender Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cheeks while the team stood arm-in-arm and the fans serenaded them with “You’ll Never Walk Alone.”“I’ve never seen or experienced someone who can inspire or motivate with a click of his fingers,” Alexander-Arnold told Sky. “If he told me today it was snowing outside, I’d believe him—that’s probably the best way of putting it.”Klopp famously introduced himself as “the normal one” in his first Liverpool press conference after his hiring, “but he’s definitely a special one for us for the players who played under his leadership,” the team’s Brazilian keeper Alisson Becker said.“His passion, his desire to win things, to achieve things... but he thinks about the personal side also, he wanted to do everything to make the players feel good to play for his team. I have so many good memories.”While Klopp’s departure announcement sent shock waves through the football world, the manager said he felt a sense of relief around his decision. His energy for the job was waning, he said. He could not do it on “three wheels.”He looks forward, he told Sunday’s crowd, to throwing his energy into being a fan.“Obviously I saw a lot of people crying and I will tonight too because I will miss people but change is good,” he said.“You welcome the new manager like you welcomed me. You go all in from the first day. You keep believing. You push the team. I’m one of you now. I love you to bits.”And before the final curtain came down on his time with the Merseyside club, Klopp ran the length of the Anfield pitch for one final round of fist pumps with the crowd, and then pointed with two thumbs to the back of his shirt, which read: “I’ll never walk alone again.” ","summary":"Moments after the final whistle blew on Juergen Klopp’s managerial career at Liverpool, the much-loved German encouraged the Anfield faithful to celebrate the moment, but embrace the future.Klopp flashed his huge smile throughout a long address to fans after Liverpool’s 2-0 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers in Sunday’s emotional Premier League season finale, and even led the crowd in a song for incoming manager Arne Slot, who has enormous shoes to fill.“Change is good,” the 56-year-old Klopp told the crowd. “And you never know exactly what to expect, but if you go with the right attitude into that, then everything will be fine.“What I want you to sing, I have an idea,” he added, then launched loudly into: “Arne Slot! Na, na, na, na, na!” The crowd sang along.On a day Liverpool fans had been dreading since Klopp announced in late-January he would leave at season’s end, the manager sounded genuinely happy rather than heartbroken.“It doesn’t feel like an end. It just feels like the start, because I saw today a football team playing full of talent, youth, creativity, desire, greed,” he said.“In these few weeks where I have had too much attention, I realised a lot of things. People say I turned them from doubters into believers. That’s not true.“I just said we have to. You did it. Nobody tells you to stop believing. This club is in a better moment than a long time. We have this wonderful stadium, training centre and you — the superpower of world football. Wow.”Klopp’s team, who were on course to give their manager a fairytale ending before a string of bad results last month derailed their title challenge, finished the season third in the table on 82 points, nine behind winners Manchester City and seven behind second-placed Arsenal.Klopp bade farewell to the Anfield faithful having won 305 matches, including penalty shootouts, since joining the Reds in 2015, plus seven trophies including the Champions League in 2019 and a first English League title in three decades in 2020.But he was loved as much for his charisma and passion as his on-field success and it was on full display on Sunday. He was saluted with a guard of honour in the post-game celebrations, and after pausing to wrap an emotional captain Virgil van Dijk in a bear hug, he turned and ran through it again.“It’s a very emotional day,” Van Dijk told Sky Sports. “(Klopp) deserves every bit of love that he’s getting.”Tears rolled down defender Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cheeks while the team stood arm-in-arm and the fans serenaded them with “You’ll Never Walk Alone.”“I’ve never seen or experienced someone who can inspire or motivate with a click of his fingers,” Alexander-Arnold told Sky. “If he told me today it was snowing outside, I’d believe him—that’s probably the best way of putting it.”Klopp famously introduced himself as “the normal one” in his first Liverpool press conference after his hiring, “but he’s definitely a special one for us for the players who played under his leadership,” the team’s Brazilian keeper Alisson Becker said.“His passion, his desire to win things, to achieve things... but he thinks about the personal side also, he wanted to do everything to make the players feel good to play for his team. I have so many good memories.”While Klopp’s departure announcement sent shock waves through the football world, the manager said he felt a sense of relief around his decision. His energy for the job was waning, he said. He could not do it on “three wheels.”He looks forward, he told Sunday’s crowd, to throwing his energy into being a fan.“Obviously I saw a lot of people crying and I will tonight too because I will miss people but change is good,” he said.“You welcome the new manager like you welcomed me. You go all in from the first day. You keep believing. You push the team. I’m one of you now. I love you to bits.”And before the final curtain came down on his time with the Merseyside club, Klopp ran the length of the Anfield pitch for one final round of fist pumps with the crowd, and then pointed with two thumbs to the back of his shirt, which read: “I’ll never walk alone again.” "},{"hash":"bc787c486736e6d4631a9aa71eedec093e5c16a898ffd373e1f1f14d67f3e344","title":"guardiola-s-demand-for-perfection-fuels-manchester-city-hunger","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/football/2024/05/20/guardiola-s-demand-for-perfection-fuels-manchester-city-hunger","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/world/httpscloudfrontuseast2imagesarcpublishingcomreuters752OORJFLVK4JCNWXE535IM4A4-1716175916.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1716163200000,"source":"kp","category":"football","content":"Manchester City’s insatiable appetite for trophies spells bad news for any club hoping to break the stranglehold Pep Guardiola’s side continue to have on English football.Admirably, Arsenal pushed them very close this season but once again the sight of Guardiola’s players cavorting with the Premier League trophy was the abiding image of the final day.City’s 3-1 victory over West Ham United on Sunday took them to a place not even the great Liverpool side of the 1980s and Manchester United team of the late 1990s and 2000s inhabited.A fourth successive English league title is unprecedented and the big question is who will stop the City march.They have averaged 89.7 points in their last four title-winning seasons and, while Guardiola’s side again failed to threaten the 100 they amassed in 2017-2018, City proved that when the pressure is really on they are almost impregnable.Arsenal and Liverpool both headed City in the standings in the final months of the campaign, but the champions put together a blistering run of 19 wins and four draws since their last league defeat by Aston Villa on December 6.No one was really surprised because in 53-year-old Guardiola City have a manager obsessed with perfection.“It’s a bit demanding at times.

After Rafah became a target as well, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled the city.So far, fighting has taken place on Rafah’s southern edge and eastern districts, away from the most populated areas.Friday’s ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), or World Court, is binding but its rulings have been ignored in the past, as the court has no enforcement powers.Israeli officials said on Saturday that the World Court's order does not rule out all military action in the area.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. ","summary":"Bharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village.

The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  ","summary":"Gyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while.

That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  "},{"hash":"ab3e899a852db54e8c5b5cd01d987219c2aaba175062fc2a7b5c26ed1e2cbbdc","title":"dissecting-phd-sagas-iii","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/05/23/dissecting-phd-sagas-iii","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/LeadShutterstock2-1716476435.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1716422400000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"In the first instalment of this column published four weeks ago, I argued that institutionalising the requirement of already published research articles as part of the application package to enter PhD programmes works as a barrier to entry for potential applicants. In the second instalment published two weeks ago, I argued that although the “PhD by coursework” modality was the right approach, current staff shortages and the lack of teaching competence and teamwork at Tribhuvan University (TU) resulted in poor delivery of coursework for doctoral students. Although I used TU as an example, the same argument applies to all Nepali universities that have adopted the “PhD by coursework” modality. In this piece, I point out that Nepali universities dispensing PhDs in the social sciences and humanities must put more emphasis on academic writing training than it does now. Multiple requirementsOver the past decades, the requirements for a PhD in Nepali universities in the above-mentioned disciplines have become multiple. While there are some variations, once students register for PhD programmes at most universities in Nepal, they face a package of requirements. Apart from regular coursework (when required), they are expected to attend methodology workshops, write their dissertation proposals and defend them, write a literature review essay, write and present seminar papers, attend conferences, publish papers based on their research and defend their dissertations, all before they are awarded their degrees. In theory, these activities are required so that the PhD students learn important aspects of the research/academic trade as part of their training. These activities are also required, so the logic goes, to produce better quality PhD dissertations. But are these requirements really working?Take, for instance, the case of workshops on methods. Former professor of history at TU, Tri Ratna Manandhar, registered for his PhD at TU in 1978. Early on, he was required to attend a workshop on methods. In a 2021 memoir essay, he recalled that some PhD holders showed up for the seminar and delivered lectures, which he found useless. About 30 years later, Tika Ram Gautam registered for his PhD in Sociology at TU. In an article published in 2021, Gautam says that the mandatory research methodology workshop for registered PhD candidates “turned out to be a mere formality.” In other words, over the span of three decades, the methods workshop delivered to PhD students at TU have not worked for them. On the other hand, Gautam writes that he found the experience of writing a seminar paper under his supervisor Chaitanya Mishra’s guidance really helpful. So obviously this is a more useful activity for doctoral students, provided they can work directly with supervisors with good writing experiences. However, he adds that despite the various requirements, most PhD “students are at a loss when it comes to writing, structuring, and sequencing [dissertation] chapters…. Similarly, candidates are also unable to explain their core argument which forms their thesis.” I have seen plenty of evidence to support Gautam’s evaluation in the form of articles submitted to workshops and journals by PhD students from Nepali universities. Hence, although I agree that the various requirements institutionalised in recent years are needed as part of good doctoral training packages, if the resulting dissertations and derivative articles written by our PhD students are very weak academically, then I think we need to invest more in making their writing training more effective. Perhaps some of the other requirements need to be scaled down to accommodate this increased investment in writing.Delivering writing trainingIs such writing training delivery possible in our universities? For that to happen, various constituents must make some broad decisions. First of all, we will need a general agreement among those who run PhD programmes that learning to write academically is the most fundamental skill their students must accomplish during their doctoral training. Amina Singh, who has taught at Kathmandu University, emphasises (in an email) that this agreement is necessary because “‘writing’ is not necessarily regarded as a scholarly practice that needs to be taught in our universities.” She adds that such writing training should help the students to “write to generate ideas and put forward arguments” as part of knowledge production. The sessions should not be reduced to English language lessons as is the case now. Second, we need a general acknowledgement of the fact that there are various ways of writing academically. Hence, the student training regimes will have to include a diversity of styles. As Singh puts it, there is “very little discussion on the rhetorical approaches to writing research across different disciplines” in our universities. Students need to be offered not rigid ideas about what counts as academic writing but be introduced to “diverse rhetorical styles of writing” that are in practice in academia internationally.Third, structural incentives must be provided to faculty members who want to deliver such writing training. At the moment, as Singh puts it, there “is little incentive for faculty to actually put in the needed work to really support the students in their writing.” This would have to change. One way to do that is to allow existing faculty to offer writing-intensive supplements tied to their regular courses with concomitant adjustments in their annual workload. Another would be to hire faculty (including videshis) whose main job is to teach academic writing. Fourth, students will have to change their relationship with writing. Even if they have enrolled in PhD programmes with no ambition to pursue academic research in the long run, they must recognise that learning to write rigorously will benefit them in various other professions. Finally, we need to consider the modalities of what such an effort might entail. I have already written about this earlier (“On training to write academically”, 24 November 2023). But Amina Singh has provided some additional useful ideas. Writing can be taught, she adds, by “setting up communities of practice for scholars and assigning formal ‘coordinators’ who would design regular activities, workshops, peer learning forums, etc.” She adds, “There needs to be workshops designed with specific stages of the research process in mind and this will require a group of dedicated practicing and skilled faculty who can do the work. For instance, writing a literature review would require a set of different academic literacy skills: Reading, analysis, abstraction, drawing inferences, organizing and presenting ideas in a coherent manner in writing.” She adds that when students start writing their analytical chapters, they might require additional discipline-specific training. It should be mandatory for students to attend these writing workshops. They should use these opportunities to generate content that could be considered first drafts of various components of their dissertations. Needless to say, for this kind of rigorous work to be realised, many of the faculty members and PhD supervisors will have to reinvent themselves as academics who care deeply about their students’ written outputs.Without good coursework components and commitment to providing training in academic writing, Nepali universities will continue to shortchange our doctoral students. They deserve better.

This is not an abstract measure. For some countries in the region, it quite literally means disappearing into the ocean. Humanity cannot afford any SDG complacency and least of all climate complacency. With densely populated coasts, heavy dependence on agriculture, poverty that still afflicts millions, and temperatures rising twice as fast as the global average, this is the most vulnerable region to climate change. Between 2000 and 2023, over 1600 floods devastated the Asia Pacific region, killing more than 88,000 people, and impacting 1.6 billion. They represent 91 percent of all people affected by severe flooding globally. Counting the economic losses it is a staggering 452 billion dollars.By 2050, this region risks losing one-third of its GDP to climate change. And with over 4.3 billion people reliant on this region growing sustainable economies, this means climate investments are needed at greater speed and scale. As it currently stands, the Asia Pacific region faces a significant shortfall in climate financing: at least 800 billion dollars annually.With public finances depleted by the Covid-19 pandemic and other simultaneous shocks, it is evident that it will take the unleashing and directing of more private capital to help fight climate change. Public finance, both domestic and international, must still play that critical role to incentivize, de-risk and hence leverage private finance. Globally, nature-positive solutions can create an annual 10-trillion-dollar investment opportunity and close to 400 million new jobs by 2030. The vast majority of these opportunities sit in Asia. By contrast, according to the Climate Policy Initiative, staying on our current trajectory would trigger projected global losses of 2.3 quadrillion dollars by 2100. Meeting the 1.5 degrees Celsius target of the Paris Climate Agreement would save four-fifths of that amount. The math is clear: green investments support not only people and planet, but also, prosperity. However, turning heavily laden massive industries, hard-to-abate sectors and huge business and political interests around, will take more than doing the math. Encouragingly, some key countries and investors around the world are catching on. Globally, ESG assets are expected to surpass 33.9 trillion dollars by 2026, representing over one-fifth of total assets under management.UNDP is deeply committed to supporting this transformation through four areas of support currently underway with several countries in the region.First, through initiatives like the “Unlocking Private Capital” program and Sustainable Finance Hub, UNDP supports the design of SDG-aligned investment projects, and sustainable debt instruments. Green and Blue Bonds have been taking off in this region, and hopefully the rates and terms improve, so countries benefit more from a green/blue premium.Second, UNDP has developed the SDG Impact Standards, helping businesses and investors worldwide to better incorporate sustainability, the SDGs, and impact management. These standards move beyond just managing ESG risks, to making a net-positive contribution.Third, UNDP has developed SDG Investor Maps highlighting SDG investment opportunity areas in over 40 countries which are used by investors in formulating investment strategies.Fourth, UNDP works with Securities & Exchange Commissions to develop SDG measures and guidance for their listed companies and provide a dedicated platform to track and report on their contributions to the SDGs. Many of these global initiatives have been piloted in China. This includes a successful initiative with the New Development Bank supporting the issuance a 5 billion RMB SDG bond on China’s inter-bank market in 2021. UNDP has also worked with the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors (NAFMII) in China and provided technical assistance to initiate their first trials of social and sustainability bonds. Through the flagship Biodiversity Finance Initiative and support to the Taskforce on Nature Related Financial Disclosure in over 40 countries, UNDP is working to redirect both public and private finance towards activities with nature-positive outcomes. The governments of Shandong and Shanghai have joined us, generating lessons and innovative approaches to advance biodiversity finance around the world.

It identifies the opportunities and challenges of transition in agriculture—a hard-to-abate sector with the least evidence-based research available - towards net-zero paradigms. It also explores financial mechanisms and policy incentives to support the transition, along with growth opportunities, so together they can guide stakeholders to invest at scale. For the private sector, the business case is clear: hundreds of studies have proven that addressing sustainability boosts competitiveness and market share.

The air we inhale for survival is one of the leading causes of illness, as reported by The Lancet, a medical journal. Respiratory diseases like pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have become all too common now. Besides these, ulcers, lung and intestine cancer, kidney diseases, heart problems, and so on are attributed to bad air. The vulnerability of children, women, the elderly and underrepresented groups to air pollution adds to the urgency of its mitigation.The impact of toxic air is particularly harsh on Nepalis as our federal capital, Kathmandu, often tops the list of most polluted cities globally. Only a few weeks ago, Pokhara Metropolitan City’s air was unbreathable for several days. The southern plains met the same fate. This poor air quality has reduced our life expectancy by a staggering 4.6 years, as per the report by the Air Quality Life Index of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. The situation is worse in nine southern districts (Mahottari, Rautahat, Dhanusha, Sarlahi, Bara, Parsa, Saptari, Siraha and Rupandehi). These areas, where air pollution is cutting lives short by 6.8 years, are affected mainly by India’s heavily polluted northern plains.As we faced yet another air pollution crisis this year, patients with respiratory illnesses flooded the hospitals across the country. For instance, as per a recent report in the Post, in its two days of weekly OPD clinics, more than 600 people with respiratory illness reportedly visit the Teaching Hospital in Maharajgunj, Kathmandu. Despite this, the government’s recent plans and policies didn’t address the crisis. We need not scratch our heads to understand why we still do not have a national standard for annual average particulate matter. Nepal exceeds the World Health Organization’s particulate matter recommendation, i.e., PM2.5, by 15 times, taking a toll on approximately 40,000 lives annually. Countries around the world have been trying their best to curb air pollution. Take our northern neighbour, China, which decreased toxic air by 42.3 percent between 2013 and 2021. A 2023 study by the University of Chicago suggests that if the country continues at the same pace, it will increase the average life expectancy of its people by 2.2 years. If Nepal meets the WHO guidelines and reduces the PM level, it can add 3.5 years to the lives of people living in Kathmandu. Even India and Pakistan are taking this matter seriously. This should inspire our leaders to take immediate national and transboundary actions to prevent deaths related to air pollution.Our current approaches to tackling this crisis are far from adequate. Even when the air pollution level rises, our focus centres mainly on Kathmandu, and we are too myopic to see its effects on the southern plains. Be it the capital or other districts, they should get equal priority, as clean air is a fundamental right of every citizen. We need nationwide awareness campaigns to mitigate the deadly wildfires, toxic air emanating from vehicles and industries, as well as open waste-burning. While we fare better in air quality monitoring than other countries facing this crisis, there is a critical gap in mitigation measures. The policy gap in air pollution should be rectified before it is too late.  ","summary":"Air pollution has plunged the world into a global public health crisis, and Nepal is no exception.

These areas, where air pollution is cutting lives short by 6.8 years, are affected mainly by India’s heavily polluted northern plains.As we faced yet another air pollution crisis this year, patients with respiratory illnesses flooded the hospitals across the country. For instance, as per a recent report in the Post, in its two days of weekly OPD clinics, more than 600 people with respiratory illness reportedly visit the Teaching Hospital in Maharajgunj, Kathmandu. Despite this, the government’s recent plans and policies didn’t address the crisis. We need not scratch our heads to understand why we still do not have a national standard for annual average particulate matter. Nepal exceeds the World Health Organization’s particulate matter recommendation, i.e., PM2.5, by 15 times, taking a toll on approximately 40,000 lives annually. Countries around the world have been trying their best to curb air pollution. Take our northern neighbour, China, which decreased toxic air by 42.3 percent between 2013 and 2021. A 2023 study by the University of Chicago suggests that if the country continues at the same pace, it will increase the average life expectancy of its people by 2.2 years. If Nepal meets the WHO guidelines and reduces the PM level, it can add 3.5 years to the lives of people living in Kathmandu. Even India and Pakistan are taking this matter seriously. This should inspire our leaders to take immediate national and transboundary actions to prevent deaths related to air pollution.Our current approaches to tackling this crisis are far from adequate. Even when the air pollution level rises, our focus centres mainly on Kathmandu, and we are too myopic to see its effects on the southern plains. Be it the capital or other districts, they should get equal priority, as clean air is a fundamental right of every citizen. We need nationwide awareness campaigns to mitigate the deadly wildfires, toxic air emanating from vehicles and industries, as well as open waste-burning. While we fare better in air quality monitoring than other countries facing this crisis, there is a critical gap in mitigation measures. The policy gap in air pollution should be rectified before it is too late.  "},{"hash":"41afb03adc8236d8c1427dbf9dfa36ff38dab5a27d2ab2c9569f644eea6988f9","title":"vendetta-against-media","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/05/21/vendetta-against-media","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/ARREST-1716356090.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1716249600000,"source":"kp","category":"editorial","content":"Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane on Tuesday committed a gross abuse of his authority by sending Nepal Police to have Kailash Sirohiya, the chairman of Kantipur Media Group (KMG), which publishes The Kathmandu Post, arrested.

Oh, and when folks in other provinces face some problem, they have to troop all the way to Kathmandu for redress. Sugarcane farmers have repeatedly made the long march from various districts in the Tarai-Madhesh in order to demand a decent price for their produce. The same is the case with the 22-member Chure and Forest Conservation Campaign team that is currently marching from Bhardaha of Saptari district to Kathmandu. Their goal is to garner the national government’s attention on the destruction of the Chure region, a string of low hills stretching from Mechi in the east to Mahakali in the west. Natural water sources originating at the foothills of Chure have been drying up in the past few years, and the first layer of underground water has been severely depleted in much of the Tarai. The campaigners started the long march on April 28 in to exert pressure on authorities concerned about the unchecked deforestation and haphazard extraction of sand and stones in the Chure region, resulting in an acute water crisis. The campaigners have a 12-point charter of demands, including strong action against forest officers who work hand in glove with smugglers, control of illegal extraction of river-bed materials from the rivers and streams in the Chure region, declaration of Madhesh as a dry zone, and concrete plans to control forest fires. Last year, the campaign had undertaken a similar march to Kathmandu demanding control of the pollution of the Sirsiya river that flows through Birgunj, a major business hub in Madhesh Province. The Sirsiya river has become highly polluted due to the toxic industrial waste generated by several factories on the Parsa-Bara industrial corridor.

The party has done poorly in all elections since its establishment. It has also failed in service delivery despite continuously being in the government since its inception. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal caught up with the party’s General Secretary, Ghanashyam Bhusal, for insights about the Unified Socialist’s upcoming general convention and broader political dynamics. Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer?Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation. After Oli’s election as the party leader, policy issues were undermined. In fact, we were at odds because of the policy issues.What were those policy disputes?We [our faction] believed that after the establishment of democratic republic system, the fight for a political system was almost over as this is the most progressive political system of our time. We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party. The new party was confused about the way forward. The upcoming general convention will formulate clear policies in this connection. What about the leadership? Will the party get new leadership?For the past two decades, I have been advocating that a communist party should adopt the right programmes to bring about social changes. At the time, the Maoists had a policy of seizing state power through force, and the UML was talking only about transforming society through elections. But the UML was basically engaged only in winning elections. In this context, we [a group of UML leaders] came up with some policies that would make substantive changes in such ritualistic practices.Now, I have been saying that our party should be led by a leader who can internalise and effectively implement those policies. We have almost finalised the party’s policy documents. When the documents are circulated among party workers, the debate about who is eligible to implement these policies will start.You often claim to be the proponent of the CPN (Unified Socialist)’s party line. If so, will you claim party leadership to implement those policies?The first condition to become the party leader is that he/she should internalise the policies and programmes adopted by the party. I shouldn’t say that no one besides me has internalised them. It is true that I have been actively leading the debates and discussions to introduce new policies in the party. Party representatives will debate and decide this at the convention.A large number of senior leaders quit the UML to form this party. But it couldn’t even retain its members let alone further expand.There was a need for radical reforms and restructuring in communist organisations and their policies. This should have been done by the country’s largest communist party—the CPN-UML. But the party leadership and its rank and file didn’t realise the need for it. There was no serious policy discussion in the UML. While the leadership of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and its organisation are oriented in the right direction, it’s not properly trained for such restructuring. Therefore, many even accused the party leadership of being just a follower and subservient to the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre. Various sections of society who had praised us for standing against Oli’s wrong decision didn’t appreciate other political moves of our party. Parliament dissolution was a political event. A party needs clear programmes and agenda to keep public support. Unfortunately, we were found wanting in this regard. We should have done something in job creation and increasing production. We will make such things clear at the upcoming convention. Since its formation, the party has been constantly bickered over power sharing with other parties and even party leaders always seem to be wrangling for ministerial berths. Don’t you think such activities weaken the party?This happened as the party lacked clear policies to move ahead. Standing against Oli became sort of its policy as there was deep resentment against him. As far as the leaders’ attachment to power is concerned, the party was born out of power [from Parliament, not from the ground]. So the struggle for power is linked to its genesis.

We couldn’t show what we did for the betterment of the society.Party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and other top leader Jhalanath Khanal seem to be working at cross-purposes. Nepal seems closer to the Congress while Khanal has been consistently lobbying for an alliance with the UML and the Maoist Centre.We have almost resolved this issue in the course of finalising the party’s policy document. Our conclusion is that, in general, the Congress mainly represents neoliberals and comprador capitalists. When we lobby for the country’s independent economic policy, the Congress may not agree. The party tilts more towards pro-western ideas in the name of liberalism. We in our party are in consensus that in the long-run we will compete against the Congress. But we shouldn’t forget that we got the current democratic system and the constitution only after fighting jointly with the Congress.

How do you prove your relevance?The CPN-UML didn’t follow the right policies, even those endorsed by its general conventions. Party chief Oli wants total control of the party organisation, from the centre to the local units. The entire party is mobilised mainly to realise Oli’s personal ambitions. This party can’t work in favour of the society in the long run. The Maoist Centre hasn’t succeeded in transforming itself from war-era rigidity of Maoism. The Unified Socialist is here to correct these two major deviations of Nepal’s communist movement.

This convention will be a landmark event in this connection as well. Many people think that the Unified Socialist will ultimately merge with the UML.Merger is not a solution. Even if you want to bring two parties together, you have to unify them. A merger brings top leaders together based on power sharing, just like the merger of the UML and Maoist Centre in 2018. Such a merger is guided mainly by the interests of certain leaders. That’s why the merger didn’t last. The need now is unification among communist parties based on policies and programmes. Otherwise, it will be nothing more than a gathering of leaders. There is no point in merging the party to make the UML bigger and make Oli prime minister one more time.As a leader of a ruling coalition partner, how confident are you of the stability of this alliance?Given the composition of the present Parliament, we can’t rule out the making and breaking of different coalitions until the next election.

Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   ","summary":"United Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal Hanaa Singer-Hamdy has worked for close to 30 years across development and humanitarian contexts in senior management and strategic leadership roles.

You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit.

The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved?

Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council?

Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   "},{"hash":"b8cf800b128e5429effac6538b5cdeff14e12e5c92d4968c239f48ce105eb283","title":"interview-with-padam-giri","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/05/05/interview-with-padam-giri","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/padamgiri-1714923097.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1714867200000,"source":"kp","category":"interviews","content":"The budget session of the federal parliament starts Friday without the resolution of the long-standing differences between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate alleged cooperative fraud charges against Rabi Lamichhane, deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs. While several bills await parliamentary approval, whether the House will function smoothly is still uncertain. The Post’s Binod Ghimire sat down with Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, to discuss the government’s plan to make the House productive and its effort to get crucial bills endorsed in the upcoming session. He is also a CPN-UML central committee member. Excerpts:The new session is starting without resolving the old deadlock. How will you ensure its smooth functioning?The Nepali Congress should revisit its demand for the formation of a parliamentary committee targeting a particular person. This is not natural. What are the problems facing the cooperative sector as a whole, which types of fraudulent acts have taken place and who is involved in those cases, however, can be studied. We can constitute a parliamentary committee or other types of panels for such study, which can even recommend actions against those involved in fraud. Why should the main opposition shy away from a detailed study of the entire cooperative sector and want to focus on a particular case and a particular person? I am hopeful the Congress being a responsible democratic party will agree on forming a panel with a broader mandate.The prime minister on Saturday said a probe committee can be formed. What kind of committee is he talking about?He is talking about a committee to study the malpractices prevalent in the cooperative sector, to identify the problems, suggest their solutions while also recommending actions against those involved in fraudulent activities. The main intent behind demanding a probe against a particular person is that once a committee is formed, the party [the Congress] will ask for his resignation. It is an ill-intended demand aimed at creating problems. Media have reported problems in several cooperatives. Would it be feasible to form separate probe committees for each incident? We are in continuous informal discussions with the main opposition and there are plans to discuss the matter formally in an all-party meeting to be held very soon.How will the budget get endorsed if Congress continues to obstruct the House in case the probe panel is not formed as per its demand?Why just probe the home minister and the cooperative where he is allegedly involved? Why not investigate the cooperatives where the leaders from the Congress or any other party might also be involved? We are hopeful that the Congress will analyse whether its demand is rational. I cannot believe it will block budget endorsement.Have you identified why the federal parliament has become so unproductive in terms of bill endorsement?The performance of the parliament is not satisfactory. Getting the bills endorsed as quickly as possible has been my priority ever since taking charge of the ministry. Three bills have been endorsed after I became the minister just two months back. Before that, only one bill had gotten through the parliament in more than one year since the present House of Representatives came into being. That was a matter of shame. Despite the UML then being the opposition party, we had raised the issue in the parliament. It is the government’s responsibility to facilitate the deliberations over the bill and their endorsement. As a law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister, it is my major responsibility to make sure the House sessions are fruitful. I am working accordingly.There are 24 bills under consideration in the federal parliament including 23 under the lower house. I am taking initiatives to get them endorsed in the forthcoming session. The amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TJ) Act, school education bill, bill to amend some Nepal Acts, amendment bill to the Banking Office and Punishment Act, among others, are our top priorities.In January your ministry had identified 109 bills that needed to be presented and endorsed. But only two of them have been registered in the parliament. Why?Our ministry has already consented to different ministries to draft 23 bills. The ministry itself is working on eight more. Several of those bills will be registered in the upcoming session.There are complaints that the bill drafting process is not consultative, which is why many of them are controversial. What is obstructing such broad discussions?I agree that the bills drafted after broad discussions are less contentious. The respective ministries should ensure maximum engagement in the drafting process. If the current bills are drafted without proper consultation, there is room to accommodate diverse voices while they are discussed in the House committees. It won’t be possible to take discussions over all the bills to the public. However, some bills that are closely tied to public concerns need to be discussed at the provincial level or even at the local level, if possible. I also have realised the necessity of broader consultation and commit to it in the days to come.Let’s come to an amendment bill on the Transitional Justice Act. What is stopping the bill from being finalised?The Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the parliament has resolved most contentious issues after long discussions. We are close to finding meeting points on some disputed issues. We continue to engage in formal and informal discussions among the parties, with a plan to endorse it from the upcoming session. The Congress, when in government, didn’t have any differences over the bill. Rather our party had some concerns, which we are trying to sort out.I don’t think it suits the Congress to change its position after being sent to the opposition. People are closely following the position of the different parties on the bill.Listing murder as a serious violation and reduced sentencing are visibly the most contentious issues on the bill. What is the meeting point on these issues?Our party’s [the UML’s] position is clear. All killings of the disarmed people other than in the clashes are serious violations of human rights. All the parties have a common view over reduced sentencing but there are differences over its modality.We must be mindful that our transitional justice process delivers justice to the victims. The process cannot move ahead amid reservations from the victims. It is meaningless to push ahead with a process that is not acceptable to concerned stakeholders including the international community.The discussions among the parties are largely focused on these issues. From next week, the House committee will resume deliberations.A committee to recommend the names of the office bearers in two transitional justice commissions has been formed amid reservations from different quarters. Will it still recommend the names or wait until the bill is endorsed?Let us not forget that the committee was formed in line with a time-bound Supreme Court verdict. How can we ignore the court’s order? A bill doesn’t get endorsed in the government’s interest. It is a prerogative of the sovereign parliament. Demanding a halt to the formation of the recommendation committee when the court has already given its verdict is not a responsible act.I have come to know that the National Human Rights Commission hasn’t sent its representative to the committee, which is wrong. Being a responsible constitutional body it can’t baulk at implementing the court's order. It should send its representative. If there are concerns, s/he can present them before the committee.The committee has inducted two retired judges as its members which was the demands of the victims and the other stakeholders. Similarly, there has been an agreement that two members of the five-member commissions will be retired judges. We have tried to abide by the victims’ concerns as much as we can. When will the Supreme Court get justices in vacant positions?Three positions are already vacant and the fourth will be vacant in a matter of a month or so. Justices for all four positions will be selected in a week or two.Voices are growing mainly from the Congress to amend the constitution to revisit the electoral system. What is your opinion?There has been no discussion on changing the electoral modality. Yes, there is a growing concern that we should find a way to ensure greater stability. We need to discuss how.Is there any possibility of the UML and Congress coming together to form a government?This is now a closed chapter. The two parties had tried to find out possibilities for a tie-up when the present coalition was not even formed. Now there are no such discussions, formally or informally. ","summary":"The budget session of the federal parliament starts Friday without the resolution of the long-standing differences between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate alleged cooperative fraud charges against Rabi Lamichhane, deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs. While several bills await parliamentary approval, whether the House will function smoothly is still uncertain. The Post’s Binod Ghimire sat down with Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, to discuss the government’s plan to make the House productive and its effort to get crucial bills endorsed in the upcoming session. He is also a CPN-UML central committee member. Excerpts:The new session is starting without resolving the old deadlock. How will you ensure its smooth functioning?The Nepali Congress should revisit its demand for the formation of a parliamentary committee targeting a particular person. This is not natural. What are the problems facing the cooperative sector as a whole, which types of fraudulent acts have taken place and who is involved in those cases, however, can be studied. We can constitute a parliamentary committee or other types of panels for such study, which can even recommend actions against those involved in fraud. Why should the main opposition shy away from a detailed study of the entire cooperative sector and want to focus on a particular case and a particular person? I am hopeful the Congress being a responsible democratic party will agree on forming a panel with a broader mandate.The prime minister on Saturday said a probe committee can be formed. What kind of committee is he talking about?He is talking about a committee to study the malpractices prevalent in the cooperative sector, to identify the problems, suggest their solutions while also recommending actions against those involved in fraudulent activities. The main intent behind demanding a probe against a particular person is that once a committee is formed, the party [the Congress] will ask for his resignation. It is an ill-intended demand aimed at creating problems. Media have reported problems in several cooperatives. Would it be feasible to form separate probe committees for each incident? We are in continuous informal discussions with the main opposition and there are plans to discuss the matter formally in an all-party meeting to be held very soon.How will the budget get endorsed if Congress continues to obstruct the House in case the probe panel is not formed as per its demand?Why just probe the home minister and the cooperative where he is allegedly involved? Why not investigate the cooperatives where the leaders from the Congress or any other party might also be involved? We are hopeful that the Congress will analyse whether its demand is rational. I cannot believe it will block budget endorsement.Have you identified why the federal parliament has become so unproductive in terms of bill endorsement?The performance of the parliament is not satisfactory. Getting the bills endorsed as quickly as possible has been my priority ever since taking charge of the ministry. Three bills have been endorsed after I became the minister just two months back. Before that, only one bill had gotten through the parliament in more than one year since the present House of Representatives came into being. That was a matter of shame. Despite the UML then being the opposition party, we had raised the issue in the parliament. It is the government’s responsibility to facilitate the deliberations over the bill and their endorsement. As a law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister, it is my major responsibility to make sure the House sessions are fruitful. I am working accordingly.There are 24 bills under consideration in the federal parliament including 23 under the lower house. I am taking initiatives to get them endorsed in the forthcoming session.

At least 110 houses were gutted in Mahottari last week as fast-spreading fires engulfed an entire settlement. Just before that, several settlements were destroyed in Gulmi, Rupandehi and Arghakhanchi. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Anil Pokhrel, chief executive of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, for insights on why fire incidents this year have become so common and alarming.Fire incidents have been rising, causing huge losses in various parts of the country. What is the latest update?We’ve experienced an unprecedented number of fire incidents across Nepal. Around two months ago, we had made projections that something like this could happen. We hosted a national dialogue on disaster with experts from the department of hydrology and meteorology, scientists, foresters and representatives from forest users groups. The experts said this year’s outlook doesn’t look good from the perspectives of fire incidents, mainly because we didn’t get sufficient rainfall this winter. We received only one fifth or 20 percent of average. So, we had sensed the alarming situation. Along with that, we also witnessed soaring temperatures. Average temperatures have risen in hill areas as well. At the emergency meeting on Friday, we briefed top authorities about the likely scenarios due to soaring temperatures and low rainfall. This time, we also witnessed heavy winds that helped spread the fire.Are there other factors too that have made fires this year so disastrous?Inadequate rainfall, increased temperatures and wind gusts are immediate factors. There are two other factors: No fire incidents of this intensity in the past two years and only 1,528 incidents in 2022 and 3,194 in 2023. In 2021, at least 6,537 fire incidents took place, whereas there were only 1,211 incidents in 2020. When you have below average forest fire incidents in the preceding years, there is an accumulation of forest litter. While the litter piled up on the forest floor this time, there was not enough rainfall to dampen it. Rising temperatures and wind gusts added fuel, helping fires spread faster. Thus, the wildfires became more disastrous this time. Nine people have already lost their lives since Nepali New Year (April 13). The death toll of the two weeks is concerning. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane convened an emergency meeting on Friday where secretaries of the ministries concerned and security chiefs, among other senior officials, joined the discussions. We presented this scenario there and drew their attention to the fact that we still have another two months of dry season until the pre-monsoon rainfall. The next two months are going to be challenging. Besides that, there is an increasing trend of stubble burning mainly because youths aren’t available in villages to work in the fields. Due to acute shortage of labour and high cost of clearing fields, people are resorting to burning stubbles, weeds and other remains. There is a perception among the farmers that the ashes work as manure. So, we need massive awareness and training to tackle the situation. People need to be educated about the wider effects of such acts in society. We have also seen unprecedented levels of damage to houses and settlements. When large swathes of forests are burnt, a long-developed ecosystem is destroyed. There are also indirect impacts on human health. In 2019, an estimated 42,100 deaths were attributed to air pollution in Nepal. Besides, the movement of bad quality air from our southern neighbour India is also causing problems. So, this is also a regional problem. You said the ministry convened several meetings in and outside Kathmandu, held discussions among stakeholders and authorities concerned were also alerted. But why have our agencies failed to stop and contain fire incidents?Yes, we have convened a series of dialogues on fire incidents. We also organised events for specific municipalities. The most recent one was in Madhesh Province, where chief district officers of all eight districts in the province, among other officials, were invited. Home minister chaired the meeting. We are taking such initiatives to expedite preparatory measures.In fact, our forest coverage increased drastically in the past three decades. Globally, Nepal is taken as a success story in growing forests. This is positive but it also increases the risk of fires. We don’t have adequate human resources, training and equipment to protect these forests from fire. Also, the increasing trend of youths leaving the country and people migrating from the villages has exacerbated the situation. Women and the elderly who are left behind are more vulnerable to fire incidents. Homesteads of deserted houses are covered by bushes. We also find totally empty settlements. There is no gap between forests and settlements. These factors are causing disastrous fires.What is the government doing to tackle the problem in view of this changed context?We have introduced some new technologies based on our ground reality. Usually, we find people in our context go to the fire incident sites without any equipment and gear. There is also a lack of trained people across the country. So, we are focusing on training members of community forest groups. We now prioritise certain areas identified as hotspots. We are giving three types of training. We are training local volunteers who are working with palikas [local units] and other agencies at the local levels. We give orientation on how to put out fires in grasslands and bushes and how to do it when it spreads as crown fire. When trees start to burn people shouldn’t go there. Only fire brigades are useful in such cases. But fire trucks can’t go to difficult terrains. So, we have introduced portable fire pumps. We learned this from Japan’s national disaster management authority. These pumps are handheld. People can carry them on their own and use them in difficult terrains as well.Can they effectively put out big fires?They are quite effective. For that, you need a pond, a well or other source of water. Since last year, we have already used these water pumps in over 120 places and found them quite effective in dousing fires. At Friday’s meeting we decided to invest more in such pumps. I suggested every ward of local units need to have at least one such portable fire pump. They can’t replace fire trucks but are quite useful for us given our geographical features and even for narrow streets of a city like Kathmandu. You need Rs10 million to buy a fire truck, whereas around 20 portable pumps can be bought for the same amount. The cost ranges from Rs300,000 to around Rs1 million. So each ward can easily afford it. They can pump water from a distant pond or river in hill areas and it can be carried along with water tanks in narrow streets in towns. Maintaining a fire truck and fire brigade is difficult as we need drivers, firemen and their assistants. So, palikas may not be able to afford that. Therefore, we are planning to promote portable fire pumps.In addition, we are designing a training curriculum mainly targeting three sections of people—volunteers of community forest users groups, security agencies including the forest guards and the disaster responders and district level officials who should understand its nuances. We are also running campaigns through various types of awareness materials. In the meantime, we have added search and rescue equipment mainly for security agencies and other personnel deployed in the tasks. Likewise, we have started adopting advanced systems such as helicopters to put out forest fires. First time, we doused forest fires from helicopters through the ‘bambi bucket operations’ in Pathibhara of Taplejung and then in Shivapuri and Tanahu as well.Are palikas and other local agencies effective in tackling these cases?We have found local community forest groups quite active in tackling fire incidents. They may not be able to handle big fires. So they coordinate and work with security agencies. Our legal system has given palikas the lead in such cases. So, our role is to equip the local governments. We handed over 100 portable fire pumps to them while around 14 have been sent to district emergency operation centres. Our focus is on equipping local governments. Of them, some do really well. Some others have average performance while yet others do really poorly. We need to form a group of volunteers in each local unit, train them and equip them with gears. What about the role of provinces? Are they working effectively in disaster management?Provinces are critical especially for undertaking risk assessments and determining which palikas have higher, moderate and lower levels of risks. They can help enhance the capacity of local governments and in reconstruction as well. Some provincial authorities are working as per that spirit, such as in Koshi and Bagmati. Karnali has introduced a new concept of insurance for humans as well as property loss.In recent years, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of big business complexes in Kathmandu and other cities. But they don’t seem prepared to tackle fire incidents or other disasters. How do you see this trend?This is a serious issue. We discussed this matter in Friday’s emergency meeting as well. We need to devise a system to assess risk in such buildings. These buildings need to be inspected and checked for whether there is a fire fighting system in place, adequate exits and evacuation systems. We will work on these issues with local governments as it falls under their jurisdiction.

At the event, the Nepal government will present the prospects of investing in Nepal to investors and try to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Nepal acknowledges that foreign direct investment plays a major role in its economic development, given the shortage of resources within the country. The Post’s Purushottam Poudel sat down with Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Saturday to discuss the summit and what Nepal aims to gain from it.Nepal hosted two investment summits before this, in 2017 and 2019. Nepal hasn’t been able to draw the investments promised in both editions of the summit. What different is Nepal doing this time to attract more investment?We have learned from the two previous investment summits. We have also compared ourselves with our neighbouring countries in terms of attracting investments. Data suggests that while they have attracted around 30 percent of the commitments made in similar summits, Nepal has received more.We have drawn around 35 to 40 percent of the investment pledges, which should be considered good. However, we need more than this. This time, we have learned from our previous experience as to why more investment did not come.This time, we have invited investors or people who are researching possible investment prospects to the summit. We are presenting the success stories of people who have invested in other countries of the world or in Nepal. So that it can inspire people to invest.The government brought an ordinance to amend the laws that were seen as obstacles to foreign investment just a few days ago. The ordinance awaits the President’s approval. Potential investors must have noticed this. What do you say?The government has decided to amend some laws through the ordinance that we consider necessary from previous experience. The amended law has reached the President's Office for verification. By the time this interview goes to press, the ordinance may get certified. This will be strong evidence for national and international investors that Nepal is investment-friendly.On the other hand, there is the matter of sovereign credit rating—we have already started work on this. It has not started, but it will be finished soon. Once the rating works get completed it will confirm that we are more open to foreign investment. After this, we will be able to know Nepal’s investment rating without asking anyone.Based on this, foreigners can come to Nepal for investment. All these reasons show we are becoming more investor-friendly. On foreign investment, we are bringing a better policy than in the past. With policies on taxes and investment, we are creating an environment that will make it easier to bring in investments, and for investors to take the benefits back to their country without hassle.There are examples of complications faced by investors to take back dividends. Axiata, the parent company of Nepal's private telecom company Ncell, faced the problem. How will investors be attracted when they cannot take profit home?There is a legal provision for withdrawing the return on investment. We are trying to make it simple and practical by learning from the experience of other countries. No multinational company has suffered losses in Nepal. Everyone is earning profits. Ncell has raked in profit many times its investment in Nepal. Dabur Nepal and Unilever are also making profits. There are other multinational companies that are making profits by investing in Nepal.Similarly, foreign investments in the hospitality sector have also returned profits. These profits earned by the companies are no less than what they earn elsewhere. The problem seems to be that we are not presenting our data properly. We will also use this summit as a platform for investors to share their experiences of successfully investing in Nepal.Many investors appear to be attracted to hydropower. However, India has adopted a policy of not buying power from projects with Chinese investment. This also affects our investment climate. How will the government address this?We have made plans for 10 years and plans for 15 years. We have also studied how much energy we need in the coming years. Our emphasis is on clean energy such as hydropower and solar. Our policy is to sell surplus energy to neighbouring countries. Our main markets are India and Bangladesh. China is also our market, to an extent. We have signed various energy-related agreements with India, Bangladesh and China.Investments are coming into this sector from these countries. Business is also being done. Some infrastructure related to the cross-border transmission line is being built. A 400 KV high voltage transmission line has been built on the India side. Some others will be built soon. The Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur transmission line has been built. Butwal-Sunauli is in progress. Similarly, Lamki-Bareli is also in the pipeline. A long-term agreement has been signed with India to sell 10,000 megawatts of hydropower in 10 years.The agreement signed during Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to India last year is in the implementation phase. An agreement has been reached to sell 40 megawatts of hydropower to Bangladesh through India. Bangladesh has asked us for more electricity. We are coordinating with Bangladesh and India at various levels on this issue.As far as the Indian policy is concerned, we will try to consume our own electricity first. We will try to sell the surplus energy to regional markets.Nepal’s political instability is said to be distracting foreign investors. How do you convince them?There is no truth in this. Change of political leadership does not hinder foreign investment in Nepal. This is a normal practice in a democratic system with regular elections. Sometimes the government veers into the minority. Our mixed electoral system tends to give no single party the majority. As a result, we have a coalition government. And whether or not the government maintains policy consistency is important. We may not always have a stable government, but we have a stable policy.We have adopted consistent policies in the fields of hydropower and cement industries for 10 to 15 years. The minister may be changed due to the change of government, but there is no change in policy. Any change in policy is meant for the convenience of investors.When the government was led by the Congress-Maoist alliance, it was said that big investors—from India's richest man, Gautam Adani to the Tata Group—were interested in investing in Nepal. However, with the communist forces in power, they are said to be reluctant.This is just a rumour spread by those who do not want the prosperity of Nepal. It is true that some people close to Indian businessman Gautam Adani came to Nepal, and they showed interest in investing in Nepal. According to my information, Adani has invested in Nepal's cement industry. And even now he is positive about investing in Nepal. His representatives are coming to the investment summit as well. The summit is not a matter related to the views of any party. This is Nepal's investment conference. Just because there is a particular coalition does not mean investment will not come. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was the leader of the government when the summit was announced and he is still leading the government. Such rumours are propaganda peddled by those who want to keep investments away.Again, as far as Gautam Adani is concerned, I am personally in touch with people who work with him at various levels. When I became a minister, I invited Adani to Nepal, and we have interacted with him frequently. He is still looking at different areas of investment. He is especially interested in airport construction and management and the energy sector.Geopolitical factors are also believed to impact investments. Is the government prepared to ensure that geopolitics does not affect investment prospects?There are geopolitical conflicts all over the world. In Nepal, we are not against anyone's legal investment. We have always welcomed foreign investment that comes with good intent. If geopolitics affects investment, the most intense geopolitical competition is between the US and China. But these two countries are also the world's largest trading partners. When talking about India and China, there may be competition between them, but there is also cooperation. We need legitimate investment in priority areas. We want to ensure that the investments coming into our country are not targeted against any country.Let’s invest in Nepal. ","summary":"The third edition of the Nepal Investment Summit starts today. At the event, the Nepal government will present the prospects of investing in Nepal to investors and try to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Nepal acknowledges that foreign direct investment plays a major role in its economic development, given the shortage of resources within the country. The Post’s Purushottam Poudel sat down with Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Saturday to discuss the summit and what Nepal aims to gain from it.Nepal hosted two investment summits before this, in 2017 and 2019. Nepal hasn’t been able to draw the investments promised in both editions of the summit. What different is Nepal doing this time to attract more investment?We have learned from the two previous investment summits. We have also compared ourselves with our neighbouring countries in terms of attracting investments. Data suggests that while they have attracted around 30 percent of the commitments made in similar summits, Nepal has received more.We have drawn around 35 to 40 percent of the investment pledges, which should be considered good. However, we need more than this. This time, we have learned from our previous experience as to why more investment did not come.This time, we have invited investors or people who are researching possible investment prospects to the summit. We are presenting the success stories of people who have invested in other countries of the world or in Nepal. So that it can inspire people to invest.The government brought an ordinance to amend the laws that were seen as obstacles to foreign investment just a few days ago. The ordinance awaits the President’s approval. Potential investors must have noticed this. What do you say?The government has decided to amend some laws through the ordinance that we consider necessary from previous experience. The amended law has reached the President's Office for verification. By the time this interview goes to press, the ordinance may get certified. This will be strong evidence for national and international investors that Nepal is investment-friendly.On the other hand, there is the matter of sovereign credit rating—we have already started work on this. It has not started, but it will be finished soon. Once the rating works get completed it will confirm that we are more open to foreign investment. After this, we will be able to know Nepal’s investment rating without asking anyone.Based on this, foreigners can come to Nepal for investment. All these reasons show we are becoming more investor-friendly. On foreign investment, we are bringing a better policy than in the past. With policies on taxes and investment, we are creating an environment that will make it easier to bring in investments, and for investors to take the benefits back to their country without hassle.There are examples of complications faced by investors to take back dividends. Axiata, the parent company of Nepal's private telecom company Ncell, faced the problem. How will investors be attracted when they cannot take profit home?There is a legal provision for withdrawing the return on investment. We are trying to make it simple and practical by learning from the experience of other countries. No multinational company has suffered losses in Nepal. Everyone is earning profits. Ncell has raked in profit many times its investment in Nepal. Dabur Nepal and Unilever are also making profits. There are other multinational companies that are making profits by investing in Nepal.Similarly, foreign investments in the hospitality sector have also returned profits. These profits earned by the companies are no less than what they earn elsewhere. The problem seems to be that we are not presenting our data properly.

It is misleading, though, to assert that the landmark legal code gives ''nearly single-minded focus on propping up the caste system.\" Muluki Ain rationalised the judicial structure and codified legal principles of a common law throughout the nation that substantiated the status of a sovereign state. By defining the powers inherent in, and assigning definitive responsibilities to, institutions of governance, including that of the monarch and the prime minister, it ensured that specific provisions of law replaced or minimised arbitrary verdicts that were the norm earlier and thereby recognised the concept of the rule of law, a vital component of democratic norms and constitutions. The four-tier caste varna division was linked with the individual's aptitude and profession during the formative, Vedic age of the Sanatana Dharma. It was later given a “sinister twist and linked with the accident of birth”, as stated by Swami Chinmayananda in his commentary on the Gita in The Holy Gita. In the late 14th century, King Jayasthiti Malla of Kathmandu compiled and adopted the thus far informal or unwritten legal and spiritual tenets based on the extant practices (including the caste system) and gave it the name of Nepala Rashtra Shastra. The comprehensive and mammoth Muluki Ain was compiled by a 230-member council constituted by Jung Bahadur after nearly three years of arduous travels and extensive discussion throughout the country. It covered every aspect of life in the country, including ‘farting in someone's face’ as curiously singled out in Thapa’s column, the religious shastras, practices, customs and social traditions of different regions and communities that necessarily included the injustices embedded in the caste system. The document is undoubtedly based on the moral principles of the shastras and extant traditions including the caste system, but it also recognises the need for timely reforms and thus stipulates that conflicting verdicts appear (in the past) for similar cases or offences: ‘henceforth, on breach of law the punishment to all people shall be uniform’ depending on the caste of the offender.Finally, one must remember that Muluki Ain, as its title clarifies, is a legal code and not a paper on socio-cultural-religious reforms. Nevertheless, it expresses its intent of purpose for such reforms sporadically.Sagar SJB Rana, Lalitpur ","summary":"The 1854 Muluki Ain, translated by Heidelberg University, codifies legal principles, replaces arbitrary verdicts with the rule of law, acknowledges the caste system while recognizing the need for reforms."},{"hash":"f26d8550751249ca6fce9099e307f744741857845591c48ab0d55210ac42e144","title":"Misleading news is information that is presented as true but is actually false or inaccurate.
