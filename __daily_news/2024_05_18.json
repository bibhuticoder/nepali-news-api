The water intake area subsided nearly by nearly one foot after the quake. There has been an acute shortage of drinking water in the Kapke area over the past seven months, leaving 120 households in hardships. The locals are forced to manage water from the Sidherikhola stream, which is around half an hour walk from the settlement.âWe have to be frugal in using water due to the water crisis in the area. The villagers are forced to wake up early to manage drinking water. The women and children spend the whole morning fetching water from the spring,â said Gajendra BK of Kapke.Plight of the locals in Ghartigaun in ward 6 of Barekot and Bayala in ward 1 is also the same. Various settlements in the area are reeling under water crisis as the November 3 quake damaged drinking water projects. Around 200 families in Ghartigaun and Bayala are hugely affected. The villagers have no alternative than to go to the nearest streams or other water sources for drinking water.âOne gagri (water pot) of water that I fetch in the morning is hardly enough to prepare a morning meal and for drinking purposes. One has to be busy from dawn to dusk fetching water from the nearby spring after the earthquake damaged the drinking water project,â lamented Bimala Gharti of Barekot-6. âIt is quite difficult to carry water uphill. And there is always the threat of wildlife attack as we have to go to the water spring in the wee hours,â she shared her ordeal.Many water sources have dried up in the aftermath of the earthquake that hit Jajarkot, Rukum West and Salyan districts in the Karnali Province. According to the data available at the District Administration Office in Jajarkot, the sources of 143 drinking water projects dried up in the district after the November earthquake. Water supply has been disrupted in 106 drinking water projects as the quake caused substantial damage to reserve tanks and pipelines.Nalgad Municipality is the hardest hit by the water crisis. There is an acute water shortage as 23 drinking water projects were destroyed while 26 others suffered partial damage in the natural disaster.âAround 3,000 families of various settlements in Nalgad are reeling under an acute shortage of water. The villagers are forced to drink unsafe water from the Bheri river and other sources, exposing them to various water-borne diseases,â said Dambar Bahadur Rawat, deputy mayor of Nalgad. According to him, the number of patients suffering from diarrhoea and dysentery is rising in recent times, apparently due to drinking unsafe water. According to Nalgad Municipal Hospital, around 150 patients visit the health institution on a daily basis now. âMost of the patients suffer from fever, diarrhoea, typhoid and common cold. Open defecation by the quake-displaced people living in temporary shelters causes serious health problems. There could be an outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases if the problem is not addressed immediately,â said Dr Bishal Uprety, chief at the hospital.Around 8,000 temporary shelters, according to Rawat, were built in Nalgad Municipality. âSome people have been using old toilets while others defecate in the open,â said Rawat.Bheri Municipality, located at the headquarters, is also facing a drinking water problem.âThere was always a shortage of drinking water in ward 4 of Bheri Municipality, but it was all manageable with the water from natural springs. Currently, everybody is forced to buy water for all purposes because all natural springs dried up after the earthquake,â said Basant Prasad Sharma, chairman of the ward.Residents of Kudu in ward 13 of the municipality have been grappling with water shortages for years. A tap has been installed for nearly 300 families in Kudu after drilling a deep borewell.âI wake up at 3:00 am in the morning and reach the tap to get in line because water is available only for a short time. When the tap runs dry, people are compelled to walk to the Bheri River three kilometres away, to fetch murky water,â said Sarita Rokaya, a local of Kudu who is living in a temporary shelter after her house was completely destroyed in the earthquake.After the earthquake, nearly 80 percent of the locals of Kudu have migrated to temporary shelters made up of zinc sheets. Due to the shortage of drinking water, locals are forced to drink dirty and unsafe water.âIn the zinc sheet shelter it gets extremely hot during the day, we need more water to stay hydrated and for cleaning purposes. But there is not enough water,â Rokaya added.Due to the lack of irrigation and drinking water, the locals of Kudu cultivate only summer crops. In order to solve the drinking water problem in Kudu, as part of the Integrated Karnali Irrigation Development Project, the government installed a deep borewell that could work using solar energy last year by spending Rs56.3 million.Harka Bahadur Rokaya, another local of Kudu, said that after the earthquake, even the borewell is not pumping water like before.In Jajarkot, despite being close to streams, rivers, and springs, everybody suffers from a drinking water shortage during the summer season.Badri Pant, the chairman of ward 4 of Nalgad Municipality, said that after the earthquake, the water shortage has worsened in all the surrounding areas of the ward.âAll the springs slowly dried up after the earthquake, and the water level in the Bheri River is also very low. There is no alternative option except to use the murky water of the river,â said Pant. âAnimal husbandry has also been greatly affected due to the water shortage,â Pant added.Bir Bahadur Giri, chairman of Barekot Rural Municipality, said that plans are being made and prioritised to solve the problem of water shortage in the rural municipality.âAlong with other public structures, the earthquake has destroyed water supply projects in all wards, and we have accelerated the repair work on ten damaged projects, which is expected to be completed before the end of the current fiscal year,â said Giri.âWe have requested the provincial government to help us build a big drinking water project to solve the water scarcity problem in the municipality, but so far we have not received any reply,â said Chandraprakash Gharti, mayor of Bheri Municipality.According to the Ministry of Water Resources and Energy Development of Karnali Province, the earthquake damaged 480 water supply projects in Jajarkot, Salyan, and Rukum West, and the loss caused to the projects has been estimated at Rs3 billion.âThe damaged projects will be reconstructed and repaired with the cooperation of the government of all three levels,â said Nabin Chandra Adhikari, secretary of the Ministry of Water Resources and Energy Development of Karnali Province.

There could be an outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases if the problem is not addressed immediately,â said Dr Bishal Uprety, chief at the hospital.Around 8,000 temporary shelters, according to Rawat, were built in Nalgad Municipality. âSome people have been using old toilets while others defecate in the open,â said Rawat.Bheri Municipality, located at the headquarters, is also facing a drinking water problem.âThere was always a shortage of drinking water in ward 4 of Bheri Municipality, but it was all manageable with the water from natural springs. Currently, everybody is forced to buy water for all purposes because all natural springs dried up after the earthquake,â said Basant Prasad Sharma, chairman of the ward.Residents of Kudu in ward 13 of the municipality have been grappling with water shortages for years. A tap has been installed for nearly 300 families in Kudu after drilling a deep borewell.âI wake up at 3:00 am in the morning and reach the tap to get in line because water is available only for a short time. When the tap runs dry, people are compelled to walk to the Bheri River three kilometres away, to fetch murky water,â said Sarita Rokaya, a local of Kudu who is living in a temporary shelter after her house was completely destroyed in the earthquake.After the earthquake, nearly 80 percent of the locals of Kudu have migrated to temporary shelters made up of zinc sheets. Due to the shortage of drinking water, locals are forced to drink dirty and unsafe water.âIn the zinc sheet shelter it gets extremely hot during the day, we need more water to stay hydrated and for cleaning purposes. But there is not enough water,â Rokaya added.Due to the lack of irrigation and drinking water, the locals of Kudu cultivate only summer crops. In order to solve the drinking water problem in Kudu, as part of the Integrated Karnali Irrigation Development Project, the government installed a deep borewell that could work using solar energy last year by spending Rs56.3 million.Harka Bahadur Rokaya, another local of Kudu, said that after the earthquake, even the borewell is not pumping water like before.In Jajarkot, despite being close to streams, rivers, and springs, everybody suffers from a drinking water shortage during the summer season.Badri Pant, the chairman of ward 4 of Nalgad Municipality, said that after the earthquake, the water shortage has worsened in all the surrounding areas of the ward.âAll the springs slowly dried up after the earthquake, and the water level in the Bheri River is also very low. There is no alternative option except to use the murky water of the river,â said Pant. âAnimal husbandry has also been greatly affected due to the water shortage,â Pant added.Bir Bahadur Giri, chairman of Barekot Rural Municipality, said that plans are being made and prioritised to solve the problem of water shortage in the rural municipality.âAlong with other public structures, the earthquake has destroyed water supply projects in all wards, and we have accelerated the repair work on ten damaged projects, which is expected to be completed before the end of the current fiscal year,â said Giri.âWe have requested the provincial government to help us build a big drinking water project to solve the water scarcity problem in the municipality, but so far we have not received any reply,â said Chandraprakash Gharti, mayor of Bheri Municipality.According to the Ministry of Water Resources and Energy Development of Karnali Province, the earthquake damaged 480 water supply projects in Jajarkot, Salyan, and Rukum West, and the loss caused to the projects has been estimated at Rs3 billion.âThe damaged projects will be reconstructed and repaired with the cooperation of the government of all three levels,â said Nabin Chandra Adhikari, secretary of the Ministry of Water Resources and Energy Development of Karnali Province.

This lays the groundwork for a thriving society where each individual plays a vital role. For such a vision to come to fruition, it is essential to effectively utilise human resources. However, the question persists: How can a nation tap into the potential of its young workforce, ambitious achievers, learners, experienced retirees, migrant returnees and vulnerable populations primed for empowerment through education?Consider the management of police and military personnel on the verge of retirement, mainly those retiring in five years. In the past fiscal year, 5,961 police personnel chose voluntary retirement. One wonders what happens to their preparedness for combat and mindset regarding deployment after retirement and when retirement time approaches. The security mindset ingrained in police forces and militaries demands perpetual vigilance, rigorous training and an unwavering commitment to upholding public safety through proactive assessment and decisive action when required. There is a need to balance the seasoned and disciplined attributes they hone over the years.Comprehending the present challenges faced by students in Nepal is another aspect worth considering, as it can offer valuable perspectives on the employment scenario. Recent findings from the first-ever textbook audit report conducted by Education in Every Home, an organisation working on the education sector in Nepal, paint a stark picture: Only 75 percent children complete 8th grade, with a mere 27 percent advancing to 12th grade. How can the diverse youth receive the support they need from the government and society to enhance their thought processes and effectively utilise their potential when they donât complete their education? Enhancing human resource management for those on the brink of retirement and promoting youth employment demands more than abstract notions. Practical steps are required to unite people of all ages. Prioritising accessible education, skill development and mentorship programmes is paramount. Moreover, itâs imperative to foster connections among eager learners, individuals seeking guidance and those who derive fulfilment from careers like police and military service. By valuing these professions and harnessing the spirit of youth, we can create a more dynamic and impactful community. Yet, beyond these efforts, we must explore innovative strategies to effectively manage human resources and combat unemployment. Tackling unemploymentThe unemployment problem can be tackled in two ways. First, the government can emulate the historical approach of Franklin D Roosevelt, who galvanised the âlost generationâ to pioneer civilian conservation corps initiatives in forestry, flood control and infrastructure enhancements in the United States. As Homraj Acharya, a seasoned policy expert with extensive experience in US government and development projects in South Asia, contends, the Roosevelt approach left an indelible mark on the physical, psychological and employability facets of three million individuals enrolled in the programme. Their involvement in economic relief and conservation efforts offers a blueprint for modern initiatives tackling poverty and environmental concerns. Enrollees resided in camps, engaged in various projects and underwent rigorous training and education within the corps. This precedent offers a compelling model for addressing unemployment, poverty and environmental conservation.Drawing inspiration from Rooseveltâs visionary approach, Nepal could mobilise individuals nearing retirement age to establish a development brigade. This could enlist 50,000 individuals with approximately five years left until retirement, comprising 5,000 from the police force, 5,000 from the military and 40,000 from civilian sectors. The government can allocate additional funds to boost the salaries of police and military officers nearing retirement for joining the development brigade. These individuals can undertake infrastructure development, community enhancement, park innovation, river and lake clean up and conservation, road construction, solar panel installations, reforestation, herbs production and processing and unused productive land utilisation. This strategic initiative addresses unemployment and capitalises on valuable skills and expertise for national advancement. By offering meaningful employment opportunities in these sectors, Nepal can harness their skills and experience, reducing unemployment rates. This targeted approach would ensure continued workforce contribution and alleviate the financial burden on social welfare programmes, ultimately promoting more excellent economic stability and societal resilience.Second, to actively engage youth and students in meaningful work, introducing service learningâan educational approachâcan inspire them to participate in community-based projects, nurturing awareness, empathy, critical thinking skills, leadership abilities, teamwork, cultural competence, communication skill and a sense of social responsibility. The mandatory service-learning project for high school students can be easily connected to the development brigade initiative, suggests Acharya. The programme, also known as community learning or experiential learning, can foster collaboration between universities, businesses, nonprofits and government entities, benefiting the local community. Through service-learning courses, students earn credits while undertaking hands-on experiences such as office work, fieldwork, journaling and reflection papers. They can expand professional networks, cultivate friendships, enhance well-being, build confidence, confirm career interests, and explore new fields of study. Introducing the concept of service learning, which can later evolve into the digital literacy brigade, can facilitate a smooth transition from acquiring practical skills to addressing unemployment for the youth and students of Nepal. As students engage in hands-on experiences during service-learning courses, they cultivate crucial skills for navigating the generational realm, enhancing employability and contributing to workforce readiness. This will ultimately benefit the country through a more skilled and capable workforce fostering economic improvement. Such initiatives provide practical solutions and promote a unified responsibility for societal progress. Prioritising accessible education, skill development and meaningful employment opportunities shall ensure that everyone, regardless of age or background, can meaningfully contribute to the nationâs advancement. By grasping the importance of intelligent human resource management and investing in the growth of citizens, Nepal can build a rock-solid base for a vibrant and challenging society. Here, every single member steps up to mould the shared future.Nepal is a development professional and co-founder of Education in Every Home.

Their involvement in economic relief and conservation efforts offers a blueprint for modern initiatives tackling poverty and environmental concerns. Enrollees resided in camps, engaged in various projects and underwent rigorous training and education within the corps. This precedent offers a compelling model for addressing unemployment, poverty and environmental conservation.Drawing inspiration from Rooseveltâs visionary approach, Nepal could mobilise individuals nearing retirement age to establish a development brigade. This could enlist 50,000 individuals with approximately five years left until retirement, comprising 5,000 from the police force, 5,000 from the military and 40,000 from civilian sectors. The government can allocate additional funds to boost the salaries of police and military officers nearing retirement for joining the development brigade. These individuals can undertake infrastructure development, community enhancement, park innovation, river and lake clean up and conservation, road construction, solar panel installations, reforestation, herbs production and processing and unused productive land utilisation. This strategic initiative addresses unemployment and capitalises on valuable skills and expertise for national advancement. By offering meaningful employment opportunities in these sectors, Nepal can harness their skills and experience, reducing unemployment rates. This targeted approach would ensure continued workforce contribution and alleviate the financial burden on social welfare programmes, ultimately promoting more excellent economic stability and societal resilience.Second, to actively engage youth and students in meaningful work, introducing service learningâan educational approachâcan inspire them to participate in community-based projects, nurturing awareness, empathy, critical thinking skills, leadership abilities, teamwork, cultural competence, communication skill and a sense of social responsibility. The mandatory service-learning project for high school students can be easily connected to the development brigade initiative, suggests Acharya. The programme, also known as community learning or experiential learning, can foster collaboration between universities, businesses, nonprofits and government entities, benefiting the local community. Through service-learning courses, students earn credits while undertaking hands-on experiences such as office work, fieldwork, journaling and reflection papers. They can expand professional networks, cultivate friendships, enhance well-being, build confidence, confirm career interests, and explore new fields of study. Introducing the concept of service learning, which can later evolve into the digital literacy brigade, can facilitate a smooth transition from acquiring practical skills to addressing unemployment for the youth and students of Nepal. As students engage in hands-on experiences during service-learning courses, they cultivate crucial skills for navigating the generational realm, enhancing employability and contributing to workforce readiness. This will ultimately benefit the country through a more skilled and capable workforce fostering economic improvement. Such initiatives provide practical solutions and promote a unified responsibility for societal progress. Prioritising accessible education, skill development and meaningful employment opportunities shall ensure that everyone, regardless of age or background, can meaningfully contribute to the nationâs advancement. By grasping the importance of intelligent human resource management and investing in the growth of citizens, Nepal can build a rock-solid base for a vibrant and challenging society. Here, every single member steps up to mould the shared future.Nepal is a development professional and co-founder of Education in Every Home.

Though it has supplied desperately needed weapons and ammunition, it has done little else to address Ukraineâs needs.What would an effective strategy look like? For starters, Western governments need to establish shared goals. Ukraine must expel Russian forces and recover all the territory that it has lost since 2014; Russia must be forced to pay war reparations to compensate Ukraine (the World Bank estimates that reconstruction will cost about $500 billion over the next decade); the thousands of Ukrainians who have been deported to Russia must be allowed to return; and the tens of thousands of suspected war crimes committed by Russian troops must be prosecuted and punished.The West can no longer get away with promising to support Ukraine âfor as long as it takes.â Rather than holding Ukraine back from attacking Russian strategic and military assets, it should welcome such strikes. Losing the war is the best thing that could happen to Russia. Historically, military defeats have usually led to reforms and a change in leadership â as happened after the Crimean War (1853-56), the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), and the war in Afghanistan (1979-88). Vladimir Putin has re-introduced Stalinist-level repression and opted for eternal war, a project that is likely to end in his demise. While it is ultimately up to Russians to effect regime change, the West should welcome the prospect.Many believe that Russia has the advantage in a long war, simply because its population and economy are larger than Ukraineâs (though the United States was defeated in Vietnam and Afghanistan after long wars). Whatever the case, a longer war undoubtedly will cost everyone much more. As such, the West should return to former US Secretary of State Colin Powellâs Gulf War tactic of âshock and aweâ to bring about a Ukrainian victory.That means delivering all the best conventional arms to Ukraine as soon as possible, rather than continuing the current drip-feed of old weapons. Nobody can put such weapons to better use than Ukraineâs skilful soldiers. If Ukraine were to lose, Russian forces would march further into Europe to fulfil Putinâs neo-Czarist ambition of restoring the Russian Empire. Since Ukraineâs people are fighting and dying to defend Europe, the least the West can do is give them all they need to win. Denmark and the Baltic states have set an example others should follow.Specifically, the West should furnish Ukraine with potent long-range weaponsâsuch as ATACMS and Taurus missilesâas well as a strong air force, so that it can gain supremacy over the skies. With thousands of Westerners having volunteered to fight for Ukraine on the front lines, why shouldnât Western pilots join, too? Ukraine needs proper air defense. Absurdly, the West has made Russia, rather than Ukraine, a no-fly zone.The eminent retired US Generals Ben Hodges and Philip Breedlove have long argued that Crimea is likely to be decisive. Similarly, in the mid-nineteenth century, Pavel Nakhimov, an admiral in the Imperial Russian Navy, observed that whoever controls Sevastopol (Crimeaâs largest port) controls the Black Sea. Clearly, Ukrainian control of that city should be a major strategic goal. To cut Russia off from Crimea, Ukraine also will need to destroy the Kerch Strait bridges to the peninsula.To force Russia to pay war reparations to Ukraine, the West should confiscate the $300 billion of Russian central-bank reserves that it has frozen. Canada and the US have already adopted laws authorising such a move; they should follow through, and the European Union should follow suit. It is unconscionable that Russia can violate international laws with abandon and still have its property shielded in the West. As long as the war continues, the West will need to provide Ukraine with $100 billion per yearâ$50 billion at least in military assistance, $40 billion to finance the civilian government, and $10 billion in humanitarian assistance.While Western sanctions on Russia have had some bite, they must be strengthened. Owing to the existing sanctions, the Russian economy has not grown since 2014, and its export revenues fell by 26 percent last year. But to tighten sanctions further, all Western governments should impose prohibitive tariffs on all imports from Russiaâas the EU is currently doing with respect to Russian agricultural goods. Western countries have already rescinded Russiaâs most-favoured-nation status, and bounded tariffs permitted by the World Trade Organization are very high. Since Western countries trade so little with Russia, higher tariffs will no longer have any meaningful impact on their domestic inflation. And since the customs system functions well, enforcement problems would be minimised.During the Cold War, Western governments cooperated through the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom), headquartered in Paris. That body should be restored to ensure more effective control over sensitive exports to Russia. Personal sanctions also need to be coordinated, reinforced, and streamlined. All sanctioning jurisdictions should agree on similar rules, impose the same sanctions, and exchange classified information about the reasons for them.Meanwhile, Russians who condemn the war and withdraw from Russia should be delisted in all jurisdictions. Secret ownership in the West by sanctioned oligarchs should no longer be tolerated. Similarly, the West needs to start thinking about how to penalise Western companies that continue to work in Russia and support the Russian government with taxes and other benefits. One reasonable idea is that they be forced to pay penal taxes commensurate to what they pay to Russia.Finally, the EU should start accession negotiations with Ukraine, and NATO should use its 75th anniversary summit in Washington in July to extend a formal membership invitation to Ukraine. A large majority of NATO members already supported doing so at last yearâs summit in Vilnius.

The very next day, the government wrote to the secretariat for the withdrawal. âWe decided to withdraw the bill because we have realised that some changes are necessary on it,â Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, told the Post. âThe decision was reached after an agreement among the ruling parties.âSince the bill was presented in the lower house by then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Narayan Kaji Shrestha on February 2, it is now the property of Parliament. âIt can be withdrawn only if the lower house endorses the withdrawal proposal,â Ek Ram Giri, spokesman of the Parliament Secretariat, told the Post. Both the Houses of the federal parliament have become non-functional due to protests by the main opposition. It has been demanding the formation of a parliamentary panel to investigate the embezzlement of funds of four cooperatives that invested in the now defunct Gorkha Media Network, where Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane was the executive director. While the opposition has been insisting on a committee to specifically investigate Lamichhane, the ruling parties are calling for a broader inquiry into the issues affecting the entire cooperatives sector. Withdrawal of the bill, therefore, is not possible as long as the obstruction continues. The bill in Parliament aims to reinstate some of the provisions in the Act that became void after the ordinance to revise the Act was repealed three years ago. On August 18, 2021, the then Sher Bahadur Deuba government had issued an ordinance to amend the Act to ease the split of two partiesâthe CPN-UML and the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal. The ordinance revised a provision in the Act that previously required the support of 40 percent of members in both the parliamentary party and the central committee to split a party. The ordinance lowered the bar to 20 percent in any one of the committees.On August 26 that year, Madhav Kumar Nepal of the UML and Mahantha Thakur of the Janata Samajbadi registered new partiesâthe CPN (Unified Socialist) and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, respectively.Two days later, the ordinance was repealed, having served its purpose. The provisions amended by the ordinance have become void after it was repealed. Three months ago, in February, a bill to reactivate those provisions of the Act was registered in Parliament which the government wants to withdraw now. The existing bill proposes restoring the earlier provision to have a minimum of having at least 40 percent support in both the parliamentary party and the central committee to split the party. Now, the government wants to lower the bar by introducing a new bill. âInstead of a minimum requirement of 40 percent in the parliamentary party and the central committee, a new bill could allow a split with 40 percent support in either of the committees,â said a leader from ruling CPN-UML.The Ashok Rai faction of the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal on May 5 split the party and launched a new Janata Samajbadi Party. As there are no legal provisions in the Political Parties Act relating to the formation of a new party after a split in an existing one, the commission registered the new party as per the regulations on political parties.Upendra Yadav, chairperson of the JSPN, has challenged the commissionâs decision in the Supreme Court.Political experts say the act of tweaking the Act to suit the interest of some parties is a very irresponsible act. They say the parties that should be discussing the issue of national interest as the country is facing an intense economic crisis are happy playing petty party politics. \"This is an example that our parties can stoop to any low for their interest.

As there are no legal provisions in the Political Parties Act relating to the formation of a new party after a split in an existing one, the commission registered the new party as per the regulations on political parties.Upendra Yadav, chairperson of the JSPN, has challenged the commissionâs decision in the Supreme Court.Political experts say the act of tweaking the Act to suit the interest of some parties is a very irresponsible act. They say the parties that should be discussing the issue of national interest as the country is facing an intense economic crisis are happy playing petty party politics. \"This is an example that our parties can stoop to any low for their interest. Their one and only focus is to stay in power by any means,\" Sanjeev Humagain, who teaches political science in Tribhuvan University, told the Post.

Moti Mahal said founder Kundan Lal Gujral created the cream-loaded dish in the 1930s at an eatery in Peshawar, now in Pakistan, before relocating to Delhi.That âstory of invention of butter chicken does not ring trueâ and is aimed at misleading the court, Daryaganj said in a new, 642-page counter-filing reviewed by Reuters.Daryaganj says a late member of its founding family, Kundan Lal Jaggi, created the disputed dish when he helmed the kitchen at the relocated Delhi eatery, where Gujral, his friend-cum-partner from Peshawar only handled marketing.Both men are dead, Gujral in 1997 and Jaggi in 2018.Evidence in the non-public filing includes a black-and-white photograph from 1930s showing the two friends in Peshawar; a 1949 partnership agreement; Jaggiâs business card after relocating to Delhi and his 2017 video talking about the dishâs origin.By virtue of the friendsâ partnership, âboth parties can claim that their respective ancestors created the dishes,â Daryaganj says in the filing, calling the dispute a âbusiness rivalryâ.Moti Mahal declined to comment. The judge will next hear the case on May 29.A key point of contention, which the court will have to rule on, is where, when and by whom the dish was first made - by Gujral in Peshawar, Jaggi in New Delhi, or if both should be credited.Butter chicken is ranked 43rd in a list of worldâs âbest dishesâ by TasteAtlas, and bragging rights about who invented it can matter, brand experts said.âBeing an inventor has a huge advantage globally and in terms of consumer appeal. You are also entitled to charge more,â said Dilip Cherian, an image guru and co-founder of Indian PR firm Perfect Relations.Moti Mahal operates a franchisee model with over 100 outlets globally. Its butter chicken dishes start at $8 in New Delhi, and are priced at $23 in New York.Late U.S. President Richard Nixon and Indiaâs first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru are among the famous clients to have visited its primary outlet in Delhi.Daryaganj started in 2019 and its butter chicken costs $7.50. It has 10 outlets, mostly in New Delhi, with plans to expand to other Indian cities and Bangkok.In its 2,752-page Indian lawsuit, Moti Mahal had also accused Daryaganj of copying âthe look and feelâ of the interiors of its outlets.Daryaganj has retorted with photographs of restaurant interiors which the judge will review, claiming it is Moti Mahal that has copied its âdesign of floor tilesâ.

Its butter chicken dishes start at $8 in New Delhi, and are priced at $23 in New York.Late U.S. President Richard Nixon and Indiaâs first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru are among the famous clients to have visited its primary outlet in Delhi.Daryaganj started in 2019 and its butter chicken costs $7.50. It has 10 outlets, mostly in New Delhi, with plans to expand to other Indian cities and Bangkok.In its 2,752-page Indian lawsuit, Moti Mahal had also accused Daryaganj of copying âthe look and feelâ of the interiors of its outlets.Daryaganj has retorted with photographs of restaurant interiors which the judge will review, claiming it is Moti Mahal that has copied its âdesign of floor tilesâ.

Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled âImplementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the Peopleâs Republic of China and the Government of Nepalâ is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime ministerâs office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the planâs signing.âIt is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,â Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinpingâs Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, Chinaâs State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.âThe countryâs economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,â said an official at the Prime Ministerâs Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the âSilkroad Roadsterâ in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.âWhen the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime ministerâs trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an âappropriateâ time,â former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. âWe also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.âThe Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The documentâs sub-section 12 titled âOther Areasâ under section 3 named âCooperation Prioritiesâ mentions that âthe two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperationâ.It also says âthe two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster managementâ.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority. In every high-level visit and meeting between Nepal and China, the initiative gets traction.Although there is no clear provision on whether the two sides should renew the agreement by exchanging correspondence, officials at the finance ministry said that would be the diplomatically correct way to go about it.There are concerns over the BRIâs stalled momentum in Nepal. The initiativeâs stated focus is connectivity, trade, development strategies, and policy dialogues for cooperation in the fields of economy, environment, technology and culture.The agreement also aims to facilitate transit transport, logistics, transport network security and related infrastructure development through joint study and promote cross-border projects including railway, road, civil aviation, power grid, information and communication. The MoU also states that the two sides would conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement shortly and, if viable, start negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement to open up more markets and expand bilateral trade.Other stated areas of agreed cooperation are establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones at the existing ports, and improving the investment landscape with a view to developing mega projects in the areas of power generation, water conservation, road, railway line, cross-border transmission line, information and communication technology and infrastructure, besides customs and quarantine.Nepal also had a shaky position on the BRI in the past. After signing the deal in 2017, the government formed two committees headed by the foreign and finance secretaries to negotiate with China on the projects selected under the initiative. The finance secretary was tasked with project selection.As per the Cabinetâs mandate, the finance secretary-led committee picked 35 projects to be funded under the BRI. Then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli read out this list during his meeting with Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. Later, the Chinese side urged Kathmandu to cut the number of projects to a single digit, whereupon the list was pared down to nine projects.A former finance ministry official who was involved in several negotiations with the Chinese side said most of the nine projects were related to connectivity and infrastructure. In 2019, during the second BRI Conference in China, its outcome document listed Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network under the BRI. (Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari had attended the conference.) Then, when Chinese President Xi visited Kathmandu in October 2019, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation under the BRI.They agreed âto intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network with a view to significantly contributing to Nepalâs development agenda of graduating from a Least Developed Country,â according to a joint statement issued after Xiâs visit to Kathmandu.The Chinese side was keen to carry out the feasibility study of Kerung-Kathmandu railway under the BRI, the former finance ministry official said. âBut we have shifting priorities on selecting and negotiating other projects.âThe feasibility study of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway has already begun with a Chinese grant and it is expected to conclude by 2026 June, said Rohit Kumar Bisural, director general at Department of Railways.âAs per our agreement, the feasibility study of the cross border railway should be completed by 2026 June. There are various studies on the ground. Nepali engineers and technical staff are not directly involved but they are supporting the Chinese technicians as required. There are no glitches. Once the study is complete, we will jointly write a report,â said Bisural.A joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that no tangible progress has been made in the past seven years in implementing the BRI plan and no agreement is likely anytime soon either.âThis calls for consensus among the political parties as it is not just a matter of the government or one party,â said the joint-secretary. âThe BRI is unlikely to move forward in Nepal anytime soon because there is no discussion, consultation and consensus among the major parties.âMahendra Bahadur Pandey, former foreign minister and Nepalâs ex-ambassador to China, said many leaders and officials have blamed high-interest loans for not taking the BRI forward but that is not the reason.âWe do not complete projects on time. If we did, we could easily pay back the loan and interest to China and other lending countries. Our leaders also fear the reaction of other countries [to accepting any kind of Chinese help],â said Pandey.âWe have âfear psychosisâ while taking economic support,â he said. âNepalis are scared that India, China or the United States will be angry if the country takes support from any one of them.â âWe have to accept foreign support by taking neighbours and major powers into confidence,â Pandey said.

A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assemblyâs strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. âThe ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,â said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commissionâs decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciaryâs ambition. âWe have seen judicial activism for a long time,â Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. âSetting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.âHe said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most âanarchistâ and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciaryâs intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. âI see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,â he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the courtâs ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top courtâs door against the Election Commissionâs move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new partyâJanata Samajbadi Party. Yadav has termed the move unconstitutional.Observers say inter- and intra-party differences could have been sorted out through political negotiations. But several cases have landed in the court without any prior attempts to resolve them through dialogue. âIn principle, the court has a role in settling cases with complex legal and constitutional questions,â Raju Prasad Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer, told the Post. âCases of the political nature unnecessarily drag the judiciary into controversy as the defending side always criticises it.âWhen the Supreme Court overturned the twin decisions of then KP Sharma Oli government to dissolve the House, the CPN-UML had publicly criticised the decision. Similarly, the courtâs order to dissolve the Nepal Communist Party was termed as politically motivated and intended to favour Oli.In the views of the experts, such political cases are also wasting crucial time of the court. As such cases are given priority, decisions on other cases are delayed. âIt is not the judiciary that should be determining the political order. The political leadership should be doing so,â Balaram KC, a former justice, told the Post. âThe court should refrain from intervening in every political development. It must demarcate its jurisdiction.âKC says using the court to determine the political order is like taking paracetamol for a chronic disease; it may lower the fever and relieve the pain, but doesnât cure the disease. âPolitical problems should be resolved politically for a long-term solution,â he said.Observers say the way political parties are delegating responsibilities to the judiciary could spell disaster for democracy.âPakistan is a good example of what happens when the courtâs ambitions grow,â Karna, the political science professor, said. âWhy not correct it before it is too late?âLegal experts, however, do not see any threat of judicial supremacy. âThe court passes a verdict based on the law and constitution.

While some areas in the new map, especially the Kalapani region, were already a subject of dispute between the two countries, the communist government under Khadga Prasad Oli used its two-third parliamentary majority to include areas as far as Limpiyadhura unilaterally. For those who care to look at historical evidence, Nepal had never asserted its claim over Limpiyadhura, which was a territory lost after the Sugauli treaty of 1816. It was only in context to the existing dispute over the origin of the Kali river, which forms an international boundary in the treaty, that Nepal has claimed the Kalapani region and Lipulekh as its territory. India is cognisant of Nepalâs claim, and there is a joint committee looking at these boundary claims, with dialogue also happening at the Foreign Ministry level.Oliâs move in 2020 was not sudden. He had advisors who clearly understood that Nepal did not fulfil the prerequisites for a sovereign claim over most of those territories under the international law, which mandates physical control of the territory with a resident population under active governance. In fact, the only claim that merits a mention, and which Nepal has strongly put across to India, is the credible evidence regarding Nepal governing the villages in the Kalapani region until a few decades back. Specifications of the evidence aside, what is clear is Nepalâs claims in the Kalapani region have been acknowledged by India and well-documented by the joint committee.Oliâs come-back politicsWhen Oli came to power after the 2017 elections, he was riding on the wave of hyper-nationalism he had managed to stoke in the aftermath of the 2015 Indian blockade. While the Madhesh-based parties had indeed initiated the border obstruction to pressure Kathmanduâs political centre into conceding to their demands on the new constitution, the Narendra Modi government that had just come to power in New Delhi was blamed for actively enforcing the blockade. This is a claim India continues to deny. Whatever the truth, the blockade provided an opportune moment for Oli, whose political career was ailing at the time. He not only managed to sideline his bÃªte noire, Madhav Kumar Nepal, inside the party but he also struck a deal with politically insecure Pushpa Kamal Dahal to cobble up a two-thirds majority in the 2017 elections. What happened next has continued to haunt Nepalâs relationship with India. Oli, of all the communist leaders of his generation, best understands that if there is one issue that could mobilise the population across the country, it is our collective sense of insecurity against what we perceive to be Indiaâs over-reach and micro-management of Nepali politics. An average Nepali consumes Indian products, watches Bollywood movies, and supports an IPL team, all the while disdaining what they consider Indian interference in Nepali affairs.To be fair, such a mindset is not uncommon in a relationship between two countries that are disproportionate in geography, demography, economy or military capability. The tendency of the political class to weaponise public sentiments and insecurity against a larger neighbour for domestic electoral politics is not uncommon either. Autocratic and populist regimes across the world have consolidated their hold over power by stoking hate or fear against a perceived enemy state, painting their domestic opposition as weak and incapable of defending national interests. The definition of the enemy state and the national interests, in such cases, are often dictated by those in power to suit their divisive politics.When Oli refused to concede party or government leadership, Pushpa Kamal Dahal wrecked the mighty two-thirds government with the help of the disgruntled Madhav Kumar Nepal faction. Nepali Congress had no issues cashing in on this division, allowing the partyâs president, Sher Bahadur Deuba, to become the Prime Minister in July 2021. Upon becoming premier, Deuba and his coalition partner Dahal did all they could to normalise the relationship with New Delhi. There was little talk about the controversial map or the Eminent Personsâ Group (EPG) report, which had both become irritants in the bilateral relationship. After the 2022 elections, when Dahal became prime minister, New Delhi reciprocated by supporting Nepalâs ambitions to invest in large infrastructures and export power in the Indian market and potentially to Bangladesh. In doing so, New Delhi expected to regain some of the trust it had lost after the 2015 blockade. But Oli is a seasoned politician, a political maverick who can see two steps ahead of his competitors. He sensed Dahalâs distrust of his coalition partners, his personal anxieties and insecurity about the future of his party, which he felt was dealt an under-hand during the division of electoral seats. China, which had openly helped in cobbling up the previous left unity, has been more cautious this time. But there is plenty to read between frequent delegations shuttling between Kathmandu and Beijing over the past year. In any case, Oli convinced Dahal to leave the Nepali Congress coalition and continue in power with UMLâs support, with a vague promise of a long-term (electoral) partnership. Upendra Yadavâs Janata Samajwadi Party and the newly established Rastriya Swatantra Party were offered attractive cabinet positions in exchange for their support as well. Yadav, though, has left the coalition after the split of his party. Perilous brinkmanship If Pushpa Kamal Dahal believes that the UML chairman took all the trouble of bringing down the NC-led coalition just to watch the game from the sidelines, he needs to change his advisors. He may have generously allowed Dahal to continue on the throne, but it is clear who is setting the rules of the game. The recent decision by the current government to include Nepalâs new map in its currency note has Oliâs footprints all over it. However, his brinkmanship with India could have serious ramifications for the country. Not only will such misadventures jeopardise Nepalâs crucial economic interests, especially in the cross-border energy market where the private sector has invested billions of dollars, our ambition to access the trade route to Bangladesh and further east will not see the light of the day.As the war in Ukraine drags on and the conflict in Gaza worsens, Washington is already zooming out from the Indo-Pacific region. This could provide a much-needed conducive environment for a rapprochement between New Delhi and Beijing, something Indian Prime Minister Modi has hinted at recently. Nepali communists must read the changing geopolitical horizon and understand the days of playing one neighbour against the other may not last for long.

It paints a stark picture of Nepal's climate change situation and urges necessary intervention for the resource-crunch Himalayan nation.According to the survey, the economic losses in farm and off-farm in the last five years, as reported by households, excluding significant infrastructure damages, amounted to Rs415.44 billion.Experts say worse is yet to come.In Nepal, the number of households unaware of the consequences of climate change is significantly high.The survey shows that many households reported adverse weather changes. They noted that their water resources dried up, new diseases infected crops, productivity losses rose, and flowering and fruiting behaviours changed over the last two and a half decades. Major economic sectors and essential services like health and education in Nepal have felt the repercussions of extreme weather events linked to climate change, the survey said.The statistics office said the sampling used the total number of households from the population census. In total, 6.66 million individual households were included in the frame. The survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews from July to March 2023 among 6,508 households in 326 primary sampling units, encompassing all seven provinces. The statistics office said all the respondents were at least 45 years old and had lived in the survey area for 25 years, forming the sampling frame that included households meeting these criteria across Nepal.According to the survey, over the past 25 years, approximately 50 percent of households reported the emergence of new diseases in their crops, 53.9 percent observed the presence of new insects or pests affecting their crops, and 29.8 percent of households noted the appearance of new diseases in their livestock.Nepalâs agriculture sector is the mainstay of the countryâs economy. It contributes 24.60 percent to the country's GDP and employs over half of the population. The sector is mainly rainfed and heavily dependent on rainfall.When the rain fails to fall, the GDP takes a tumble. This dependence makes the country particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Rural areas experienced more new diseases affecting crops (55.9 percent) than urban areas (45.6 percent). The mountain region (68.7 percent), hill region (50.3 percent), and Tarai region (46.3 percent) also experienced an impact on crops due to new diseases. The survey report shows households in altitudes between 1,500 and 2,000 metres reported emergingnew crop diseases (60.2 percent) over the last 25 years. This shows diverse factors influence the prevalence of crop diseases across diverse geographical and climatic domains.âThe situation is alarming,â said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the National Statistics Office.âThe survey was intended to see peopleâs perception towards climate change, the most burning issue globally,â he said. Climate change literacy among people, mostly in rural areas, is shallow, but some exciting facts exist. âMost of the farmers surveyed are not clear whether climate change is bringing diseases and low yields, but at the same time, they have a coping mechanism knowingly or unknowingly,â said Regmi. For instance, farmers have changed the cropping pattern. âIf they think rainfall will be below normal or drought, they switch to another crop.âThe survey shows that 35.8 percent of the households surveyed were aware of climate change. Across all three geographical domains, the number of households unaware of climate change is significantly high, with the highest number being in the mountain region (70.9 percent). The sex-disaggregated data indicate that most male (61.3 precent) and female (74 percent) respondents were unaware of climate change impacts.The accessibility of early warning information among the people is weak.In urban municipalities, 16.3 percent of households received early-warning information, while 83.7 percent of the respondents did not receive any information regarding a disaster occurring shortly. Altitude-wise, households in low-altitude regions have received more early-warning information than those in the higher-altitude areas. The survey results show a significant impact of climate change on Nepal's water resources over the last 25 years. Climate change has notable implications for the country's energy transition, as it is actively pursuing a shift from conventional fossil fuels to renewable and sustainable energy sources. According to experts, the survey report is eye-opening. Nepal plans to generate 30,000MW of electricity by 2035, and the market for Nepal's hydropower is opening up in India and Bangladesh.Many households reported adverse changes and noted their water resources dried up. This phenomenon was observed across all domains and indicates a nationwide decrease in water availability. Respondents experienced a reduction in ground and surface water, primarily attributed to insufficient rainfall and increased drought incidents. According to the survey, 78.3 percent of households observed a decline in rivulets and streams, and 55 percent observed a decrease in wells, springs, and stone spouts. Likewise, 47.7 percent observed changes in water resources due to insufficient rainfall, followed by an increase in drought (20.3 percent), road construction (3.4 percent), deforestation and urbanisation (3.2 percent). In contrast, minimal respondents observed change due to population growth, earthquakes and landslides/soil erosion over the last 25 years.The survey said that over the past 25 years, Nepal has suffered from various natural disasters. Drought has emerged as a major disaster, affecting 44.87 percent households, and floods 13.87 percent. Storms have affected 9.9 percent of households, while landslides have affected 7.81 percent. Drought has been reported as the major disaster, affecting 65.4 percent of households, followed by diseases/insects at 54.3 percent, storms 46.2 percent, hailstorms 32.6 percent, floods 28.5 percent, cold waves 21.7 percent, landslides 21.5 percent, and inundation 17.5 percent. Thunderstorms impacted 15.7 percent of households, while occurrences of other disasters such as avalanches, GLOFs, and snowstorms were relatively lower. Climate change has significant and wide-ranging impacts on biodiversity in Nepal, a country known for its rich and diverse ecosystems, including the Himalayan mountains, tropical forests, and wetlands. Ten percent of households reported changes in flowering and fruiting behaviours affecting trees, shrubs, and fruiting plants, leading to reduced production and altered taste. Some of the critical impacts of climate change on biodiversity in Nepal are shifts in species distribution, habitat loss and fragmentation, altered breeding and migration patterns, invasive species, loss of endemic species, biodiversity conservation challenges, and human-wildlife conflict.Â  ","summary":"Climate change has profound impacts on Nepalâs economy, particularly on agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity, according to the latest survey report.The National Climate Change Survey 2022, the second of its kind, was released by the National Statistics Office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics.

He believes that by recognising our interconnectedness, we can work together toward positive change, promoting peace and harmony in a world that often feels divided.Chodak is a traditional Tibetan thangka master and contemporary artist. As a devoted Buddhist practitioner and direct descendant of the Repa Dorje Chang lineageâone of Jetsun Milarepaâs yogi disciplesâhe combines his rich heritage with modern artistic expressions.His solo art exhibition, âOpening Doors to Universal Inner Human Valueâ, is currently displayed at Kisimaaka Gallery in Thamel, Kathmandu. The exhibition, which started on April 6 and was initially planned to end on May 19, has been extended to May 23.In an interview with the Postâs Aarati Ray, Chodak shares insights on his art styles, the importance of âinterconnectednessâ in todayâs world and his new âwearableâ art collection.What styles of art do you create?I create various types of art, from Thangka and Tibetan to modern styles. My work combines Newa Paubha art, Kashmirâs Alchi art and Tibetan art, focusing on female energy as a divine source of wisdom.Can you tell us about your project with Kisimaaka Lines on wearable art?Iâm collaborating with Kisimaaka Lines on a special project called the âMeditative Collectionâ. We design 100% cashmere shawls adorned with my Himalayan art. This project combines Himalayan beauty and elegance with colours, reminding us of universal human values of joy and harmony. By creating these wearable art collections, we aim to make Himalayan art more accessible and share the message of Himalayan culture globally.Your paintings often feature the theme of âInterconnectedness of Existence'. Can you explain this idea?In everything we doâwhat we eat, wear, think, and feelâthereâs a theme of interconnectedness. Weâre all connected and everything affects everything else. Good thoughts lead to good outcomes and bad thoughts lead to bad outcomes. Through my paintings, I want to emphasise this idea. Understanding our interconnectedness can help remind us that our actions impact others and that we share common human experiences and needs. This awareness can develop empathy, compassion and cooperation within us, reducing conflicts and helping to rebuild trust and unity. My art reminds us that weâre all connected and that practising kindness and compassion can bring us peace. In the digital and technology era, where people are becoming more isolated from each other, how important do you think staying connected is?Even in the digital world, I see interconnectedness. While there are negative influences, they still show how connected we all are, though in a less positive way. We need to spread positive messages more to harness the good side of interconnectedness.If we truly understand and practice interconnectedness, we can overcome jealousy, violence and negative feelings, leading to a world without conflict. We all feel pain, experience hunger and need water to survive. We must realise that at our core and soul, weâre not so different.Do you ever feel pressured to conform to traditional or modern art styles?I donât feel pressured to conform to just one style. People often see traditional art as only depicting gods and deities, making it seem distant to the younger generation. However, I believe that Thangka art, traditional art and modern art all share the same essence.Contemporary art connects with our modern lifestyle and thoughts, while traditional art reflects human lifestyle and consciousness. On a deeper level, theyâre all the same, so I use different approaches in my paintings to convey the same message.Traditional and contemporary art can communicate messages about good and bad deeds, showing their similarities. Therefore, I don't think we need to stick to or conform to just one style. How do you view âmeditativenessâ in art?To me, meditativeness in art means cultivating good practices and habits. In a world of pessimism, itâs easy to fall into negative thoughts and behaviours. Practising meditative art involves propagating positive thinking and practices.With a free and boundless mind, there are no limitations. Barriers that once seemed insurmountable disappear, allowing us to see the world in a new light. Everything coexists without differentiation or separation in absolute freedom and unity. We should understand and appreciate the interconnectedness of all things and realise that we are part of a greater whole. What message are you trying to convey through the themes of female energy and divinity in your paintings?In the past, women and femininity were often looked down upon. However, both men and women have feminine and masculine qualities. We need to stop creating divisions based on these qualities. Itâs high time we start celebrating femininity and women.Motherhood is the ultimate symbol of love. Even Buddha said that men and women are equal. For example, in my painting âOnenessâ, I try to show a harmonious balance of masculine and feminine energies. When we move beyond our differences, we can appreciate and respect each other more deeply, allowing these energies to unite and flow beautifully.Just as a peacock uses poison to grow vibrant feathers, the snake skin on the female form in my painting represents transforming negativity into something positive.

I contributed to Wave magazine, ECS and other publications, covering issues related to youth and culture.What is your first novel âRadha: Wrath of the Maejuâ about?The story centres on a girl named Radha, who once served as the Royal Kumari of Patan.

Exploring a wide range of books, both within and beyond your interests, can greatly enhance your writing skills.Reading books related to your field can significantly improve your writing process.

Self-censorship can hinder progress, so itâs crucial to write freely and confidently.What inspires you to write?I donât have a specific individual as my source of motivation.

However, while working on my recent book, I was particularly inspired by the works of Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman.Terry Pratchettâs Discworld novel series stands out as particularly satisfying.

Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal himself had held meetings with ruling parties and also the main opposition Nepali Congress to find a way out. However, the ruling parties and the Congress couldnât agree on terms of reference of the parliamentary probe committee.The ruling parties agreed to constitute the parliamentary panel to investigate the embezzlement of savings in the cooperatives and recommend action against the individuals, institutions and companies benefited illegally. However, the Congress wanted the probe focused on Rabi Lamichhane, erstwhile managing director at the Gorkha Media Network, and others who illegally benefited from Supreme, Suryadarshan, and Swarnalaxmi, among other cooperatives. The ruling parties, particularly Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), did not agree to the proposal to focus only on the cooperatives where Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane is allegedly involved. âOur demand is to constitute a parliamentary committee to investigate the problems facing the cooperative sector, including Rabi Lamichhaneâs involvement in the alleged fraud. The ruling alliance is not ready for it. It wants a panel that will broadly investigate the problems in the sector without addressing our concerns. The alliance is trying to divert attention from the main issue,â said Prakash Sharan Mahat, the Nepali Congress spokesperson explaining why there could be no agreement.The ruling parties, however, say the Congress, guided by a mala fide intent, has been insisting on an investigation committee focusing on three or four cooperatives. âWe had just demands: first, our chairperson must be allowed to clarify on the allegations in Parliament. Second, as problems have been seen in several cooperatives, there must be a broader investigation,â said Manish Jha, an RSP lawmaker. âWhy just focus on three or four cooperatives? Why not probe the cooperatives that are led by Congress leaders?âThe meeting of the House of Representatives postponed for 4 pm was held two hours later. No sooner had the meeting commenced, the Congress started chanting slogans. Amid the obstruction, Speaker Devraj Ghimire read out the letters from the Presidentâs Office regarding the authentication of a bill and addition of ministers from the newly formed Janata Samajbadi Party. The situation got tense when Ghimire asked Lamichhane to go to the rostrum and address the meeting amid the protest of the main opposition.The Congress lawmakers had already gathered at the well and were raising slogans demanding a parliamentary probe into Lamichhane, who is accused of embezzling funds of several credit cooperatives.After the Speaker allowed the minister to go to the rostrum, the Congress lawmakers and senior CPN-UML leaders, who were on the front row of the ruling bench, engaged in heated verbal exchanges. The situation escalated after UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Congress vice president Dhanraj Gurung engaged in an intense argument. Other lawmakers from the two sides subsequently joined the resulting scuffle. Even Prime Minister Dahal and Minister for Communications and Information Technology Rekha Sharma engaged in an argument with the Congress lawmakers.Both sides have pointed fingers at each other for the tensions. âThe situation escalated after the Congress lawmakers tried to stand in front of the rows designated for the ruling parties in order to prevent Home Minister Lamichhane from heading to the rostrum,â said Sharma. âThe Congress is responsible for the unparliamentary behaviour.â The UML has demanded an apology from the Congress, claiming its lawmakers misbehaved with Oli.The Congress, however, said the Speakerâs irresponsible move [of inviting the home minister to the rostrum] was responsible for the unpleasant incident in the House. âThe Speaker is guided by partisan interests. It was wrong of him to invite the home minister to address the House when the opposition was obstructing the House,â said Mahat. The next House meeting has been called for 11 am Friday.Earlier, the meeting of the National Assembly was also adjourned until 1:15 pm on Friday following obstruction from the Nepali Congress.The main opposition has been obstructing the budget session of Parliament since the first day of the session that commenced on May 10. However, the opposition parties had allowed the President to table the governmentâs policies and programmes. The RSP has said they will not agree to any probe panel targeting its chairperson. âThe probe panel will be formed only if there is an agreement to investigate the Congress President [Sher Bahadur Deuba] and his son,â said Jha. âTo challenge our party, those who have been in power for decades need to come clean.â ","summary":"The parliamentary meeting on Thursday that was expected to end the ongoing impasse ended up in a scuffle between the ruling and opposition lawmakers.The House meeting called for 11 in the morning was postponed until 4 pm in an attempt to find a meeting point among the parties over the formation of a parliamentary panel to probe Home Minister Rabi Lamichhaneâs embezzlement of cooperatives funds. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal himself had held meetings with ruling parties and also the main opposition Nepali Congress to find a way out. However, the ruling parties and the Congress couldnât agree on terms of reference of the parliamentary probe committee.The ruling parties agreed to constitute the parliamentary panel to investigate the embezzlement of savings in the cooperatives and recommend action against the individuals, institutions and companies benefited illegally. However, the Congress wanted the probe focused on Rabi Lamichhane, erstwhile managing director at the Gorkha Media Network, and others who illegally benefited from Supreme, Suryadarshan, and Swarnalaxmi, among other cooperatives. The ruling parties, particularly Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), did not agree to the proposal to focus only on the cooperatives where Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane is allegedly involved. âOur demand is to constitute a parliamentary committee to investigate the problems facing the cooperative sector, including Rabi Lamichhaneâs involvement in the alleged fraud. The ruling alliance is not ready for it. It wants a panel that will broadly investigate the problems in the sector without addressing our concerns.

On April 26, 2021, the Oli-led government allowed the use of the land exempting the ceiling for the deal. However, the constitutional bench, headed by Bishowambar Prasad Shrestha, ruled that Oliâs Cabinet decision contravened Section 12 (C) of the Land Act 1964 and was immature.The court also ruled against allowing the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate to swap land exceeding the legal ownership ceiling in any other place within Koshi Province, highlighting the legal implications of the land reforms.The requirement to first examine the specific landâs detailed area has been upheld by the Supreme Courtâs constitutional bench in the full text of the verdict. The land that is being considered for a swap ought to yield comparable value, read the courtâs final verdict. But the tea estate is trying to swap its land in Birtamod, reportedly valued at Rs200 million per bigha, with low-price land in Prithvinagar, Jhapa.While considering a swap, there must be a feasibility study to assess the new locationâs production capacity. Technical expertsâ advice ought to be followed in this context, reads the full text of the court.âIt [the court verdict] has not just confirmed how wrong and corrupt the decisions and law amendments made by the government of the time were, but has also exposed policy-level corruption. There is no longer any doubt that such a decision is unfair and ill-intended. Therefore, further investigation is warranted,â Thapa wrote. When the Congress general secretary tried to bash the UML over the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate incident, UML chair Oli accused the Congress of selling 70 bighas of the estate in return for hefty commissions. Oli made the accusation while addressing the parliamentary party meeting of the UML on Wednesday. âThe Congress should be careful when commenting on the UML on the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate,â Oli said. âThey once sold 51 bighas of land and later 19 bighas in the name of land swapping, just for commissions.âWhen the government in 2018 tried to swap the Giri Bandhu land, the court stopped it, saying there were no legal provisions to do so. âAbiding by the courtâs ruling, we later formulated the law, but the court now has found the fault with it,â Oli said.The Congress has been cornering Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane over his involvement in the co-operatives fundsâ embezzlement. With this agenda the party also has been disrupting Parliament. But the ruling party leaders accuse the Congress of being biassed against Lamichhane. And it is Oli and his CPN-UML party that has come to Lamichhaneâs most resolute defence.The Congress parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday decided to take up the issue of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in a serious manner.But Congress leaders deny that bringing up the tea estate issue is its calculated strategy to corner the ruling parties. âThe parliamentary party meeting decided to take up this issue given the gravity of the matter. There is no ulterior motive,â Sanjay Gautam, a Congress lawmaker, told the Post. Meanwhile, Gautam also said the party will study Oliâs allegations against his party.

Not only Thapa but most senior Congress leaders were members of Parliament at the time of the amendment.âThough one can question those involved in the law amendment on moral grounds, they cannot be held accountable on legal grounds,â Om Parkash Aryal, an advocate who was among those challenging the Oli governmentâs decision in the court, told the Post. âIn such instances, itâs the government that makes such a decision which comes under the question.âKing Mahendraâs implementation of land reforms in 2021 BS, through enacting the Land Act 2021 BS, was a momentous step.

Landlords close to the then royal palace were taken into confidence for the lawâs implementation, and the palace made it clear that land used for industrial and agricultural purposes would not be nationalised.According to Section 12 of the Land Act 2021, land used for industrial, agricultural, cooperative farming, educational, or medical purposes is not put under the limit.Budhkaran Rajbanshi, a landlord in Jhapa considered close to the royal palace, was informed in prior that if he established a tea estate, the land beyond the ceiling would not be nationalised.To save his land, he founded the Budhkaran Tea Estate there. Three additional Jhapa landlords, the Giri brothers (Prem Kumar Giri, Krishna Kumar Giri, and Trilochan Giri) also received similar information.

The situation now is different. Itâs now an organised commercial informal trade happening at a large scale, according to a research finding. Rice appears to be a key commodity âhighly informallyâ imported from India to Nepal. The research, âDynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,â prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE) in partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute, shows that only 40 percent of rice is imported to Nepal from India through a formal channel.Indiaâs share in Nepalâs imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the shares and volumes of informal trade are likely to be higher.The research has pointed out that informal trade has thrived after the imposition of a 9 percent agriculture reform fee and a 2.5 percent advanced income tax, leading to a total duty of 11.5 percent on rice imports. In the current fiscal year, the government also introduced a 13 percent VAT on some vegetables, including onions and potatoes.With this variation, the price differences between Nepal and India become 18-20 percent, or rice in India becomes cheaper by at least 18 percent.The paper said that India's ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food from the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India Nepal in the south, east and west. According to a separate report by the International Food Policy Research Institute, carrying or informally transferring goods has become a full-time profession for many poor families living close to the towns along the Nepal-India border.âCarriers,â many of them women, collect the goods on the Indian side and bring them in via the open border, escaping the formal customs entry points, sometimes on foot, sometimes on bicycles and motorbikes, and always at their own risk.Presenting the report titled âInsights into Informal Cross-Border Trade in Agri-Food Commodities in South Asiaâ, Dikshya Singh, programme coordinator at SAWTEE, a South Asian think tank based in Kathmandu, said the export duty imposed by India on rice in September 2022 followed by an export ban on non-basmati rice in July 2023, fueled the informal trade.The report said that rice, vegetables, chemical fertilisers, and seeds are other agricultural products and inputs that have been largely coming through informal channels.The study reveals that this informal trade is dominated by a small group of traders forming an oligopoly. Moreover, the study indicates that large-scale informal trade is controlled by mafia-style syndicates with political backing.Anand Bagaria, managing director of Nimbus Holdings, said Nepal needs proactive measures to deal with informal cross-border trade. âSince we cannot influence our neighbouring countriesâ policies, Nepal needs to be clear about what could be the right balance between inflation, government revenue, and mitigating quality-related risks while dealing with informal trade.âSingh said Nepal heavily relies on informal trade to meet its need for agricultural inputs.The report attributes the illegal import of chemical fertiliser to the persistent shortage in Nepal and cheaper rates in India.The report showed that Nepal needs 800,000 tonnes of chemical fertiliser annually. The country has been able to import 400,000 tonnes formally, and an estimated 200,000 tonnes come through informal channels. According to the report, farmers in Nepal have been informally importing a variety of seeds that are not available locally, especially hybrid seeds of vegetables, mainly due to import restrictions and to avoid non-tariff requirements.SAWTEE conducted surveys at nine customs points, including Birgunj, Bhairahawa, Biratnagar, Nepalgunj, Kakarbhitta, Krishnanagar, Jaleshwar, Suthauli, Maheshpur, and Bhadrapur and the border crossings in their periphery.âThe informal trade between Nepal and India is as big as formal trade,â said Paras Kharel, executive director of SAWTEE. Purushottam Ojha, former commerce secretary, said that gold and silver, areca (palm) nuts, onion and garlic, poppy seed, edible oil, and black pepper are informally exported to India from Nepal. âInformal trade is rising between Nepal and India because of the price differences caused mainly due tariff advantage and tariff differences and non-tariff barriers for formal export.ââThe misdeclaration of exported goods from Nepal to India needs to be addressed,â he said. For instance, Nepal exports cabbage to India from Koshi province. As India has restricted the import of other types of vegetables from Nepal, traders are exporting other vegetables like okra, chayote, and chilli under the name of cabbage, Ojha said.Article 2 of the trade treaty between Nepal and India, and the agreement on cooperation to control unauthorised trade talks about controlling informal trade. âDuring the bilateral discussion, be it commerce level, inter-government committee meetings, or customs director-level meetings, either annually or bi-annually, they discuss informal trade. But there hasnât been any serious discussion about controlling informal trade,â Ojha said.Nepal raised issues like the informal import of agricultural goods from India to Nepal, while the Indian side brought up issues like the informal import of goods including areca nuts, edible oil, poppy seeds, and black pepper, but no concrete solution has been found yet, according to Ojha. Sabnam Shivakoti, joint secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, pointed out that cross-border trade that was done traditionally due to social ties across borders is not the same as the organised commercial informal trade that is happening now on a large scale. âThis has been affecting agricultural and industrial sectors as they have to compete with cheap imports.âAccording to Shivakoti, an import restriction on dairy products was announced in February 2024 to protect domestic farmers and the dairy industry, but that led to formal imports being diverted to informal channels.Trade experts said that as the Indian government is providing eight types of subsidies on agricultural products, as a result, Nepali products become less competitive even in the domestic market, raising the informal trade to Nepal.

Nepal designated its Embassy in Copenhagen (Denmark) as a non-resident mission to Lithuania, and the Lithuanian Embassy in New Delhi represents Lithuania in Nepal. There have been minimal contacts and exchanges between the two countries. Trade, tourism and investment relations between the two countries are at a very low level. The Post caught up with Diana Mickeviciene, the ambassador of Lithuania to India, during her recent visit to Nepal to discuss Lithuaniaâs cutting-edge technology and its graduation to a developed economy, as well as bilateral economic, trade and tourism relations between the two small nations. Excerpts:Tell us about the bilateral economic and trade relations between Nepal and Lithuania.We are both small countries, far away from each other. But some trade is going both ways. For instance, we have exported medical cotton to Nepal in large quantities. And we have been buying tea and spices from Nepal. However, the trade amount is not very big. I think the biggest exchange we already have is the trade of services. Currently, there are some businesses that are trading services which are not reflected in the conventional trade balance. Our (Lithuania) economy is small but very innovative and digitalised. My country has gone far in more than 30 years of transformation. When we liberated ourselves from the Soviet Union, we were in shambles. Our economy was down completely, and people were very poor. But now we have graduated into a developed economy. We are considered a high-income country. So I think we've come a very long way. And what I see is Nepal is going a similar way. Nepal started slightly later, and the country is much bigger, with ten times Lithuaniaâs population. So challenges are, of course, more. And I think education is a big challenge. As we have done this transformation, we continue on digitalisation and on so many modernisation paths. This is the area we can help in advising and guiding because we just did it ourselves and we know how it works. I have been meeting a number of ministers to see which areas the Lithuanian expertise and experience could be best applied in the context of Nepal. So that's a new chapter that I want to open. You met Rekha Sharma, the minister for Communication, Information, and Technology. Can you share what issues were discussed?Since Lithuania ranks sixth in terms of cybersecurity globally, this is one area specifically where our expertise and knowledge could be very applicable, as Nepal has adopted a cybersecurity strategy and guidelines and is embarking on creating the National Cybersecurity Center. We have many companies which work in that area providing services to many others. For instance, the National Cybersecurity Center in Bhutan and the National Institution in Charge of Cybersecurity in Bangladesh were designed by a Lithuanian company. So we think that is what works well in this context. We would be happy to assist Nepal in the cybersecurity area. We could bring a group of experts to advise and guide Nepal. Exports and imports between Nepal and Lithuania have been declining. What should be done to boost bilateral trade between the two small nations for mutual benefit? The trade volumes are up and down and fluctuate year-on-year and this happens with many other countries. During Covid, we exported pharmaceutical agents for vaccines and the trade went up. But later, it declined because there was no need for it. So what we are trying to build now is high-tech cooperation which means the exchange of technology and services. This is one of the sectors which Nepal and Lithuania can exchange in future. We will never measure our relationship in conventional trade as the distance between the two countries is far. Also, nowadays, many producers who used to export have relocated to other regions and are producing in another country, thus changing the export origin, but the product remains Lithuanian. But of course, we need to work and check how our ICT sectors can work together. It's mostly private businesses. But as I said, as a very small but very dynamic government, we also have government-to-government proposals and solutions. So that's why I'm meeting in the ministry and trying to see the needs. We have a super strong laser industry. For decades, we have developed very good laser bays. The screens of an iPhone are cut by using a Lithuanian laser because we supply those laser cutting technologies to iPhone manufacturersâ10 percent of the world's scientific lasers are from Lithuania. Our biometrics, which is part of a robotics system, companies have been working around the world and in South Asia helping to verify digital identities like those on voter lists or other registers. In India, the Aadhaar system has a tiny bit of Lithuanian technology used in it. So, we will always have a niche role, but whenever this expertise is needed, then we can really provide it.A small number of tourists visit Nepal from Lithuania. How can Nepal attract tourists from Lithuania?I have visited Nepal as a tourist twice, long ago and I think all of my friends have been to Nepal. We are a very small country and will always be small if you compare it to a much bigger country. Nevertheless, to attract tourists, there is a need to advertise a little more as I think Nepal has excellent things to offer for a reasonable price which is also very important. For now, I can see that almost every Lithuanian can afford a trip to Nepal. The Nepali embassy and travel agencies could also do a little more advertising. I, as a friend of Nepal, am very happy to say and testify to anyone who asks that it's a great country to visit. Be it cultural and religious tourism, mountain trekking, spa, or wellness, I think Nepal has everything. It's easy to reach because connectivity is really good. And it's easy to stay and enjoy as the country is not so super expensive, it's affordable. So what kinds of products are in demand in Nepal and Lithuania? I think from Lithuania it would be electronic devices, digital devices which are needed now in everyday manufacturing processes. For instance, in telematics, any production line with many vehicles or equipment must monitor how they all work. This is where Lithuania is again pioneering. We have 30 percent of India's market in the hardware of telematics. So a Lithuanian company is successfully working in India. It will be IT applications or IT-enabling hardware solutions that we are very good at. From Nepal I think lots of traditional exports could also be interesting as our way of thinking and understanding of fashion and interior is quite similar. For instance, we are a wooden culture. So for us, the idea of a cosy house is wood and textiles, which Nepal produces, which has an excellent market in Lithuania. But in the future, I think, with technologies, ecological farming products will be in demand as the population becomes aware of health and sustainability requirements and not just requirements but use for own consumption. So that's where anything that is ecological and sustainable gets traction, and that's a high-value thing already. It's not a simple potato or tomato, but it's made of ecologically grown products. So how can Nepal and Lithuania work together for mutual benefit? We are here to learn about the changes in Nepal, about the future needs, and about the areas where we are good. We are also here to exchange opinions on issues of global concern, like climate change, which has highly affected both Nepal and Lithuania. None of our countries are great polluters. We, too, are a very minor polluter, much below our obligations, in fact. So how small countries can be together to make sure that the world is really against further global warming is important. Further, I also stress to the Nepal government that we are very grateful for a very principled stance of Nepal vis-a-vis the Russian war against Ukraine. It's a war which is just next door, it's 500 kilometres from my home. Nepal, on a number of occasions, voted in the United Nations to say no to aggression. So I think we are also very grateful and appreciative. Also, we have this unique connection that I wanted to tell, which is a tiny, small, quaint language which was preserved in villages of our country as a very antique, ancient language that is very close to Sanskrit. Since Lithuanian is considered the closest living language, a sister language of Sanskrit. We have started this collaboration with academic institutions here, and Raghunath Adhikari from the Tribhuvan University defended his dissertation on the issue of linguistic similarities last year. And he is the first PhD in Asia to actually do this. So we are happy that we have this connection and he has become a friend of Lithuania. Through him we know about what is happening at the university. Tribhuvan University already has a Memorandum of Understanding with Vilnius University, which is our oldest and main university. So academic collaboration is also very important because there are people working also on technologies, and know-how, which ultimately lead to business cooperation.Â  ","summary":"Nepal and Lithuania established diplomatic ties in February 2005. Nepal designated its Embassy in Copenhagen (Denmark) as a non-resident mission to Lithuania, and the Lithuanian Embassy in New Delhi represents Lithuania in Nepal. There have been minimal contacts and exchanges between the two countries. Trade, tourism and investment relations between the two countries are at a very low level. The Post caught up with Diana Mickeviciene, the ambassador of Lithuania to India, during her recent visit to Nepal to discuss Lithuaniaâs cutting-edge technology and its graduation to a developed economy, as well as bilateral economic, trade and tourism relations between the two small nations. Excerpts:Tell us about the bilateral economic and trade relations between Nepal and Lithuania.We are both small countries, far away from each other. But some trade is going both ways. For instance, we have exported medical cotton to Nepal in large quantities. And we have been buying tea and spices from Nepal. However, the trade amount is not very big. I think the biggest exchange we already have is the trade of services. Currently, there are some businesses that are trading services which are not reflected in the conventional trade balance. Our (Lithuania) economy is small but very innovative and digitalised. My country has gone far in more than 30 years of transformation. When we liberated ourselves from the Soviet Union, we were in shambles. Our economy was down completely, and people were very poor. But now we have graduated into a developed economy. We are considered a high-income country. So I think we've come a very long way. And what I see is Nepal is going a similar way. Nepal started slightly later, and the country is much bigger, with ten times Lithuaniaâs population. So challenges are, of course, more. And I think education is a big challenge. As we have done this transformation, we continue on digitalisation and on so many modernisation paths. This is the area we can help in advising and guiding because we just did it ourselves and we know how it works. I have been meeting a number of ministers to see which areas the Lithuanian expertise and experience could be best applied in the context of Nepal. So that's a new chapter that I want to open. You met Rekha Sharma, the minister for Communication, Information, and Technology. Can you share what issues were discussed?Since Lithuania ranks sixth in terms of cybersecurity globally, this is one area specifically where our expertise and knowledge could be very applicable, as Nepal has adopted a cybersecurity strategy and guidelines and is embarking on creating the National Cybersecurity Center. We have many companies which work in that area providing services to many others. For instance, the National Cybersecurity Center in Bhutan and the National Institution in Charge of Cybersecurity in Bangladesh were designed by a Lithuanian company. So we think that is what works well in this context. We would be happy to assist Nepal in the cybersecurity area. We could bring a group of experts to advise and guide Nepal. Exports and imports between Nepal and Lithuania have been declining. What should be done to boost bilateral trade between the two small nations for mutual benefit? The trade volumes are up and down and fluctuate year-on-year and this happens with many other countries. During Covid, we exported pharmaceutical agents for vaccines and the trade went up. But later, it declined because there was no need for it. So what we are trying to build now is high-tech cooperation which means the exchange of technology and services. This is one of the sectors which Nepal and Lithuania can exchange in future. We will never measure our relationship in conventional trade as the distance between the two countries is far. Also, nowadays, many producers who used to export have relocated to other regions and are producing in another country, thus changing the export origin, but the product remains Lithuanian. But of course, we need to work and check how our ICT sectors can work together. It's mostly private businesses. But as I said, as a very small but very dynamic government, we also have government-to-government proposals and solutions. So that's why I'm meeting in the ministry and trying to see the needs. We have a super strong laser industry. For decades, we have developed very good laser bays. The screens of an iPhone are cut by using a Lithuanian laser because we supply those laser cutting technologies to iPhone manufacturersâ10 percent of the world's scientific lasers are from Lithuania. Our biometrics, which is part of a robotics system, companies have been working around the world and in South Asia helping to verify digital identities like those on voter lists or other registers. In India, the Aadhaar system has a tiny bit of Lithuanian technology used in it. So, we will always have a niche role, but whenever this expertise is needed, then we can really provide it.A small number of tourists visit Nepal from Lithuania. How can Nepal attract tourists from Lithuania?I have visited Nepal as a tourist twice, long ago and I think all of my friends have been to Nepal. We are a very small country and will always be small if you compare it to a much bigger country. Nevertheless, to attract tourists, there is a need to advertise a little more as I think Nepal has excellent things to offer for a reasonable price which is also very important. For now, I can see that almost every Lithuanian can afford a trip to Nepal. The Nepali embassy and travel agencies could also do a little more advertising. I, as a friend of Nepal, am very happy to say and testify to anyone who asks that it's a great country to visit. Be it cultural and religious tourism, mountain trekking, spa, or wellness, I think Nepal has everything. It's easy to reach because connectivity is really good. And it's easy to stay and enjoy as the country is not so super expensive, it's affordable. So what kinds of products are in demand in Nepal and Lithuania? I think from Lithuania it would be electronic devices, digital devices which are needed now in everyday manufacturing processes. For instance, in telematics, any production line with many vehicles or equipment must monitor how they all work. This is where Lithuania is again pioneering. We have 30 percent of India's market in the hardware of telematics. So a Lithuanian company is successfully working in India. It will be IT applications or IT-enabling hardware solutions that we are very good at. From Nepal I think lots of traditional exports could also be interesting as our way of thinking and understanding of fashion and interior is quite similar. For instance, we are a wooden culture. So for us, the idea of a cosy house is wood and textiles, which Nepal produces, which has an excellent market in Lithuania. But in the future, I think, with technologies, ecological farming products will be in demand as the population becomes aware of health and sustainability requirements and not just requirements but use for own consumption. So that's where anything that is ecological and sustainable gets traction, and that's a high-value thing already. It's not a simple potato or tomato, but it's made of ecologically grown products. So how can Nepal and Lithuania work together for mutual benefit? We are here to learn about the changes in Nepal, about the future needs, and about the areas where we are good. We are also here to exchange opinions on issues of global concern, like climate change, which has highly affected both Nepal and Lithuania. None of our countries are great polluters. We, too, are a very minor polluter, much below our obligations, in fact. So how small countries can be together to make sure that the world is really against further global warming is important.

He says he isnât addicted to itâhe barely experienced any withdrawal syndrome when he quit it last year, before picking it up again. Amit, who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym to protect his privacy, says he vapes just because he wants to.Unlike Amit, Rita (name changed), who is 21, switched to vaping after smoking tobacco for a while. Rita says that since she hopes to quit smoking altogether, she doesnât mind the Nepal governmentâs intention to put a blanket ban on e-cigarettes. But doctors say a ban may lead those who smoke vape to switch to smoking tobacco again.As debates continue around the world about the pros and cons of vaping compared to smoking tobacco, the Nepal government earlier this month announced that it was banning e-cigarettes. The National Health Education, Information, and Communication Center (NHEICC), under the Department of Health Services, says it is seeking help from other ministries to enforce the ban. While some vape users the Post talked to said that the ban would help them quit smoking altogether, there are other aspects of the ban that need a more careful consideration for youthsâ health, experts say.Meanwhile, some other users said banning vapes makes little sense as tobacco cigarettes are still freely available in the market for people of all age groups. If the government is so concerned about youthsâ health, they question, shouldnât stricter measures be taken to ensure that minors, for instance, donât purchase cigarettes?Nepal is not the only country to ban e-cigarettes of late. Most recently, the British prime minister announced a ban on all disposable cigarettes, citing risks to youth health following a significant rise in vaping.There are 33 countries that have altogether banned the sale of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), while according to a WHO report published in early 2024, around 74 countries have no regulations on the sale of e-cigarettes.Most countries in the world have a legal age to purchase traditional cigarettes, according to the WHO, while 88 countries have no minimum age limit to buy e-cigarettes.Moreover, the WHO has repeatedly urged countries around the globe to reduce the spread of e-cigarettes. A call to action was published in December last year, urging governments to strengthen regulations on e-cigarettes.Nepal, meanwhile, has no regulations on e-cigarettes. While they havenât banned e-cigarettes outright, countries like China have imposed a number of regulations, including licensing to sell the products publicly, ban on flavoured products, and imposition of taxes.In a study on the prevalence of e-cigarette usage among undergraduate students in Kathmandu, 21.2 percent respondents said they never used e-cigarettes, while five percent said they currently used cigarettes. An estimation of global e-cigarette use put the number of its users at 82 million worldwide, 14.2 million of them in South Asia.Most countries cite e-cigarettes as a contributor to youth smoking.Nepalis do not need to produce an ID to purchase either tobacco cigarettes or e-cigarettes. Amit, for instance, was still a minor when he started vaping. That these harmful products are freely available to people of all age groups goes against the Tobacco Products (Control and Regulatory) Act, 2068 (2011), which says that it is illegal to sell tobacco products to those below the age of 18.âA stricter control on the sale of tobacco products is essential to curb smoking among youths,â says Dr Bhakta Bahadur KC, chief of Health Promotion and Tobacco Control at NHEICC. KC adds that to prevent minors and pregnant women, who are more vulnerable to the risks of smoking, from purchasing cigarettes, local governments should introduce provisions on licensing. âThis is one way to control smoking in vulnerable groups,â says KC.Moreover, banning e-cigarettes fully may not be possible as they are widely sold through social media and smuggled products might still be available for purchase online.

With the ban on vapes, youths may find themselves attracted to tobacco smoking, as a significant number of vape users, like Rita, turn to e-cigarettes, supposedly to protect themselves from the harmful impacts of tobacco cigarettes.âBanning e-cigarette is not a cure-all,â Uprety says. âIt is also vital to focus on handling the nicotine-dependence syndrome which both tobacco and e-cigarette users experience.âBoth tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes contain nicotine, a highly addictive chemical, but tobacco cigarettes contain higher amounts of toxic chemicals than e-cigarettes. But studies show that e-cigarettes are especially harmful for youths as they affect adolescent brain development due to exposure to nicotine, and the aerosol in e-cigarettes has known effects on lungs.Further, there is little knowledge about the long-term impacts of e-cigarettes as itâs a relatively new technology.âI will never say banning e-cigarettes is a bad thing.

It is an important move,â Uprety says. âBut we also need to conduct a pilot study to figure out the repercussions of a potential ban.â "},{"hash":"32104834055959b094125de256188f02af795a2e657bc95d1e2257342194b8dc","title":"57-districts-report-dengue-infection","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/health/2024/05/14/57-districts-report-dengue-infection","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/thumb9-1715650595.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1715644800000,"source":"kp","category":"health","content":"As pre-monsoon rains pick up pace, concerns mount about an imminent outbreak of the dengue disease.

The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said that 57 districts, including three districts of Kathmandu ValleyâKathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapurâhave already reported cases of dengue infection.âOn average, around 50 people across the country are becoming infected with the dengue virus every week,â said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. âThe number could rise in the coming days, as pre-monsoon rainfall activities have recently increased.âPost-monsoon is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease throughout the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Around 1,000 people have already been infected with the deadly disease since the start of 2024, according to officials.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of people infected with the deadly virus do not show any symptoms. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus throughout the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Experts say that this is the right time to prepare and prevent possible outbreaks in the coming days.They say that it will be too late if they wait for a massive outbreak. Authorities concerned should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance and take other measures to cut the risk, according to them.

Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishraâs early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, âThe Sewing Tinâ, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Postâs Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. Itâs been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdainâs groundbreaking book, âKitchen Confidentialâ, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorousâit involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of âThe Sewing Tinâ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staffâeconomic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriersâI had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at âJunoonâ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant âThe Sewing Tinâ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.âThe Sewing Tinâ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing suppliesâsomething uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?Iâm on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But Iâm still learning and want to explore more of Nepalâs cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because itâs got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.Iâve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their foodâitâs like theyâre sharing a story. Theyâve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. Itâs okay to give helpful advice but donât be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldnât also just copy whatâs popular, they should cook what they truly love.

A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishraâs early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, âThe Sewing Tinâ, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Postâs Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. Itâs been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdainâs groundbreaking book, âKitchen Confidentialâ, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorousâit involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of âThe Sewing Tinâ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staffâeconomic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriersâI had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at âJunoonâ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant âThe Sewing Tinâ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.âThe Sewing Tinâ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing suppliesâsomething uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?Iâm on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But Iâm still learning and want to explore more of Nepalâs cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because itâs got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.Iâve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their foodâitâs like theyâre sharing a story. Theyâve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. Itâs okay to give helpful advice but donât be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldnât also just copy whatâs popular, they should cook what they truly love. Thatâs what makes food special and meaningful.Mishraâs signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve "},{"hash":"4f18229de2a5d8016e8888758de34cc858e98af2b542ed3077fa8ab2d1e49a3b","title":"patience-passion-and-pastries","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/recipes/2024/04/27/patience-passion-and-pastries","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/BakeleusbyCeleus-1714186343.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1714176000000,"source":"kp","category":"recipes","content":"Celeus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki MandirâJanaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earthâthe Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10Â°c to 20Â°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the worldâs third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the schoolâto quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. Itâs the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leaderâs birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidimâs lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldnât help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughterâsymbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution.

During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. âBaraâ means big, and âImambaraâ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal eraâs artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldnât help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawabâs vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosqueâs serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hallâknown as Asafi HallâI was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. Whatâs even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambaraâthe labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the mazeâs design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, âNow, you understand why they say that walls have ears.âExiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monumentâs historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didnât surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasnât just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phoneâs flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the wellâs water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the waterâs surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the wellâs design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture beforeâit is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time.

Itâs a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If youâre anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a âcan-doâ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. âWe never force the people to push through if we think theyâve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,â says Syangden. According to Syangden, when youâre guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So itâs important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. âWe always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when theyâre unwell isnât our approach,â says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, itâs advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. âI carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,â says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekkerâs return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.âIn my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,â Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelorâs programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. âAll books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,â Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. âI donât know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.âTranslating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepalâs book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the whoâs who of the world literature. Such endeavours havenât just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. âThese translations are poor,â Baral says. âTomes with 1200â1300 pages have been trimmed to 200â300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.âAnother popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.âWe have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,â Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The bookâs Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: âAchyut Koirala, who has a masterâs in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.âKoirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasnât just translated the book but has also done âcreative writingâ with it.âRich Dad Poor Dadâ, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books thatâs perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the bookâall unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, âAt this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.âBasanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. âBut how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!â Thapa wonders. âReaders who havenât read the original wouldnât know the faults in the translated versions.â Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ârecreateâ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslimaâs books are the major victimsTaslimaâs memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as âSangharshaâ, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the bookâs sequel as âPrem ra Jeevanâ. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslimaâs permission. âAbout a decade back, we didnât know how to ask for permission,â he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody elseâs work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslimaâs anthology of essays No Country for Women as âAaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhainaâ. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. âI have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,â Pradhan, who is also a childrenâs book writer, says. âI just copy-edited it upon request.âBishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. âWe translated the book long ago,â he says. âWe are still trying to get translation rights.âIndigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrarâs Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. âAfter I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,â Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Kheraâs You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the bookâs unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they donât even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that itâd be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the authorâs permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldnât demand much for translation rights given Nepalâs small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. âPublishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,â he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harariâs bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the bookâs translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguruâs Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. âThis phenomenon not just hampers Nepalâs fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the countryâs reputation in the global market,â Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. âWe donât have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,â he says. âNobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.â Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.Oneâs pain, anotherâs pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, âThis is a pirated copy and Iâm the author of this book.â The youth wasnât bothered and replied, âOkay, you can buy it at a discount.âThis anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehtaâs friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. âWe sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,â says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepalâs image internationally. âThere was a time when Bangladesh would be known as âpiracy kingâ,â he said. âNow there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.âAs tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.âAfter the governmentâs decision, we stopped importing books for a while,â says Shrestha of Education Books. âThe import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.âPirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesnât levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. âThe government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the countryâs economy as well,â he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House Indiaâs sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. âTo confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,â Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, âKeeping ISBN number at oneâs will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.âBy the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrarâs office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Actâs clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Actâs subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Actâs clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the âimportation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.âIf anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provisionâs implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. âCreation is a crucial part of humanityâs benefit,â he says. âIf intellectual property is not protected effectively, then thereâd be no inspiration to create something.âBal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.âIn the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,â Mukhiya says. âBut in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.â(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) ","summary":"Nepalâs book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. âAll books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,â Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. âI donât know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.âTranslating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepalâs book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the whoâs who of the world literature. Such endeavours havenât just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. âThese translations are poor,â Baral says. âTomes with 1200â1300 pages have been trimmed to 200â300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.âAnother popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.âWe have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,â Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The bookâs Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: âAchyut Koirala, who has a masterâs in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.âKoirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasnât just translated the book but has also done âcreative writingâ with it.âRich Dad Poor Dadâ, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books thatâs perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the bookâall unauthorised.

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum Eastâa close-knit settlement of 425 housesâwas considered the Maoistsâ âbase areaâ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. âYouths started going to America about six-seven years ago,â he said. âIf they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.â Budhaâs own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the USâa country that the Maoists used to call their âenemyâ, an âimperialistic forceâ. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditorsâ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. âAfter the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldnât live in the village peacefully,â said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, âWhen will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!âDhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. âNow we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlalâs trip abroad],â Nanda Kala said. âThereâs no point staying here.âStories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. âItâs not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,â he said. âI aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.âFor six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. âWhen I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,â he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupakâs wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.âI still donât know what exactly happened,â said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupakâs trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, âI only have memories.âLack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, âWorkers of the world, unite!â, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, thereâs nothing he can do. âHow could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?â he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didnât herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. âMeter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,â he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dangâs Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. âOnly those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,â he said.One can infer from Pandeyâs statements that the families of such illegal travellers donât want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesnât include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the âbase areasâ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. âThis is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,â Shrestha said. âThe Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.â Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgencyâs âbase areasâ is due to the political systemâs abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. âThe traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,â he said. âDevelopments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.â(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. ","summary":"Bharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipalityâs ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via âtallo batoââbackdoor routeâand that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum Eastâa close-knit settlement of 425 housesâwas considered the Maoistsâ âbase areaâ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. âYouths started going to America about six-seven years ago,â he said. âIf they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.â Budhaâs own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the USâa country that the Maoists used to call their âenemyâ, an âimperialistic forceâ. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditorsâ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. âAfter the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldnât live in the village peacefully,â said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, âWhen will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!âDhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. âNow we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlalâs trip abroad],â Nanda Kala said. âThereâs no point staying here.âStories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. âItâs not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,â he said. âI aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.âFor six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. âWhen I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,â he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama.

The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldnât have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.âI didnât know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who canât afford hospital stays,â BK said. âBut even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital wonât willingly offer me the service.âThe Pokhara-based 50-bed hospitalâs Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. âWe donât have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,â said Aryal. âMoving forward, we will follow the instructions.â The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. âOur monitoring and inspection is also lax, thatâs why most hospitals ignore the rules,â he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. âOur manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,â he said. âWe need more people for thatâ. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. âThe hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,â said Khadka. âLegal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.â The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directiveâs implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The departmentâs chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. âHospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,â KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the âmedical cityâ  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical collegesâChitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciencesâthat also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.âAlthough the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,â said Chapagain. âOur department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading âDiscounts for the needyâ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.âMeanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. âThere are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. Thatâs why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,â said Adhikari.The monitoring bodiesâ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan Cityâs Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. âWe have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,â he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipalityâs health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. âHowever, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,â Bhattarai said. âWe found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.âThe hospitalâs director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. âBut the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,â he said. âThe metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.âButwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolisâ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the governmentâs health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitanâs health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.âI have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,â he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitanâs Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospitalâs help. âThe hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,â he said. âI had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.âDr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. âPatients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,â she said. âI was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,â said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. âThey do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,â he said. âThe sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.âÂ  ","summary":"Gyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while.

Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitanâs health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.âI have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,â he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitanâs Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospitalâs help. âThe hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,â he said. âI had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.âDr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. âPatients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,â she said. âI was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,â said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. âThey do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,â he said. âThe sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.âÂ  "},{"hash":"531f40a6fe482d0bbbd85f1b1695c45d598ee3905c8b9fa255a3258563b4fe85","title":"**E-Cooking for Sustainability**\n\nE-cooking uses electric stoves or induction cooktops instead of gas or wood.

Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UNâs evolving role in Nepalâs development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Postâs Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepalâs Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepalâs LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteriaâhuman asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)âin the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Developmentâs (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepalâs progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governmentsâ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepalâs market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political partiesâ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepalâs longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call âblended financeâ.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic prioritiesâsustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusionâ ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepalâs evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary Generalâs UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepalâs national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholdersâcivil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-Generalâs visit to Nepal last year exposed the countryâs vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to âstop the madnessâ had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepalâs protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining elementâtransitional justiceâthrough an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepalâs international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to âleave no stone unturnedâ to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepalâs role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepalâs membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the societyâs overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21â22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact peopleâs lives.Â Â  ","summary":"United Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal Hanaa Singer-Hamdy has worked for close to 30 years across development and humanitarian contexts in senior management and strategic leadership roles.

Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepalâs market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political partiesâ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepalâs longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call âblended financeâ.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic prioritiesâsustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusionâ ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepalâs evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary Generalâs UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepalâs national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholdersâcivil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-Generalâs visit to Nepal last year exposed the countryâs vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to âstop the madnessâ had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepalâs protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining elementâtransitional justiceâthrough an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepalâs international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to âleave no stone unturnedâ to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepalâs role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepalâs membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the societyâs overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21â22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact peopleâs lives.Â Â  "},{"hash":"b8cf800b128e5429effac6538b5cdeff14e12e5c92d4968c239f48ce105eb283","title":"interview-with-padam-giri","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/05/05/interview-with-padam-giri","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/padamgiri-1714923097.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1714867200000,"source":"kp","category":"interviews","content":"The budget session of the federal parliament starts Friday without the resolution of the long-standing differences between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate alleged cooperative fraud charges against Rabi Lamichhane, deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs.

The Postâs Binod Ghimire sat down with Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, to discuss the governmentâs plan to make the House productive and its effort to get crucial bills endorsed in the upcoming session. He is also a CPN-UML central committee member. Excerpts:The new session is starting without resolving the old deadlock. How will you ensure its smooth functioning?The Nepali Congress should revisit its demand for the formation of a parliamentary committee targeting a particular person. This is not natural. What are the problems facing the cooperative sector as a whole, which types of fraudulent acts have taken place and who is involved in those cases, however, can be studied. We can constitute a parliamentary committee or other types of panels for such study, which can even recommend actions against those involved in fraud. Why should the main opposition shy away from a detailed study of the entire cooperative sector and want to focus on a particular case and a particular person? I am hopeful the Congress being a responsible democratic party will agree on forming a panel with a broader mandate.The prime minister on Saturday said a probe committee can be formed. What kind of committee is he talking about?He is talking about a committee to study the malpractices prevalent in the cooperative sector, to identify the problems, suggest their solutions while also recommending actions against those involved in fraudulent activities. The main intent behind demanding a probe against a particular person is that once a committee is formed, the party [the Congress] will ask for his resignation. It is an ill-intended demand aimed at creating problems. Media have reported problems in several cooperatives. Would it be feasible to form separate probe committees for each incident? We are in continuous informal discussions with the main opposition and there are plans to discuss the matter formally in an all-party meeting to be held very soon.How will the budget get endorsed if Congress continues to obstruct the House in case the probe panel is not formed as per its demand?Why just probe the home minister and the cooperative where he is allegedly involved? Why not investigate the cooperatives where the leaders from the Congress or any other party might also be involved? We are hopeful that the Congress will analyse whether its demand is rational. I cannot believe it will block budget endorsement.Have you identified why the federal parliament has become so unproductive in terms of bill endorsement?The performance of the parliament is not satisfactory. Getting the bills endorsed as quickly as possible has been my priority ever since taking charge of the ministry. Three bills have been endorsed after I became the minister just two months back. Before that, only one bill had gotten through the parliament in more than one year since the present House of Representatives came into being. That was a matter of shame. Despite the UML then being the opposition party, we had raised the issue in the parliament. It is the governmentâs responsibility to facilitate the deliberations over the bill and their endorsement. As a law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister, it is my major responsibility to make sure the House sessions are fruitful. I am working accordingly.There are 24 bills under consideration in the federal parliament including 23 under the lower house. I am taking initiatives to get them endorsed in the forthcoming session. The amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TJ) Act, school education bill, bill to amend some Nepal Acts, amendment bill to the Banking Office and Punishment Act, among others, are our top priorities.In January your ministry had identified 109 bills that needed to be presented and endorsed. But only two of them have been registered in the parliament. Why?Our ministry has already consented to different ministries to draft 23 bills. The ministry itself is working on eight more. Several of those bills will be registered in the upcoming session.There are complaints that the bill drafting process is not consultative, which is why many of them are controversial. What is obstructing such broad discussions?I agree that the bills drafted after broad discussions are less contentious. The respective ministries should ensure maximum engagement in the drafting process. If the current bills are drafted without proper consultation, there is room to accommodate diverse voices while they are discussed in the House committees. It wonât be possible to take discussions over all the bills to the public. However, some bills that are closely tied to public concerns need to be discussed at the provincial level or even at the local level, if possible. I also have realised the necessity of broader consultation and commit to it in the days to come.Letâs come to an amendment bill on the Transitional Justice Act. What is stopping the bill from being finalised?The Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the parliament has resolved most contentious issues after long discussions. We are close to finding meeting points on some disputed issues. We continue to engage in formal and informal discussions among the parties, with a plan to endorse it from the upcoming session. The Congress, when in government, didnât have any differences over the bill. Rather our party had some concerns, which we are trying to sort out.I donât think it suits the Congress to change its position after being sent to the opposition. People are closely following the position of the different parties on the bill.Listing murder as a serious violation and reduced sentencing are visibly the most contentious issues on the bill. What is the meeting point on these issues?Our partyâs [the UMLâs] position is clear. All killings of the disarmed people other than in the clashes are serious violations of human rights. All the parties have a common view over reduced sentencing but there are differences over its modality.We must be mindful that our transitional justice process delivers justice to the victims. The process cannot move ahead amid reservations from the victims. It is meaningless to push ahead with a process that is not acceptable to concerned stakeholders including the international community.The discussions among the parties are largely focused on these issues. From next week, the House committee will resume deliberations.A committee to recommend the names of the office bearers in two transitional justice commissions has been formed amid reservations from different quarters. Will it still recommend the names or wait until the bill is endorsed?Let us not forget that the committee was formed in line with a time-bound Supreme Court verdict. How can we ignore the courtâs order? A bill doesnât get endorsed in the governmentâs interest. It is a prerogative of the sovereign parliament. Demanding a halt to the formation of the recommendation committee when the court has already given its verdict is not a responsible act.I have come to know that the National Human Rights Commission hasnât sent its representative to the committee, which is wrong. Being a responsible constitutional body it canât baulk at implementing the court's order. It should send its representative. If there are concerns, s/he can present them before the committee.The committee has inducted two retired judges as its members which was the demands of the victims and the other stakeholders. Similarly, there has been an agreement that two members of the five-member commissions will be retired judges. We have tried to abide by the victimsâ concerns as much as we can. When will the Supreme Court get justices in vacant positions?Three positions are already vacant and the fourth will be vacant in a matter of a month or so. Justices for all four positions will be selected in a week or two.Voices are growing mainly from the Congress to amend the constitution to revisit the electoral system. What is your opinion?There has been no discussion on changing the electoral modality. Yes, there is a growing concern that we should find a way to ensure greater stability. We need to discuss how.Is there any possibility of the UML and Congress coming together to form a government?This is now a closed chapter. The two parties had tried to find out possibilities for a tie-up when the present coalition was not even formed. Now there are no such discussions, formally or informally.

At least 110 houses were gutted in Mahottari last week as fast-spreading fires engulfed an entire settlement. Just before that, several settlements were destroyed in Gulmi, Rupandehi and Arghakhanchi. The Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Anil Pokhrel, chief executive of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, for insights on why fire incidents this year have become so common and alarming.Fire incidents have been rising, causing huge losses in various parts of the country. What is the latest update?Weâve experienced an unprecedented number of fire incidents across Nepal. Around two months ago, we had made projections that something like this could happen. We hosted a national dialogue on disaster with experts from the department of hydrology and meteorology, scientists, foresters and representatives from forest users groups. The experts said this yearâs outlook doesnât look good from the perspectives of fire incidents, mainly because we didnât get sufficient rainfall this winter. We received only one fifth or 20 percent of average. So, we had sensed the alarming situation. Along with that, we also witnessed soaring temperatures. Average temperatures have risen in hill areas as well. At the emergency meeting on Friday, we briefed top authorities about the likely scenarios due to soaring temperatures and low rainfall. This time, we also witnessed heavy winds that helped spread the fire.Are there other factors too that have made fires this year so disastrous?Inadequate rainfall, increased temperatures and wind gusts are immediate factors. There are two other factors: No fire incidents of this intensity in the past two years and only 1,528 incidents in 2022 and 3,194 in 2023. In 2021, at least 6,537 fire incidents took place, whereas there were only 1,211 incidents in 2020. When you have below average forest fire incidents in the preceding years, there is an accumulation of forest litter. While the litter piled up on the forest floor this time, there was not enough rainfall to dampen it. Rising temperatures and wind gusts added fuel, helping fires spread faster. Thus, the wildfires became more disastrous this time. Nine people have already lost their lives since Nepali New Year (April 13). The death toll of the two weeks is concerning. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane convened an emergency meeting on Friday where secretaries of the ministries concerned and security chiefs, among other senior officials, joined the discussions. We presented this scenario there and drew their attention to the fact that we still have another two months of dry season until the pre-monsoon rainfall. The next two months are going to be challenging. Besides that, there is an increasing trend of stubble burning mainly because youths arenât available in villages to work in the fields. Due to acute shortage of labour and high cost of clearing fields, people are resorting to burning stubbles, weeds and other remains. There is a perception among the farmers that the ashes work as manure. So, we need massive awareness and training to tackle the situation. People need to be educated about the wider effects of such acts in society. We have also seen unprecedented levels of damage to houses and settlements. When large swathes of forests are burnt, a long-developed ecosystem is destroyed. There are also indirect impacts on human health. In 2019, an estimated 42,100 deaths were attributed to air pollution in Nepal. Besides, the movement of bad quality air from our southern neighbour India is also causing problems. So, this is also a regional problem. You said the ministry convened several meetings in and outside Kathmandu, held discussions among stakeholders and authorities concerned were also alerted. But why have our agencies failed to stop and contain fire incidents?Yes, we have convened a series of dialogues on fire incidents. We also organised events for specific municipalities. The most recent one was in Madhesh Province, where chief district officers of all eight districts in the province, among other officials, were invited. Home minister chaired the meeting. We are taking such initiatives to expedite preparatory measures.In fact, our forest coverage increased drastically in the past three decades. Globally, Nepal is taken as a success story in growing forests. This is positive but it also increases the risk of fires. We donât have adequate human resources, training and equipment to protect these forests from fire. Also, the increasing trend of youths leaving the country and people migrating from the villages has exacerbated the situation. Women and the elderly who are left behind are more vulnerable to fire incidents. Homesteads of deserted houses are covered by bushes. We also find totally empty settlements. There is no gap between forests and settlements. These factors are causing disastrous fires.What is the government doing to tackle the problem in view of this changed context?We have introduced some new technologies based on our ground reality. Usually, we find people in our context go to the fire incident sites without any equipment and gear. There is also a lack of trained people across the country. So, we are focusing on training members of community forest groups. We now prioritise certain areas identified as hotspots. We are giving three types of training. We are training local volunteers who are working with palikas [local units] and other agencies at the local levels. We give orientation on how to put out fires in grasslands and bushes and how to do it when it spreads as crown fire. When trees start to burn people shouldnât go there. Only fire brigades are useful in such cases. But fire trucks canât go to difficult terrains. So, we have introduced portable fire pumps. We learned this from Japanâs national disaster management authority. These pumps are handheld. People can carry them on their own and use them in difficult terrains as well.Can they effectively put out big fires?They are quite effective. For that, you need a pond, a well or other source of water. Since last year, we have already used these water pumps in over 120 places and found them quite effective in dousing fires. At Fridayâs meeting we decided to invest more in such pumps. I suggested every ward of local units need to have at least one such portable fire pump. They canât replace fire trucks but are quite useful for us given our geographical features and even for narrow streets of a city like Kathmandu. You need Rs10 million to buy a fire truck, whereas around 20 portable pumps can be bought for the same amount. The cost ranges from Rs300,000 to around Rs1 million. So each ward can easily afford it. They can pump water from a distant pond or river in hill areas and it can be carried along with water tanks in narrow streets in towns. Maintaining a fire truck and fire brigade is difficult as we need drivers, firemen and their assistants. So, palikas may not be able to afford that. Therefore, we are planning to promote portable fire pumps.In addition, we are designing a training curriculum mainly targeting three sections of peopleâvolunteers of community forest users groups, security agencies including the forest guards and the disaster responders and district level officials who should understand its nuances. We are also running campaigns through various types of awareness materials. In the meantime, we have added search and rescue equipment mainly for security agencies and other personnel deployed in the tasks. Likewise, we have started adopting advanced systems such as helicopters to put out forest fires. First time, we doused forest fires from helicopters through the âbambi bucket operationsâ in Pathibhara of Taplejung and then in Shivapuri and Tanahu as well.Are palikas and other local agencies effective in tackling these cases?We have found local community forest groups quite active in tackling fire incidents. They may not be able to handle big fires. So they coordinate and work with security agencies. Our legal system has given palikas the lead in such cases. So, our role is to equip the local governments. We handed over 100 portable fire pumps to them while around 14 have been sent to district emergency operation centres. Our focus is on equipping local governments. Of them, some do really well. Some others have average performance while yet others do really poorly. We need to form a group of volunteers in each local unit, train them and equip them with gears. What about the role of provinces? Are they working effectively in disaster management?Provinces are critical especially for undertaking risk assessments and determining which palikas have higher, moderate and lower levels of risks. They can help enhance the capacity of local governments and in reconstruction as well. Some provincial authorities are working as per that spirit, such as in Koshi and Bagmati. Karnali has introduced a new concept of insurance for humans as well as property loss.In recent years, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of big business complexes in Kathmandu and other cities. But they donât seem prepared to tackle fire incidents or other disasters. How do you see this trend?This is a serious issue. We discussed this matter in Fridayâs emergency meeting as well. We need to devise a system to assess risk in such buildings. These buildings need to be inspected and checked for whether there is a fire fighting system in place, adequate exits and evacuation systems. We will work on these issues with local governments as it falls under their jurisdiction. ","summary":"People lost their loved ones and incurred huge losses in fire incidents in various districts in the past weeks. At least 110 houses were gutted in Mahottari last week as fast-spreading fires engulfed an entire settlement. Just before that, several settlements were destroyed in Gulmi, Rupandehi and Arghakhanchi. The Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Anil Pokhrel, chief executive of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, for insights on why fire incidents this year have become so common and alarming.Fire incidents have been rising, causing huge losses in various parts of the country. What is the latest update?Weâve experienced an unprecedented number of fire incidents across Nepal. Around two months ago, we had made projections that something like this could happen. We hosted a national dialogue on disaster with experts from the department of hydrology and meteorology, scientists, foresters and representatives from forest users groups. The experts said this yearâs outlook doesnât look good from the perspectives of fire incidents, mainly because we didnât get sufficient rainfall this winter. We received only one fifth or 20 percent of average. So, we had sensed the alarming situation. Along with that, we also witnessed soaring temperatures. Average temperatures have risen in hill areas as well. At the emergency meeting on Friday, we briefed top authorities about the likely scenarios due to soaring temperatures and low rainfall. This time, we also witnessed heavy winds that helped spread the fire.Are there other factors too that have made fires this year so disastrous?Inadequate rainfall, increased temperatures and wind gusts are immediate factors. There are two other factors: No fire incidents of this intensity in the past two years and only 1,528 incidents in 2022 and 3,194 in 2023. In 2021, at least 6,537 fire incidents took place, whereas there were only 1,211 incidents in 2020. When you have below average forest fire incidents in the preceding years, there is an accumulation of forest litter. While the litter piled up on the forest floor this time, there was not enough rainfall to dampen it. Rising temperatures and wind gusts added fuel, helping fires spread faster. Thus, the wildfires became more disastrous this time. Nine people have already lost their lives since Nepali New Year (April 13). The death toll of the two weeks is concerning. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane convened an emergency meeting on Friday where secretaries of the ministries concerned and security chiefs, among other senior officials, joined the discussions. We presented this scenario there and drew their attention to the fact that we still have another two months of dry season until the pre-monsoon rainfall. The next two months are going to be challenging. Besides that, there is an increasing trend of stubble burning mainly because youths arenât available in villages to work in the fields. Due to acute shortage of labour and high cost of clearing fields, people are resorting to burning stubbles, weeds and other remains. There is a perception among the farmers that the ashes work as manure. So, we need massive awareness and training to tackle the situation. People need to be educated about the wider effects of such acts in society. We have also seen unprecedented levels of damage to houses and settlements. When large swathes of forests are burnt, a long-developed ecosystem is destroyed. There are also indirect impacts on human health. In 2019, an estimated 42,100 deaths were attributed to air pollution in Nepal. Besides, the movement of bad quality air from our southern neighbour India is also causing problems. So, this is also a regional problem. You said the ministry convened several meetings in and outside Kathmandu, held discussions among stakeholders and authorities concerned were also alerted. But why have our agencies failed to stop and contain fire incidents?Yes, we have convened a series of dialogues on fire incidents. We also organised events for specific municipalities. The most recent one was in Madhesh Province, where chief district officers of all eight districts in the province, among other officials, were invited. Home minister chaired the meeting. We are taking such initiatives to expedite preparatory measures.In fact, our forest coverage increased drastically in the past three decades. Globally, Nepal is taken as a success story in growing forests. This is positive but it also increases the risk of fires. We donât have adequate human resources, training and equipment to protect these forests from fire. Also, the increasing trend of youths leaving the country and people migrating from the villages has exacerbated the situation. Women and the elderly who are left behind are more vulnerable to fire incidents. Homesteads of deserted houses are covered by bushes. We also find totally empty settlements. There is no gap between forests and settlements. These factors are causing disastrous fires.What is the government doing to tackle the problem in view of this changed context?We have introduced some new technologies based on our ground reality. Usually, we find people in our context go to the fire incident sites without any equipment and gear. There is also a lack of trained people across the country. So, we are focusing on training members of community forest groups. We now prioritise certain areas identified as hotspots. We are giving three types of training. We are training local volunteers who are working with palikas [local units] and other agencies at the local levels. We give orientation on how to put out fires in grasslands and bushes and how to do it when it spreads as crown fire. When trees start to burn people shouldnât go there. Only fire brigades are useful in such cases. But fire trucks canât go to difficult terrains. So, we have introduced portable fire pumps. We learned this from Japanâs national disaster management authority. These pumps are handheld. People can carry them on their own and use them in difficult terrains as well.Can they effectively put out big fires?They are quite effective. For that, you need a pond, a well or other source of water. Since last year, we have already used these water pumps in over 120 places and found them quite effective in dousing fires. At Fridayâs meeting we decided to invest more in such pumps. I suggested every ward of local units need to have at least one such portable fire pump. They canât replace fire trucks but are quite useful for us given our geographical features and even for narrow streets of a city like Kathmandu. You need Rs10 million to buy a fire truck, whereas around 20 portable pumps can be bought for the same amount. The cost ranges from Rs300,000 to around Rs1 million. So each ward can easily afford it. They can pump water from a distant pond or river in hill areas and it can be carried along with water tanks in narrow streets in towns. Maintaining a fire truck and fire brigade is difficult as we need drivers, firemen and their assistants. So, palikas may not be able to afford that. Therefore, we are planning to promote portable fire pumps.In addition, we are designing a training curriculum mainly targeting three sections of peopleâvolunteers of community forest users groups, security agencies including the forest guards and the disaster responders and district level officials who should understand its nuances. We are also running campaigns through various types of awareness materials. In the meantime, we have added search and rescue equipment mainly for security agencies and other personnel deployed in the tasks. Likewise, we have started adopting advanced systems such as helicopters to put out forest fires. First time, we doused forest fires from helicopters through the âbambi bucket operationsâ in Pathibhara of Taplejung and then in Shivapuri and Tanahu as well.Are palikas and other local agencies effective in tackling these cases?We have found local community forest groups quite active in tackling fire incidents.

At the event, the Nepal government will present the prospects of investing in Nepal to investors and try to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Nepal acknowledges that foreign direct investment plays a major role in its economic development, given the shortage of resources within the country. The Postâs Purushottam Poudel sat down with Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Saturday to discuss the summit and what Nepal aims to gain from it.Nepal hosted two investment summits before this, in 2017 and 2019. Nepal hasnât been able to draw the investments promised in both editions of the summit. What different is Nepal doing this time to attract more investment?We have learned from the two previous investment summits. We have also compared ourselves with our neighbouring countries in terms of attracting investments. Data suggests that while they have attracted around 30 percent of the commitments made in similar summits, Nepal has received more.We have drawn around 35 to 40 percent of the investment pledges, which should be considered good. However, we need more than this. This time, we have learned from our previous experience as to why more investment did not come.This time, we have invited investors or people who are researching possible investment prospects to the summit. We are presenting the success stories of people who have invested in other countries of the world or in Nepal. So that it can inspire people to invest.The government brought an ordinance to amend the laws that were seen as obstacles to foreign investment just a few days ago. The ordinance awaits the Presidentâs approval. Potential investors must have noticed this. What do you say?The government has decided to amend some laws through the ordinance that we consider necessary from previous experience. The amended law has reached the President's Office for verification. By the time this interview goes to press, the ordinance may get certified. This will be strong evidence for national and international investors that Nepal is investment-friendly.On the other hand, there is the matter of sovereign credit ratingâwe have already started work on this. It has not started, but it will be finished soon. Once the rating works get completed it will confirm that we are more open to foreign investment. After this, we will be able to know Nepalâs investment rating without asking anyone.Based on this, foreigners can come to Nepal for investment. All these reasons show we are becoming more investor-friendly. On foreign investment, we are bringing a better policy than in the past. With policies on taxes and investment, we are creating an environment that will make it easier to bring in investments, and for investors to take the benefits back to their country without hassle.There are examples of complications faced by investors to take back dividends. Axiata, the parent company of Nepal's private telecom company Ncell, faced the problem. How will investors be attracted when they cannot take profit home?There is a legal provision for withdrawing the return on investment. We are trying to make it simple and practical by learning from the experience of other countries. No multinational company has suffered losses in Nepal. Everyone is earning profits. Ncell has raked in profit many times its investment in Nepal. Dabur Nepal and Unilever are also making profits. There are other multinational companies that are making profits by investing in Nepal.Similarly, foreign investments in the hospitality sector have also returned profits. These profits earned by the companies are no less than what they earn elsewhere. The problem seems to be that we are not presenting our data properly. We will also use this summit as a platform for investors to share their experiences of successfully investing in Nepal.Many investors appear to be attracted to hydropower. However, India has adopted a policy of not buying power from projects with Chinese investment. This also affects our investment climate. How will the government address this?We have made plans for 10 years and plans for 15 years. We have also studied how much energy we need in the coming years. Our emphasis is on clean energy such as hydropower and solar. Our policy is to sell surplus energy to neighbouring countries. Our main markets are India and Bangladesh. China is also our market, to an extent. We have signed various energy-related agreements with India, Bangladesh and China.Investments are coming into this sector from these countries. Business is also being done. Some infrastructure related to the cross-border transmission line is being built. A 400 KV high voltage transmission line has been built on the India side. Some others will be built soon. The Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur transmission line has been built. Butwal-Sunauli is in progress. Similarly, Lamki-Bareli is also in the pipeline. A long-term agreement has been signed with India to sell 10,000 megawatts of hydropower in 10 years.The agreement signed during Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahalâs visit to India last year is in the implementation phase. An agreement has been reached to sell 40 megawatts of hydropower to Bangladesh through India. Bangladesh has asked us for more electricity. We are coordinating with Bangladesh and India at various levels on this issue.As far as the Indian policy is concerned, we will try to consume our own electricity first. We will try to sell the surplus energy to regional markets.Nepalâs political instability is said to be distracting foreign investors. How do you convince them?There is no truth in this. Change of political leadership does not hinder foreign investment in Nepal. This is a normal practice in a democratic system with regular elections. Sometimes the government veers into the minority. Our mixed electoral system tends to give no single party the majority. As a result, we have a coalition government. And whether or not the government maintains policy consistency is important. We may not always have a stable government, but we have a stable policy.We have adopted consistent policies in the fields of hydropower and cement industries for 10 to 15 years. The minister may be changed due to the change of government, but there is no change in policy. Any change in policy is meant for the convenience of investors.When the government was led by the Congress-Maoist alliance, it was said that big investorsâfrom India's richest man, Gautam Adani to the Tata Groupâwere interested in investing in Nepal. However, with the communist forces in power, they are said to be reluctant.This is just a rumour spread by those who do not want the prosperity of Nepal. It is true that some people close to Indian businessman Gautam Adani came to Nepal, and they showed interest in investing in Nepal. According to my information, Adani has invested in Nepal's cement industry. And even now he is positive about investing in Nepal. His representatives are coming to the investment summit as well. The summit is not a matter related to the views of any party. This is Nepal's investment conference. Just because there is a particular coalition does not mean investment will not come. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was the leader of the government when the summit was announced and he is still leading the government. Such rumours are propaganda peddled by those who want to keep investments away.Again, as far as Gautam Adani is concerned, I am personally in touch with people who work with him at various levels. When I became a minister, I invited Adani to Nepal, and we have interacted with him frequently. He is still looking at different areas of investment. He is especially interested in airport construction and management and the energy sector.Geopolitical factors are also believed to impact investments. Is the government prepared to ensure that geopolitics does not affect investment prospects?There are geopolitical conflicts all over the world. In Nepal, we are not against anyone's legal investment. We have always welcomed foreign investment that comes with good intent. If geopolitics affects investment, the most intense geopolitical competition is between the US and China. But these two countries are also the world's largest trading partners. When talking about India and China, there may be competition between them, but there is also cooperation. We need legitimate investment in priority areas. We want to ensure that the investments coming into our country are not targeted against any country.Letâs invest in Nepal.

Separately, leaders of major political parties have started to blame the mixed electoral system for Nepalâs perpetual instability. The Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal talked to political analyst Tula Narayan Shah to discuss these and other related issues.Nepali politics has entered yet another phase of endless bickering over power after the March 4 change of the ruling coalition. Politicians have resorted to every possible tactic to get leadership in provincial governments. How do you analyse this trend?I am not surprised. It is natural in the kind of parliamentary system that we practise. We adopted the parliamentary model in federal and provincial levels while the one at our local level is similar to the presidential system. Local unit chiefs and deputies are elected directly by the people and they can serve five-year terms. That has ensured stability there. Provincial governments on the other hand are destabilised when there is any change at the centre.Leaders have started blaming the electoral system for hung parliaments and instability. Is the problem in the system or with our leaders?Some senior leaders in major parties now blame the electoral system. Even the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) and the Office of the Auditor General have recommended changes in the electoral model, arguing that the current one had promoted corruption in the country. I am not convinced. Politicians argue that no political party could garner a majority in this system and that led to instability. I rather hold politiciansâ personal ambition and corrupt political culture responsible. General secretary of a major political party recently argued that it will be better for national politics to be driven by two political parties. Nepal conducted eight general elections (in 1959, in 1991, in 1994, in 1999, in 2008, in 2013, in 2017 and in 2022) under a multi-party system. Forget the 1959 polls. Of the three polls held in the 1990s, the Nepali Congress got majority in 1991 and 1999. Also, during those years, two partiesâthe Congress and the CPN-UMLâdominated Nepali politics. Did a single-party majority and dominance of two parties provide stability? Not at all. Rather, personal rivalries of the Congress leaders invited instability. Fast forward to 2017 elections. The UML and the Maoist Centre formed an alliance and jointly fought elections. They later merged to form the Nepal Communist Party, which had a comfortable majority. Again the rivalry of the top leaders within the party caused instability. These instances show that a majority for a single party doesnât necessarily translate into stability.I rather see a conspiracy behind blaming the electoral system. In the 1990s, Nepal adopted the first-past-the-post system to elect all lawmakers. Around 70 percent national seats were controlled by two castesâBrahmin and Chhetri. In 2008, we adopted a mixed electoral system, which was a demand of the 2006 peopleâs movement, the Maoist insurgency and the Madhesh agitation. The proportional representation category significantly increased representation of women, dalits, Madheshi and indigenous communities in the legislature, whereas the representation of the males of Khas-Arya groups, who were historically ruling the country, decreased drastically.Who are those elected the most under the FPTP system?The FPTP electoral system has certain attributes that are more conducive to some groups than others. âHigh-caste malesâ win more elections. Females have less of a chance. But dalits also have less chance even if the candidate is male. Those like contractors, landlords and businesspeople who can freely spend win elections. Likewise, those who are well-connected with the power centres in Kathmandu can influence elections. Chhetris and Thakuris were dominant in Panchayat politics. Brahmins got stronger after the 1990 political change. Also those who have access and visibility in media and other public forums have better chances of being elected under the FPTP.Some leaders who have these capabilities have won elections in different systems. There is one Madheshi leader, who won election in Panchayat, got tickets from Congress and won again in the multiparty system. Later he joined a Madhesh-based party and won. So, high-caste males and those with access to power corridors in Kathmandu want FPTP. Whereas, women, dalits and those from marginalised communities prefer PR.A general perception is that those who are directly elected are competent ones and can deliver whereas those from the PR category are there just for the sake of representation. Do you agree?Leaders didnât pick the candidates properly under the PR category. They picked their loved or loyal ones or sold these seats for hefty monetary returns. Leaders from Madheshi and indigenous communities fought for this system. But the same Madheshi leaders kept the names of their wives, daughters and other family members at the top of the PR list. Thus leaders misused and defamed the electoral system. So, the debate should be focused on correcting the wrong practices, not scrapping the system itself.Provinces replicated all the wrong practices of the centre and did even worse.We adopted the same parliamentary system in provinces. So the same thing happened there. Conversely, local units are different as the system there is different. Therefore, we have to go for directly elected executive heads at the centre as well as provinces. Letâs elect the prime minister and chief ministers directly. That will give us stability. Senior leaders from the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre have proposed changing the electoral system but they havenât proposed direct election of the prime minister and chief ministers. So, the solution is direct election of executive heads, as in Palikas. Scrapping of the PR system wonât help.What if a wrong person gets elected to the post and canât be removed for five years?In a democracy, you have to trust the people. Nepali citizens are the ones who removed monarchy. Canât they unseat a leader elected by their votes? In a direct election, even a person from outside the political parties may emerge. So, politicians are afraid because traditionally they exert control over candidacy and various other things through the parties. Many think of provinces as an unnecessary burden on state coffers. Is that the case?I donât think so. State restructuring was one of the major demands of the Maoist insurgency, Madhesh movement and the 2006 Peopleâs Movement. Why did they ask for it? Because Nepal was a heavily centralised state and it wasnât inclusive. Federalisation of the state, inclusive electoral system and reservation quotas in civil service were the three components of state restructuring.But why did the provinces then fail to deliver and win public trust?The stakeholders spent around a decade deciding what type of provinces should be carved out. Even pro-federalists didnât debate how to make the provinces functional. Those who lobbied in favour of the federal system have now become defensive. Some are silent. The political party [which is led by Upendra Yadav] that fought for the federal system has been leading the government in Madhesh for the past six years. But they havenât given any relief to the common people through the provincial government. People have an impression that the provincial system has added corruption and it is only for the leaders and their cronies, not the common people.Are the leaders really corrupt or do they lack efficiency?Even the Maoist and Madheshi parties that promised to be different to the Congress and the UML couldnât come up with a roadmap to make the federal system and state agencies more meaningful for the people. They only indulged in power politics, just like other parties. That frustrated the people.You recently travelled to various parts of Madhesh province. How are the sub-national administrations working and what is the public mood there?A society where people are aware, educated and active helps make leaders as well as administration accountable. Authorities are found to be working arbitrarily in the places where people canât question their wrongdoing. We find relatively better administration in the mid-hill regions, where Brahmins and Chhetris have dominant presence as they have better understanding of the system, laws and other information. Such a mid-hill area expands from the eastern border to Lumbini Province. In this belt, people can raise questions and make the administration accountable. Womenâs status is better while caste-based discrimination is less. Local units, schools, health posts, and administrative units work well. Conversely, these aspects are weak in Karnali, Sudurpaschim, inner Madhesh and in the northern belt as there is no critical mass capable of questioning the authorities.You should understand that there are two Madhesh belts. One is along the East-West Highway, second is the bordering area. The belt along the highway has a diverse social composition. There is dominance of the people who migrated from the hills. Development indicators are better and so is the presence of state agencies. The more you move south, the more you find homogenous populations of Madheshi origin. Traditional power relations havenât changed there. Patron-client dynamics still stand. Certain individuals have key roles in elections and other important activities. They take the decision on behalf of other common people. We find similar practice in the northern belt as well but not in the mid-hill and highway areas.Many say local units perform better than provinces. What is the perception on the ground?Local level is equipped with needed authority. Provinces should be given powers to make them effective as per the spirit of federalism. The present system was designed by reluctant federalists. Therefore, what we need is a fresh debate on the reforms of provinces. There are two conflicting claims. A section of the society says provinces have misused their authority and failed to deliver. Others say the provinces need more authority for effective functioning.It is true that provinces have failed to use the authority they have. Provinces have their legislatures that prepare their budgets and their governments can implement it. Give me an example of an exemplary and innovative initiative taken by any of the seven provinces in the past six years. Madhesh Province started the âBeti Padhau Beti Bachauâ campaign but corruption doomed it. People started raising questions, âwhy do we need provinces, if the leaders there are to copy the same corrupt activities of the centre?âMadheshi leaders opposed the hill peopleâs dominance and discriminatory practices in the central administration. But the same Madheshi leaders arenât promoting an inclusive system in Madhesh. Around 20 percent of the total Madhesh population are dalits. The government in the province has changed multiple times. But how many dalits have been ministers in the provincial Cabinets? There are 136 local units in Madhesh Province. But only one mayor and two deputy-mayors are from the dalit community. Just like a set of elite people has captured Kathmanduâs politics, another set of elites has captured the politics of Janakpur.How do Madheshi people look at provinces?People in Kathmandu, mid-hills, and some other places can be heard saying provinces should be scrapped. Common people in Madhesh donât say so. But they have dissatisfaction with the parties who championed the federal system. They say, âour lives are the same even in the federal systemâ.How do you analyse the performance of two new parties in MadheshâJanamat Party and Nagarik Unmukti?Overall, three parties emerged from the 2022 elections. The Rastriya Swatantra Party emerged from the areas with a dominant presence of hill people. The Janamat Party won from eastern Tarai and the Nagarik Unmukti Party from the western part of the southern belt. The Janamat says the agenda of discrimination against Madhesh is still relevant but they oppose the leadership of the Janata Samajbadi Party and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. The old Madheshi parties spoke against Kathmanduâs discrimination but they themselves didnât work to remove discrimination when they led the government in Madhesh. Besides, they didnât speak against bad governance. Now, the Janamatâs agenda is to fight discrimination and bad governance, both by Kathmandu as well as the old Madheshi parties.The RSPâs emergence is against âthe bad governance of the Congress and the UMLâ. Its major agenda is good governance. It doesnât care about discrimination. But bad governance isnât an agenda of Nagarik Unmukti. The party that emerged mainly after the Tikapur incident is against the discrimination of Tharu community. The dispute in the party is family-based and the outfit hasnât taken the form of a political party. ","summary":"Political partiesâ unhealthy activities to form provincial governments has taken the form of an ugly competition and increased the publicâs frustration with the provinces. Separately, leaders of major political parties have started to blame the mixed electoral system for Nepalâs perpetual instability. The Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal talked to political analyst Tula Narayan Shah to discuss these and other related issues.Nepali politics has entered yet another phase of endless bickering over power after the March 4 change of the ruling coalition. Politicians have resorted to every possible tactic to get leadership in provincial governments. How do you analyse this trend?I am not surprised. It is natural in the kind of parliamentary system that we practise. We adopted the parliamentary model in federal and provincial levels while the one at our local level is similar to the presidential system. Local unit chiefs and deputies are elected directly by the people and they can serve five-year terms. That has ensured stability there. Provincial governments on the other hand are destabilised when there is any change at the centre.Leaders have started blaming the electoral system for hung parliaments and instability. Is the problem in the system or with our leaders?Some senior leaders in major parties now blame the electoral system. Even the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) and the Office of the Auditor General have recommended changes in the electoral model, arguing that the current one had promoted corruption in the country. I am not convinced. Politicians argue that no political party could garner a majority in this system and that led to instability. I rather hold politiciansâ personal ambition and corrupt political culture responsible. General secretary of a major political party recently argued that it will be better for national politics to be driven by two political parties. Nepal conducted eight general elections (in 1959, in 1991, in 1994, in 1999, in 2008, in 2013, in 2017 and in 2022) under a multi-party system. Forget the 1959 polls. Of the three polls held in the 1990s, the Nepali Congress got majority in 1991 and 1999. Also, during those years, two partiesâthe Congress and the CPN-UMLâdominated Nepali politics. Did a single-party majority and dominance of two parties provide stability? Not at all. Rather, personal rivalries of the Congress leaders invited instability. Fast forward to 2017 elections. The UML and the Maoist Centre formed an alliance and jointly fought elections. They later merged to form the Nepal Communist Party, which had a comfortable majority. Again the rivalry of the top leaders within the party caused instability. These instances show that a majority for a single party doesnât necessarily translate into stability.I rather see a conspiracy behind blaming the electoral system. In the 1990s, Nepal adopted the first-past-the-post system to elect all lawmakers. Around 70 percent national seats were controlled by two castesâBrahmin and Chhetri. In 2008, we adopted a mixed electoral system, which was a demand of the 2006 peopleâs movement, the Maoist insurgency and the Madhesh agitation. The proportional representation category significantly increased representation of women, dalits, Madheshi and indigenous communities in the legislature, whereas the representation of the males of Khas-Arya groups, who were historically ruling the country, decreased drastically.Who are those elected the most under the FPTP system?The FPTP electoral system has certain attributes that are more conducive to some groups than others. âHigh-caste malesâ win more elections. Females have less of a chance. But dalits also have less chance even if the candidate is male. Those like contractors, landlords and businesspeople who can freely spend win elections. Likewise, those who are well-connected with the power centres in Kathmandu can influence elections. Chhetris and Thakuris were dominant in Panchayat politics. Brahmins got stronger after the 1990 political change. Also those who have access and visibility in media and other public forums have better chances of being elected under the FPTP.Some leaders who have these capabilities have won elections in different systems. There is one Madheshi leader, who won election in Panchayat, got tickets from Congress and won again in the multiparty system. Later he joined a Madhesh-based party and won. So, high-caste males and those with access to power corridors in Kathmandu want FPTP. Whereas, women, dalits and those from marginalised communities prefer PR.A general perception is that those who are directly elected are competent ones and can deliver whereas those from the PR category are there just for the sake of representation. Do you agree?Leaders didnât pick the candidates properly under the PR category. They picked their loved or loyal ones or sold these seats for hefty monetary returns. Leaders from Madheshi and indigenous communities fought for this system. But the same Madheshi leaders kept the names of their wives, daughters and other family members at the top of the PR list. Thus leaders misused and defamed the electoral system. So, the debate should be focused on correcting the wrong practices, not scrapping the system itself.Provinces replicated all the wrong practices of the centre and did even worse.We adopted the same parliamentary system in provinces. So the same thing happened there. Conversely, local units are different as the system there is different. Therefore, we have to go for directly elected executive heads at the centre as well as provinces. Letâs elect the prime minister and chief ministers directly. That will give us stability. Senior leaders from the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre have proposed changing the electoral system but they havenât proposed direct election of the prime minister and chief ministers. So, the solution is direct election of executive heads, as in Palikas. Scrapping of the PR system wonât help.What if a wrong person gets elected to the post and canât be removed for five years?In a democracy, you have to trust the people. Nepali citizens are the ones who removed monarchy. Canât they unseat a leader elected by their votes? In a direct election, even a person from outside the political parties may emerge. So, politicians are afraid because traditionally they exert control over candidacy and various other things through the parties. Many think of provinces as an unnecessary burden on state coffers. Is that the case?I donât think so. State restructuring was one of the major demands of the Maoist insurgency, Madhesh movement and the 2006 Peopleâs Movement. Why did they ask for it? Because Nepal was a heavily centralised state and it wasnât inclusive. Federalisation of the state, inclusive electoral system and reservation quotas in civil service were the three components of state restructuring.But why did the provinces then fail to deliver and win public trust?The stakeholders spent around a decade deciding what type of provinces should be carved out.

Japan desperately needs foreign workers due to the shortage of a domestic labour force. Therefore, it is in the interest of both countries to make sure that Nepali people who passed the examination for SSW can find a job smoothly and travel to Japan without excessive financial burden. However, in a recent article, there seem to be some crucial misunderstandings and confusions about the Memorandum of Cooperation Japan and Nepal concluded in 2019, which we fear may complicate the smooth implementation of our agreement (âThird party involvement in Japan job programme contradicts agreementâ, December 21, 2020). The embassy would like to clarify the following.The article mentions, âThe agreement says that recruitment is to be carried out under a government-to-government (G2G) modalityâ. This is not true. The Memorandum does not provide any government-to-government procedure for sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal. The contract of employment will be signed by the Nepali workers and their employers in Japan. The Government of Japan doesnât interfere in the private labour market. On the other hand, the Government of Nepal wants to put the implementation of the employment process under its control by issuing permission to Nepali workers wishing to work in Japan. It rather should be called âgovernment-to-business modality (G2B)â. Maybe this misunderstanding derives from the fact that Nepal has concluded migrant worker agreements with other countries only under the G2G modality and has not used the G2B modality.Since last October, 207 Nepalis passed the Japanese language test for care workers and 234 Nepalis passed the technical test for care workers. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to find a job so far. It is desirable they make their own effort to find a job in the Japanese labour market. The article further mentions, âboth countries had strictly ruled out the role of any third party agencies while hiring and supplying workers to Japanâ. This is also untrue. The MOC does not have any paragraph stating to exclude the operation of private recruiting agencies. Paragraph 4 of the Memorandum states that Japan and Nepal can consult on issues related to corrective measures for improper accepting organisations in Japan, or organisations engaging in support for foreign human resources with the status of residence of specified skilled workers, and for the improper activities of the concerned organisations in Nepal. Therefore, the participation of private organisations in the process of sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal is not prohibited. The intermediary agencies to provide Nepali workers with jobs should be registered in Japan in accordance with Japanese laws.The article referred to the possibility that Nepali workers who wish to work in Japan may have to pay for airfare, insurance and medical examination. Since Japan is a free economy country, the Government of Japan canât enforce Japanese companies to pay these costs for Nepali workers. In practice, most Japanese companies cover these costs in employment contracts, but it depends on the individual contract.The article further stated that âNepal is the only South Asian country from where Japan would be hiring workers for 14 industrial sectorsâ. Actually, Japan also signed similar agreements with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after Nepal.We hope that this information is helpful for Nepali people to better understand the agreement between the two countries and that those who passed the examination will be able to find a job and go to Japan as soon as possible.The Embassy of Japan in Nepal ","summary":"We understand that many Nepalis look for an opportunity to work in Japan, and their expectations are very high, as Japan opened up its labour market for Nepalis as specified skilled workers (SSW) and a direct flight between Nepal and Japan was opened in 2019.

It rather should be called âgovernment-to-business modality (G2B)â. Maybe this misunderstanding derives from the fact that Nepal has concluded migrant worker agreements with other countries only under the G2G modality and has not used the G2B modality.Since last October, 207 Nepalis passed the Japanese language test for care workers and 234 Nepalis passed the technical test for care workers. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to find a job so far. It is desirable they make their own effort to find a job in the Japanese labour market. The article further mentions, âboth countries had strictly ruled out the role of any third party agencies while hiring and supplying workers to Japanâ. This is also untrue. The MOC does not have any paragraph stating to exclude the operation of private recruiting agencies. Paragraph 4 of the Memorandum states that Japan and Nepal can consult on issues related to corrective measures for improper accepting organisations in Japan, or organisations engaging in support for foreign human resources with the status of residence of specified skilled workers, and for the improper activities of the concerned organisations in Nepal. Therefore, the participation of private organisations in the process of sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal is not prohibited. The intermediary agencies to provide Nepali workers with jobs should be registered in Japan in accordance with Japanese laws.The article referred to the possibility that Nepali workers who wish to work in Japan may have to pay for airfare, insurance and medical examination. Since Japan is a free economy country, the Government of Japan canât enforce Japanese companies to pay these costs for Nepali workers. In practice, most Japanese companies cover these costs in employment contracts, but it depends on the individual contract.The article further stated that âNepal is the only South Asian country from where Japan would be hiring workers for 14 industrial sectorsâ. Actually, Japan also signed similar agreements with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after Nepal.We hope that this information is helpful for Nepali people to better understand the agreement between the two countries and that those who passed the examination will be able to find a job and go to Japan as soon as possible.The Embassy of Japan in Nepal "},{"hash":"4d564e4aa9b147540d5d27c861b9724bce96976aa16a590835a10f4f29687ad6","title":"contributions-to-nepali","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/letters/2020/11/30/contributions-to-nepali","date":1606694400000,"source":"kp","category":"letters","content":"I am very grateful to Deepak Thapa for raising concerns about the fate of Nepali studies in Euro-America, and for his kind words about my own work over the years (âNepali language at SOASâ, November 25).

Here, Iâm not only addressing the horrendous issue of Chhaupadi itself but also speaking of those women and girls who fall prey to this absurd menstrual practice.Ever thought what travelling back in time would feel like? Many in Nepal do not have to imagine, as such old and evil practises continue to occur in the 21st century!Chhaupadi is a flawed tradition connected to the taboo surrounding menstruation that prohibits Hindu menstruators from participating in normal family activities while on their period, as they are considered impure. Although it is said to be practised in the rural part of the country, it does exist in urban areas, too. Going back to its roots, we could perhaps rationalise that women were asked to stay cautious when menstruating because humans were closely surrounded by wildlife. The stench of blood during their period may have made them more vulnerable to attacks from these animals. But even this absurd line of thought doesn't make much sense anymore. The practise was made illegal in 2005, but cases related to it were reported as recent as 2019. News headlines vouched for fatalities on this account. But why are there such trivial punishments for such an offence? Shouldnât the punishments be rethought to strongly discourage Chhaupadi altogether?Moreover, the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The more you look into it, there are bound to be cases that have gone unreported because nothing immediately tragic occurred. This letter is a call for all of us to come together to fight this social plague. While the legal implications of such an offence are ambiguous, let's collectively decide that the societal implications of it will be grave. Let's refuse to accept such atrocities for our mothers, sisters and, above all, ourselves.Gauri Tandon, via email ","summary":"While feminine issues are addressed every now and then, not everything is taken seriously, and the unspoken issues go unnoticed.
