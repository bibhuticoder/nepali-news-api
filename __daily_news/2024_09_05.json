Speaking on Wednesday, the second day of the party’s politburo meeting that began Tuesday, leaders, without directly naming Shah, termed his statements unruly, while emphasising that the UML is a party with a long history. “Ours is the party with historical roots, therefore, we should not be concerned about statements from certain individuals,” leader Devi Gyawali told the Post, quoting politburo members. On Sunday Mayor Shah, known for his unconventional working style, once again criticised the prime minister, accusing him of failing to act on repeated calls of the metropolitan city to take action against Rekha Sharma. Sharma, a CPN-UML provincial assembly member in Lumbini, is accused of abusing a child domestic worker for eight years.The back-and-forth between Oli and Shah, a popular rapper, is nothing new. Prior to this, on June 3, Shah had accused Oli of ‘policy corruption’ related to the illegal land swap involving Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in Jhapa. Likewise, Gyawali said that most politburo members who spoke on Wednesday suggested the party contest the upcoming election on its own strength, without partnering with other parties. “For this, the party should strengthen its organisational base,” Gyawali quoted politburo members as saying at the meeting. There is no likelihood of a communist alliance in the upcoming election, the meeting asserted, according to Gyawali.Politburo members also discussed the crisis-ridden credit cooperatives and the ongoing parliamentary investigation led by UML politburo member Surya Thapa.“Our politburo members have expressed full confidence in the parliamentary special probe committee and the report it will submit to Parliament in the near future,” Bishal Bhattarai, a member of the politburo, told the Post. “The UML is committed to holding those responsible for the scam legally accountable.”However, none of the politburo members named names in connection with the cooperatives scam, Bhattarai added.On Monday, Kaski police had interrogated Rastriya Swatantra Party chief Rabi Lamichhane, who is also an immediate past deputy prime minister and home minister. Although the parliamentary special probe committee members claim that his involvement in the cooperatives scam cannot be ruled out, Lamichhane has consistently denied any role in the scam. After hearing from 51 politburo members on Wednesday, party chair Oli delivered his concluding remarks before closing the meeting.In his remarks, Oli said that the UML must address the growing indiscipline and unethical behaviours in the party, according to a politburo member. “One should either focus on politics or on enjoyment, but the two cannot go hand in hand,” the politburo member said, quoting Oli. “Immoral activities will not be tolerated.”During Wednesday’s session, politburo members also gave feedback on the party’s ‘Annual Action Plan For National Power Building’ report, which was presented by the party’s general secretary, Shankar Pokharel, on Tuesday.General Secretary Pokharel had presented an 18-point, 23-page report outlining the organisational work the party needs to undertake to be a decisive national power in the upcoming elections. The party’s annual plan includes renewing party memberships, managing and mobilising sister wings, conducting the party’s convention, expanding organisation, assigning responsibilities to district-level leaders who were defeated in the convention, and defining roles for new party members. As per the politburo member, the general secretary’s annual action plan report also calls for resolving the party’s internal conflicts. On Tuesday, Oli had announced that his party will contest the upcoming elections on its own strength. Oli said that the UML may cooperate with the Nepali Congress in government, but it will contest the upcoming elections on policy grounds.The UML chief said the party’s ‘Mission 84’ strategy aims to secure a single-party majority, and instructed party officials to prepare an annual action plan accordingly. “Even though we are currently partnering with the Congress, the UML will contest the elections independently and emerge as a major national power,” Oli said at the politburo meeting. On Sunday, the central committee meeting of the Nepali Congress, the largest party in Parliament, also considered contesting the next general and provincial elections independently. On Tuesday, UML chair and Prime Minister Oli also briefed members on the alleged attempts by the CPN (Maoist Centre) and its chair, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, to destabilise the government. “Since losing power, Dahal has been working to incite certain groups to create unrest,” a politburo party member quoted Oli as saying. “But we won’t let him succeed.”Oli further said that Dahal’s speech in the House of Representatives meeting on August 27 was intended at causing chaos. While speaking in the House, Dahal had warned that if the government pushed through its agenda on the pretext of majority rule, Nepal might see unrest similar to what happened in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.“It was not the language of a responsible leader,” Oli reportedly said during the politburo meeting.The politburo meeting has passed the ‘Annual Action Plan For National Power Building’ report presented by the general secretary, with suggestions. However, the final decision on it will be taken by the central secretariat, says Rajendra Gautam, the head of the UML publicity department.  ","summary":"Politburo members of the CPN-UML have criticised Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) Mayor Balendra Shah’s recent social media posts against party chair and prime minister KP Sharma Oli, calling them ‘unruly’. Speaking on Wednesday, the second day of the party’s politburo meeting that began Tuesday, leaders, without directly naming Shah, termed his statements unruly, while emphasising that the UML is a party with a long history. “Ours is the party with historical roots, therefore, we should not be concerned about statements from certain individuals,” leader Devi Gyawali told the Post, quoting politburo members. On Sunday Mayor Shah, known for his unconventional working style, once again criticised the prime minister, accusing him of failing to act on repeated calls of the metropolitan city to take action against Rekha Sharma. Sharma, a CPN-UML provincial assembly member in Lumbini, is accused of abusing a child domestic worker for eight years.The back-and-forth between Oli and Shah, a popular rapper, is nothing new. Prior to this, on June 3, Shah had accused Oli of ‘policy corruption’ related to the illegal land swap involving Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in Jhapa. Likewise, Gyawali said that most politburo members who spoke on Wednesday suggested the party contest the upcoming election on its own strength, without partnering with other parties. “For this, the party should strengthen its organisational base,” Gyawali quoted politburo members as saying at the meeting. There is no likelihood of a communist alliance in the upcoming election, the meeting asserted, according to Gyawali.Politburo members also discussed the crisis-ridden credit cooperatives and the ongoing parliamentary investigation led by UML politburo member Surya Thapa.“Our politburo members have expressed full confidence in the parliamentary special probe committee and the report it will submit to Parliament in the near future,” Bishal Bhattarai, a member of the politburo, told the Post. “The UML is committed to holding those responsible for the scam legally accountable.”However, none of the politburo members named names in connection with the cooperatives scam, Bhattarai added.On Monday, Kaski police had interrogated Rastriya Swatantra Party chief Rabi Lamichhane, who is also an immediate past deputy prime minister and home minister.

What started as a few friendly messages on social media quickly took a dark turn when the man demanded nude photos of her, which she refused to send.Unfazed, he started sending her unsolicited explicit images of himself. He then began tracking her online activity, leaving threatening messages, and eventually, he found her home address. “I would receive messages saying he was watching me, that he knew where my son went to school,” Maya told the Post. Despite blocking him multiple times, the stalker always found a way to reappear, using different accounts to harass her. Fearing for her nine-year-old son’s safety, she finally mustered the courage to file a complaint with the Cyber Bureau of Nepal Police 15 days ago.Since informing the stalker that she had taken legal action, he has not contacted her again, but the experience has left her feeling paranoid and anxious. She now fears leaving her home and hesitates to go online. “I just want to feel safe again, but I’m not sure if that’s possible anymore,” Maya says.Maya’s ordeal speaks volumes about how violence against women is no longer confined to physical spaces but has increasingly infiltrated the digital world in the form of online abuse, from revenge porn and bullying to sexual harassment, trolling, fraud, and blackmail.The severity of this issue becomes even clearer with data from the Cyber Bureau. In just under two months of the fiscal year 2024-25, the bureau has already recorded 882 cases of cybercrimes involving women. Looking back at previous years, the figures paint a troubling picture. In the fiscal year 2022-23, there were 9,013 reported cybercrime cases, with 4,590 filed by women. The period also saw 130 cases involving minor girls. The following year, 2023-24, witnessed a dramatic rise in the number of cases involving women to 8,745 and those involving minors to 382. This represents an increase of approximately 90.52 percent in cyber violence cases reported by women from 2022-23 to 2023-24.As the country entered a new fiscal year, the trend of online violence continues, with the bureau already reporting 35 cases involving minor girls and 882 cases involving adult women. However, these numbers alone do not capture the full extent of women’s and girls’ vulnerability in the digital space. Traditional beliefs, discrimination, and the normalisation of such behaviour, along with the fear that exposing abuse will shame them and their families, often lead to many cases going unreported.Rita, a 27-year-old woman, from Sunsari whom the Post is identifying with a pseudonym, is one such victim. She never imagined that a relationship she once cherished would end up destroying her life. After a difficult breakup, her ex-partner with whom she had a live-in relationship, sought revenge by sharing intimate videos and photos of her online with her family, friends, and relatives in 2022.For the next six months, her ex continued to sexually harass her through social media. The abuse only ceased after she attempted suicide, which resulted in a three-week hospitalisation.“Even after all this happened, my family refused to help me file a complaint. My relatives even mocked me, saying that I had already done intimate things during the live-in relationship. They said he wasn’t physically hurting or abusing me, so I should just get over it”, says Rita.According to a UN report based on studies in 10 countries, an estimated 95 percent of aggressive behaviour, harassment, abusive language, and degrading images online are directed at women, and they often come from partners or ex-partners.A year has passed for Rita, but the emotional scars remain, and she continues to struggle with depression.Many in Nepal, like Rita’s relatives, downplay the impact of online harassment, dismissing it as “just virtual, not physical.” However, a UN report titled ‘Combating Online Violence Against Women & Girls: A Worldwide Wake-Up Call,’ published by the UN Broadband Commission in 2015, tells a different story. It argues that ‘cyber touch’ can be as damaging as physical touch, suggesting that online abuse can be as bad as domestic violence or sexual assault.Now, as women across Nepal are celebrating Teej, many find themselves facing online violence. They are subjected to a barrage of hate speech simply for enjoying themselves.In recent years, the sight of women dancing, singing, drinking, and celebrating during Teej has sparked outrage among certain segments of society, particularly men who see these activities as a challenge to traditional gender roles. Social media trolls have seized on the opportunity to attack and criticise what they consider ‘inappropriate behaviour, clothing, and dance.’“Every year, it’s the same story,” says Ankita Chapagain, a 40-year-old from Kathmandu. “As soon as videos of women enjoying Teej and dancing go online, the hate comments start pouring in. We’re called names, our morals are questioned, and we’re blamed for the supposed degradation of society.”This animosity extends beyond anonymous trolls; it mirrors a deeper social unease with women’s independence and the pervasive misogyny and patriarchy in our culture. “It’s as if they can’t stand to see women happy and celebrating on their own terms,” Chapagain adds.The problem intensifies during elections, with female politicians facing significant online abuse. An analysis conducted by Panos South Asia reveals that insults and hate speech are the most common attacks on female politicians.A joint statement by the United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Violence against Women and Freedom of Expression says online violence against women can “chill and disrupt the online participation of women journalists, activists, human rights defenders, artists, and other public figures and private individuals” —which underscores the severe impact of growing cyber violence.So, how well-prepared are the institutions responsible for addressing this issue, like the Cyber Bureau? The answer seems to be, not very well.Superintendent of Police Deepak Raj Awasthi, spokesperson, and information officer of the Cyber Bureau, told the Post last month that the bureau is struggling with both understaffing and underfunding.The gap between the rise in cybercrimes and the lack of resources leaves the virtual realm a dangerous space, especially for girls and women who are already vulnerable due to unsafe physical environments, pervasive misogyny, and systemic discrimination.

He then pledged to raise the coverage of the government’s health insurance scheme to Rs500,000 soon.But neither have the long waiting lines at the state-run health facilities ended, nor have serious discussions been held yet to increase government health insurance coverage.And now, the Ministry of Health and Population has issued a circular to all agencies concerned to implement the cabinet decision of running outpatient care on public holidays.Multiple experts the Post talked to, including doctors, retired bureaucrats, and representatives of the Nepal Medical Association, said that it is easier said than done and suggested that Health Minister Paudel should consult with experts before making any decision.“Many state-run hospitals have not even been able to run extended services,” said Dr Senendra Upreti, the former health secretary. “Decisions to end waiting lists at state-run hospitals, increase coverage of the health insurance scheme and run patient care on public holidays sound too good, but one should also know about the challenges of implementing those decisions. Long waiting lists at the hospitals should have ended as of now if it was so easy to do.”Most health ministers visit state-run hospitals upon assuming office and direct officials concerned to end the long waiting lists, commit to increasing human resources, and provide a required budget to ease patients’ suffering.Doctors say people have not expected the repetition of the same commitments from the new minister, from whom they have expected some changes.“Why would one serve on public holidays without any incentive, and how could the government force only health workers to serve on public holidays, not other civil servants?” questioned Mahendra Prasad Shrestha, a retired chief specialist at the Health Ministry. “I didn’t find other countries providing outpatient care on public holidays.”Upreti, who also served as chairman of the Health Insurance Board, said the minister's commitment to increase the coverage of the government’s health insurance scheme to Rs500,000 shortly shows his ignorance about the ground reality. The government pays a premium of over 50 percent of those enrolled in the scheme and has to allocate additional billions of rupees to reimburse the hospitals. Due to the government’s inability to reimburse hospitals on time, many hospitals threaten to stop providing the scheme every year.Public health experts say the government has not increased human resources in state-run hospitals in the last 30 years. Despite that, the number of patients seeking health care has increased manifold, and the capacity and budget of health facilities have not increased accordingly. They said that all staffers are needed to run health facilities on public holidays, and the government has not allocated an additional budget to run health facilities on public holidays.“I have suggested the new health minister to start from small things,” said Shrestha. “He might have thought that ending long waiting lists in state-run hospitals is trivial, but it is not so trivial. I have also asked him to hold staffers of the Health Ministry until office hours first.”Meanwhile, the Nepal Medical Association, the umbrella organisation of medical doctors, has protested against the decision to run outpatient departments on public holidays.Issuing a statement on Tuesday, the association sought the government’s attention to the lack of human resources in the state-run health facilities.“No new post has been created in the last 33 years,” said Dr Anil Bikram Karki, chairman of the association. “Doctors have already been working 72 hours a week despite not being incentivised to work during the Covid-19 pandemic. We have strong reservations against the decision to run outpatient care on public holidays without offering incentives to health workers and increasing the human resources.”Doctors say the long waiting lines in state-run health facilities will end if the government creates additional posts for health workers, including doctors, and makes the referral mechanism systematic.They said patients should not be forced to visit Kathmandu to examine minor health problems. Instead, health workers and services should be made available in the local health facilities, human resources should be increased, and more budget should be allocated.“If we have problems with long waiting lines in hospitals, citizens have to endure long queues while accessing public service,” said Karki. “Doctors never deny emergency services, but one should not mix emergency care with elective care [planned medical care].

He is elated.The arrival of the new large cardamom crop has beat farmers' expectations this year, yet yields have been lower, resulting in early seasonal price spikes.Traders say that the large cardamom market is experiencing a resurgence, driven by increasing international demand and seasonal consumption trends.The price had reached Rs2,150 per kg in January and dropped slightly.On Friday, the price of the spice reached Rs2,100 in Birtamod, the key market in eastern Tarai, where farmers sell their products.The rise in the price has made growers happy as Dashain, the country’s longest festival, approaches. This festival fuels strong domestic demand, and for farmers, the rise in crop prices means a happy celebration due to their income.From there, traders export large cardamom, one of the world's most expensive spices, to Siliguri, India.Nepal is the world's biggest producer of large cardamom, with a 68 percent global market share. The spice is grown in Sikkim, Darjeeling and Bhutan. Large cardamom was introduced in Ilam from Sikkim in 1865.The highest average price of large cardamom in Siliguri, India, on Thursday (August 29) was INR2,254 per kg or Rs2,660 per kg, as quoted at the Spices Board of India auction centre.Thapa, who came to Phungling Bazar, Taplejung, sold large cardamom to Bhadra Bir Regmi, president of the Large Cardamom Traders Association.“The first batch I had purchased was in July, at Rs2,000 per kg,” said Regmi. He said that the price around the festival time was Rs1,375 per kg.Large cardamom grown in Nepal, known as Alaichi, is one of Nepal's largest export crops.The large cardamom is harvested from mid-August to October.In Taplejung, the largest cardamom-producing district, the crop is cultivated in seven rural municipalities and one municipality, except Phaktalung rural municipality-7, Olangchung Gola.The cash crop is a major source of income in the district. Nepali large cardamom—also known as ‘black gold’ or ‘black cardamom’—belongs to the botanical family Zingiberaceae and is one of the most expensive spices in the world. According to a government report, it is an evergreen, perennial, and herbaceous plant grown on north-facing hill slopes.Balmani Baral, president of Large Cardamom Zone, Taplejung, said the traders had purchased the spice by keeping their cut, on top of the transportation cost.“As the demand soars, there’s a buzz in the market. Nowadays, traders offer the same rate in Taplejung that is offered in Birtamod, Jhapa,” he said. The surface travel distance between Taplejung and Jhapa is over 240 kilometres. “The prices, however, keep fluctuating,” Baral said. Large cardamom prices dropped to one of the lowest levels in Birtamode in December 2022, trading at 625 per kg, mainly due to the impact of Covid, when the supply chain was choked globally.In 2014, large cardamom hit an all-time high of Rs2,500 per kg.Since January, the large cardamom entrepreneurs association has projected that the price may breach the 2014 levels this year.Ninety-eight percent of the large cardamom produced in Nepal is exported to India. It is then reexported to Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Bahrain, among other countries.Pakistan is the largest importer of large cardamom, purchasing roughly 60 percent of India’s large cardamom exports. The local Muslim community uses large cardamom pods in biryani, a popular Pakistani dish, as a symbol of prosperity and wealth.As the government has not fixed the price and there is a minimum support price, large cardamom is sold by the farmers at the traders' rate.There is a huge price difference between the production's start and the harvest's end.Nirmal Bhattarai, president of the Large Cardamom Entrepreneurs' Association of Nepal, said they buy large cardamom from farmers at the rate quoted by the traders in Birtamod and after assessing the international market rate.Large cardamom is produced in 42 districts.According to the agriculture ministry's statistics, large cardamom is produced in 12,500 hectares. Koshi Province produces most of the country's large cardamom, as the commodity is harvested in 11,000 hectares in this province.The country produces 6,500 tonnes of large cardamom annually, 2,800 tonnes of which are produced in Taplejung district.Gulf countries have a huge potential market for Nepali cardamom, but there is no direct export to those countries. Traders are unwilling to take risk exporting to those countries, as the Indian market is assured for them.According to the Trade and Export Promotion Centre, cardamom export declined by 4.06 percent to Rs7.94 billion in the last fiscal year ended mid-July. Large cardamom produced in Nepal is organic and provides income to mostly low-income rural families.Large cardamom exports rose 127 percent in the past ten years. ","summary":"At this time of year, large cardamom farmers from the eastern hills and mountains eagerly await the market in the plains to boom for their prized produce.Among many large cardamom growers, Ganesh Thapa of Mikwakhola rural municipality too hauled his spice in Birtamod, Jhapa, around 240 kilometres downhill from Taplejung.On Friday, he sold 120 kg of large cardamom for Rs2,100 per kg, making Rs252,000. He is elated.The arrival of the new large cardamom crop has beat farmers' expectations this year, yet yields have been lower, resulting in early seasonal price spikes.Traders say that the large cardamom market is experiencing a resurgence, driven by increasing international demand and seasonal consumption trends.The price had reached Rs2,150 per kg in January and dropped slightly.On Friday, the price of the spice reached Rs2,100 in Birtamod, the key market in eastern Tarai, where farmers sell their products.The rise in the price has made growers happy as Dashain, the country’s longest festival, approaches. This festival fuels strong domestic demand, and for farmers, the rise in crop prices means a happy celebration due to their income.From there, traders export large cardamom, one of the world's most expensive spices, to Siliguri, India.Nepal is the world's biggest producer of large cardamom, with a 68 percent global market share. The spice is grown in Sikkim, Darjeeling and Bhutan. Large cardamom was introduced in Ilam from Sikkim in 1865.The highest average price of large cardamom in Siliguri, India, on Thursday (August 29) was INR2,254 per kg or Rs2,660 per kg, as quoted at the Spices Board of India auction centre.Thapa, who came to Phungling Bazar, Taplejung, sold large cardamom to Bhadra Bir Regmi, president of the Large Cardamom Traders Association.“The first batch I had purchased was in July, at Rs2,000 per kg,” said Regmi. He said that the price around the festival time was Rs1,375 per kg.Large cardamom grown in Nepal, known as Alaichi, is one of Nepal's largest export crops.The large cardamom is harvested from mid-August to October.In Taplejung, the largest cardamom-producing district, the crop is cultivated in seven rural municipalities and one municipality, except Phaktalung rural municipality-7, Olangchung Gola.The cash crop is a major source of income in the district. Nepali large cardamom—also known as ‘black gold’ or ‘black cardamom’—belongs to the botanical family Zingiberaceae and is one of the most expensive spices in the world. According to a government report, it is an evergreen, perennial, and herbaceous plant grown on north-facing hill slopes.Balmani Baral, president of Large Cardamom Zone, Taplejung, said the traders had purchased the spice by keeping their cut, on top of the transportation cost.“As the demand soars, there’s a buzz in the market.

This system allows individuals, communities, governments, businesses and other groups to take prompt actions to mitigate disaster risks before hazardous events occur.Nepal’s Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) has a centralised approach to sending messages directly through SMS and social media posts to the potential flooding region. However, most early warning communication still depends on volunteer community members who directly face the disasters’ brunt to reach all households, including those without mobile phone access. Since 2006, Nepal’s two biggest telecom providers, Ncell and NTC, have disseminated alerts during impending disasters for floods and expanded them to multi-hazard events in 2024. NGOs have been working to establish upstream and downstream linkages along small river systems with reoccurring floodings, which often receive little attention. Dinesh Rana, Secretary of Kanj Community Disaster Management Committee (CDMC) from Laljhadi Municipality of Kanchanpur district of Sudurpaschim province, explains how the early warning system works: Community gauge readers and task force members circulate the warning messages to the downstream community if the rainfall is high upstream and the river water level reaches near the warning level in Belkundi. Mangal Prasad Chaudhary, an EWS task force member from Tilki, Kanchanpur, calls them if the water level crosses 3 meters in Tilki, and Rana’s team disseminates the message to their community members and prepares to save the property and go towards a safe location.Early warning saves lives only if it leads to action. EWS is a proven cost-effective disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation measure that protects lives, livelihoods and ecosystems during climate-related hazards. Evident from the flood EWS development and strengthening in Kanchanpur, the affected population has significantly reduced, and there are now near zero deaths post-2011, particularly in the communities that did not initially receive early warning information before the flood. Similarly, early warning in the August 2023 Kagbeni flood saved lives despite the extensive infrastructural damages. However, an inadequate understanding of the system and disregard for safety can be detrimental. There have been frequent deaths during floods due to negligence and carelessness of the people, such as diving into floodwaters to collect washed-away logs, treating floods as exotic sightseeing opportunities, or even conducting activities near potential flooding areas despite warnings. A critical link was missing in the Babai River basin (Bardiya district) during the 2014 flood. Even though the gauge reader informed the authorities about the flood, they only grasped the gravity of the situation when it was too late and when more than 100 people had already died. The July 2024 Kanchanpur flood claimed the lives of three girls in Punarbas who went to take a bath, even after receiving the potential flood early warning message. Most accidents occur because the locals do not consider the river's depth before carrying out any activities on the riverbank. This calls for installing flood guideposts in different areas to inform people about the height of land on the riverbed. Lessons from the 2024 floodsAlthough the government mostly invests in hardware infrastructures, focusing on raising awareness and behavioural change is imperative in early warning approaches. A recent 2024 flooding saw the local government sending rubber boats from the Local Emergency Operation Center (LEOC) to flood-impacted communities to evacuate the people. However, the households sent their livestock on the boats for evacuation, fearing theft and loss of property more than their safety. The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology takes responsibility for sending these messages, but the capacity and mechanism to share information about potential risks or impacts are far from enough. Moreover, there are shortcomings in operationalising the common alerting protocol. Coordination is still lacking in translating and reaching communities with the message of the flood and its impact. Connecting community context with those messages is another challenge. This July, Kanchanpur recorded the highest rainfall in 78 years; the DHM rain gauge station at Dodhara Chandani recorded the highest rainfall in Nepal at 624 mm in 24 hours.The flood that followed highlighted variations in rainfall between the Sundarpur synoptic station, Hanuman Dagar station and Dodhara Chadani station, although the aerial distance is within 6-7 km. These are the evidence of the increasing micro-climatic variations in Nepal. This demands that we understand forecasts and their potential impacts better. Along with increasing the density of existing gauge stations for better forecasts, there must also be a focus on promoting localised EWS.Towards early actionWith technological advancements in warning systems already in place, we should not wait to respond after a disaster. We must promote early action to prepare for disasters through better forecasts and identification of early actions. Early action should be ingrained in the mindset of the government and community members, informed by trusted localised forecasts with a longer lead time to plan and respond. It should be supported by a decision support system that anticipates the hazard and its impact and provides a set of pre-identified recommended early actions.We must build trust in the shared early warning messages to ensure actions are taken. Building trust in the disaster EWS, including the increasing and off-seasonal weather events, will attract more attention and investments. Proper utilisation of EWS will be a challenge without accurate localised forecasting capabilities. All tiers of government and existing EWS-responsible institutions must be connected with community-level EWS to strengthen communication channels and response efforts. Greater collaboration is required to incentivise DRR activities, attract private sector engagement and investment and retain trained volunteers within the community to support disaster response.Equally important is raising awareness among the stakeholders, including communities, about the disaster EWS and its scope. This should consider human behaviour and response during disasters, as interest in EWS typically spikes only when rain begins to impact communities. While technological advancements and community reach are commendable, we should regularly review and reflect on EWS's progress. This allows for gap assessments and awareness of challenges actors face within the EWS communication channel and brings them together to enhance EWS governance.

The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the resulting increase in prices of essential commodities like food, fuel and fertilisers have significantly impacted the country’s import-dependent economy. Nepal’s main imports include refined petroleum ($2.24 billion, 16 percent of total imports), followed by petroleum gas ($504 million, 3.75 percent), gold ($433 million, 3.23 percent), rice ($322 million, 2.4 percent), and soybean oil ($306 million, 2.2 percent), with India being the primary source for these goods. The rise in imports coincided with the demand-led recovery following Covid-19. In response, without price mechanisms, the Government of Nepal imposed an import restriction on 10 different categories of luxurious goods on April 26, 2022. Additionally, the authorities directed commercial banks to refrain from issuing letters of credit to Nepali traders seeking to import luxurious goods, i.e., commercial banks must deposit 50 percent to 100 percent of the value of their imports in bank accounts. The central bank’s move came in the wake of mounting concerns related to Sri Lanka’s widening trade deficit, the soaring balance of payment deficit and declining inflows of remittances and foreign exchange reserves. Restrictions and implicationsThe import restrictions initially imposed by the government appeared politically appealing, providing control over foreign exchange reserves and the economy. However, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) does not support these restrictions and suggests alternative policy instruments that are more favourable and effective in addressing economic challenges. Article VIII of the Article of Agreement of the IMF prohibits country members from imposing import bans, cash margins and obligations of letters of credit. These practices give rise to multiple currency practices. They operate as implicit devaluations against the IMF's policies because they create distortion and promote invoicing and smuggling. In 2022, the import restrictions had a noticeable impact on recorded imports, resulting in a slowdown. The IMF analysis suggests that the bans led to a reduction of approximately 22 percent in imports, while mandatory letters of credit and margins resulted in around 11 percent decrease. However, these measures alone cannot address external pressures as a long-term solution. The banned items constituted only a maximum of 5 percent of total imports, while imports affected by mandatory letters of credit and margins accounted for approximately 23 percent. The reduction of roughly $80 million per month in imports was insufficient to address the underlying issues effectively.After the government lifted a seven-month import ban on luxury goods on December 15, 2022, remittance inflow declined by 33 percent and stood at $3.65 billion. The number of Nepali workers seeking foreign employment fell by 7.5 percent to 236,779. Although the foreign reserves increased by 11.5 percent during the ban, rising from $7.76 billion in mid-April 2022 to $8.66 billion in mid-December, the reliance on import restrictions as a long-term solution remains unsustainable. The underlying causes of external pressures, such as high global commodity prices and robust domestic demand, require alternative approaches to ensure economic stability. Economic implicationsImport restrictions in Nepal have significant consequences for the economy. They lead to a decline in government revenue, foster opportunities for rent-seeking behaviour, contribute to inflationary pressures and undermine social trust. The limitations also affect crucial sectors like tourism and hospitality, as the lack of foreign alcohol impacts the hotel and restaurant industry and fuels illicit trade. Some goods are prohibited but do not consume significant amounts of foreign exchange. For instance, the restrictions on vehicle imports, which constitute a relatively small portion of total imports, contribute over one-third of customs duty revenues. Consequently, although overall customs revenue remained relatively strong in FY 2021-22, it fell significantly short of the Department of Customs' target during the first six months of FY 2022-23, experiencing a decline of 51 percent. Had the government taken measures to boost the country’s vehicle (including EV) production, import restriction would make sense as domestic production would positively impact job creation. However, the immediate effect would only be seen when the country starts to manufacture e-vehicles in the country. This requires long-term planning and smooth facilitation from the government to pave the path for private sector development, mainly by investing in high-productivity sectors. Other factors, such as the rebound in tourism and the increase in remittances, also improved foreign reserves. Moreover, the foreign reserve to handle merchandise imports rose from around seven months in April 2022 to 10 months in December 2023. It exceeded the central bank policy floor of seven months of import cover and the IMF's recommendation level of six months. The IMF appears more lenient than the NRB in assessing reserve adequacy. However, the IMF has a well-developed methodology for evaluating reserve adequacy, which is more complex than the NRB. Some of the main weaknesses identified in the external sector statistics were an overestimation of goods imports; an underestimation of travel services exports, an underestimation of remittances, particularly those transmitted through informal channels, incomplete data on trade credit, making it difficult to reconcile flows and stocks; and the potential for inadequate coverage of external debt statistics. Both IMF and NRB estimates suggest that Nepal’s reserves are adequate.Way forwardThe government and NRB implemented temporary fiscal and monetary measures to address the trade imbalance, manage domestic demand and restore foreign reserves. As a result, the trade deficit was reduced, and the current account deficit stood at 1.5 percent of GDP in 2023 from 12.7 percent in 2022. This improvement can be attributed to lower import demand, decreased commodity prices and strong remittance and tourism income. However, the negative consequences and long-term challenges of import restrictions should not be overlooked. Some of these include negative impacts on industries, reduced foreign investment, reduced consumer choices and higher prices for imported goods.

Additionally, the authorities directed commercial banks to refrain from issuing letters of credit to Nepali traders seeking to import luxurious goods, i.e., commercial banks must deposit 50 percent to 100 percent of the value of their imports in bank accounts. The central bank’s move came in the wake of mounting concerns related to Sri Lanka’s widening trade deficit, the soaring balance of payment deficit and declining inflows of remittances and foreign exchange reserves. Restrictions and implicationsThe import restrictions initially imposed by the government appeared politically appealing, providing control over foreign exchange reserves and the economy. However, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) does not support these restrictions and suggests alternative policy instruments that are more favourable and effective in addressing economic challenges. Article VIII of the Article of Agreement of the IMF prohibits country members from imposing import bans, cash margins and obligations of letters of credit. These practices give rise to multiple currency practices. They operate as implicit devaluations against the IMF's policies because they create distortion and promote invoicing and smuggling. In 2022, the import restrictions had a noticeable impact on recorded imports, resulting in a slowdown. The IMF analysis suggests that the bans led to a reduction of approximately 22 percent in imports, while mandatory letters of credit and margins resulted in around 11 percent decrease. However, these measures alone cannot address external pressures as a long-term solution. The banned items constituted only a maximum of 5 percent of total imports, while imports affected by mandatory letters of credit and margins accounted for approximately 23 percent. The reduction of roughly $80 million per month in imports was insufficient to address the underlying issues effectively.After the government lifted a seven-month import ban on luxury goods on December 15, 2022, remittance inflow declined by 33 percent and stood at $3.65 billion. The number of Nepali workers seeking foreign employment fell by 7.5 percent to 236,779. Although the foreign reserves increased by 11.5 percent during the ban, rising from $7.76 billion in mid-April 2022 to $8.66 billion in mid-December, the reliance on import restrictions as a long-term solution remains unsustainable. The underlying causes of external pressures, such as high global commodity prices and robust domestic demand, require alternative approaches to ensure economic stability. Economic implicationsImport restrictions in Nepal have significant consequences for the economy. They lead to a decline in government revenue, foster opportunities for rent-seeking behaviour, contribute to inflationary pressures and undermine social trust. The limitations also affect crucial sectors like tourism and hospitality, as the lack of foreign alcohol impacts the hotel and restaurant industry and fuels illicit trade. Some goods are prohibited but do not consume significant amounts of foreign exchange. For instance, the restrictions on vehicle imports, which constitute a relatively small portion of total imports, contribute over one-third of customs duty revenues. Consequently, although overall customs revenue remained relatively strong in FY 2021-22, it fell significantly short of the Department of Customs' target during the first six months of FY 2022-23, experiencing a decline of 51 percent. Had the government taken measures to boost the country’s vehicle (including EV) production, import restriction would make sense as domestic production would positively impact job creation. However, the immediate effect would only be seen when the country starts to manufacture e-vehicles in the country. This requires long-term planning and smooth facilitation from the government to pave the path for private sector development, mainly by investing in high-productivity sectors. Other factors, such as the rebound in tourism and the increase in remittances, also improved foreign reserves. Moreover, the foreign reserve to handle merchandise imports rose from around seven months in April 2022 to 10 months in December 2023. It exceeded the central bank policy floor of seven months of import cover and the IMF's recommendation level of six months. The IMF appears more lenient than the NRB in assessing reserve adequacy. However, the IMF has a well-developed methodology for evaluating reserve adequacy, which is more complex than the NRB. Some of the main weaknesses identified in the external sector statistics were an overestimation of goods imports; an underestimation of travel services exports, an underestimation of remittances, particularly those transmitted through informal channels, incomplete data on trade credit, making it difficult to reconcile flows and stocks; and the potential for inadequate coverage of external debt statistics. Both IMF and NRB estimates suggest that Nepal’s reserves are adequate.Way forwardThe government and NRB implemented temporary fiscal and monetary measures to address the trade imbalance, manage domestic demand and restore foreign reserves. As a result, the trade deficit was reduced, and the current account deficit stood at 1.5 percent of GDP in 2023 from 12.7 percent in 2022. This improvement can be attributed to lower import demand, decreased commodity prices and strong remittance and tourism income. However, the negative consequences and long-term challenges of import restrictions should not be overlooked. Some of these include negative impacts on industries, reduced foreign investment, reduced consumer choices and higher prices for imported goods.

She was first reported missing on August 2 when police visited her home in Manassas city, where she lived with her husband, Naresh Bhatt and her year-old daughter. What seemed like an act of disappearance seemingly turned into a convoluted case of murder when the husband, a former Fairfax County police recruit and ex-US Army Reserve, was accused of killing her after the detectives searched their home on August 21. Nepalis who knew Mamta and her well-wishers from the community were in shock. If the accusations are true, this would be another sad and shameful case of the killing of a Nepali woman by her partner after being subjected to Intimate Partner Violence (IPV). It forces us to reflect on the hidden problem of violence against women in intimate relationships in Nepal. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), IPV is a common form of violence against women and includes physical, sexual and emotional abuse and controlling behaviours by an intimate partner. The National Demographic Health Survey 2022 revealed that 27 percent of women in Nepal had experienced IPV in their lifetime. Further, the registered cases of domestic violence in Nepal have noticeably increased in the past 28 years.Many Nepali women feel unseen, unheard and powerless in their relationship with men. Moreover, there is a general lack of understanding of consent among Nepali men. During the Covid-19 pandemic, violence between intimate partners increased worldwide. In Nepal, police reported that cases of violence against women steadily rose despite the country being under prohibitory orders. The ingrained patriarchy manifests in various forms in intimate relationships where women suffer and become scarred for life. Marital rape is also widespread, with loopholes in the implementation of related laws.Internalising the lack of safety at home, many Nepali women dream of going abroad and settling there. But, sadly, patriarchy leading to IPV goes beyond borders. This year alone, there have been cases of Nepali women being killed abroad. On August 29, Muna Pandey, a Nepali student, was shot dead in her apartment in Houston, Texas. Police arrested 51-year-old Bobby Singh, who was known to frequent the restaurant where Pandey worked. Earlier this year, Chandra Maya Poudel-Rimal was murdered by her husband, James Rimal, in Ohio during an argument. In the same state, in July, Tika Dhimal was murdered by her husband, Sada Dhimal, who later committed suicide.These instances suggest Nepali women are vulnerable to IPV everywhere. In many cases, women give their partners several chances before speaking up. Even if they decide to seek legal help, they usually settle the matter, facing pressure from family or their partners. A former colleague reportedly knew of Mamta’s domestic violence situation with her husband. When her colleague told Mamta to leave her house and offered help, Mamta decided to give her husband another chance. Although Nepal has made progress through stronger laws against the violation of women’s rights and participation in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, they are still not enough to ensure women’s safety from IPV. There is an urgent need to foster awareness to empower women to seek help and assert their rights. Finally, we must teach our men the basics of consent in relationships. Legal mechanisms can only do so much if we as a society fail to challenge and change our patriarchal mindset.

We have to end this epidemic of gun violence,” Harris said at the start of a campaign event in New Hampshire.Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, wrote on social media that “Our hearts are with the victims and loved ones of those affected by the tragic event in Winder, GA.

According to experts, the mismatch is due to political uncertainty and growing corruption, as the external sector's growth did not support the internal sector. “It’s good that tourism income has grown. This will generate jobs,” said Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director at Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank. “But at the same time, growing remittance earnings means no job prospects at home. But the money sent by migrant workers has boosted foreign exchange reserves to an all-time high.”Though Nepal is in a remittance trap, the country could turn this into an opportunity by investing in the real sector. “The best option to channel remittances is to bring the private sector on board for investment in the productive sector,” said Thapa.Experts said that since the interest rate on credit has dropped significantly due to the huge amount of liquidity, investment is all that the country needs now. In the last fiscal year, Nepal’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased 32.6 percent to Rs2.04 trillion, a historic high. According to experts, such a trend in a least-developed country indicates no investment. According to the central bank report released on Sunday, remittance inflows increased 16.5 percent to Rs1.44 trillion in the last fiscal year, the highest amount on record.The remittances have been increasing because youth are leaving. In the last fiscal year, foreign employment permits were issued for 741,302 individuals (460,103 first-time and 281,199 renewed). The number is a slight reduction from 774,976 in the previous fiscal year.Under the service account, travel income, or expenditure made by foreign tourists, increased 32.1 percent to Rs82.33 billion in the review year, the highest revenue on record. The total number of tourist arrivals increased to 1.12 million in the last fiscal year from 862,992 in the previous fiscal year.The balance of payments remained at a surplus of Rs502.49 billion in the review year.With the upbeat external sector, the internal sector has remained dismal.“This is because the private sector investment has been shrinking for the last two years,” said Chandra Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the apex private sector body. He was speaking at an interaction in Kathmandu on Sunday.“As Nepal’s industrial capacity is under 40 percent. The private sector investment that contributes 86 percent to the economy has shrunk. This will naturally not generate employment opportunities.”He said that the demand for workers has boomed in the country, where the private sector has thrived. The World Bank said in its recent report that frequent political changes, a significant drag on businesses for over a decade, have dampened private investment. Thriving corruption and lack of accountability have stalled growth and forced tens of thousands of young Nepalis to try their luck abroad.Thapa, a former official at the central bank, said that with billions of dollars in the banks, the incumbent government has an opportunity to take advantage of it.Nepal is currently ruled by an unusual coalition of the two largest parties and this brings both challenges and opportunities. “The government has to facilitate the private sector. It has to ask the private sector to bring forward ready-to-invest projects,” said Thapa. The capital market is gaining momentum. “Through initial public offerings (IPOs) and follow-on public offers (FPOs), the government can facilitate raising money and enable the private sector to invest in the productive sectors that create jobs,” said Thapa.

For example, the import restriction imposed by the government two years ago discouraged the private sector from spending, decreasing capital in the market and intermediate goods imports. As a result, public consumption and investment contracted, ultimately impacting the government’s revenue collection.Economists and statisticians say Nepal, which is set to graduate from the least developed countries by 2026, does not have the environment to achieve double-digit economic growth in the immediate future due to low investment from the government and the private sector.The country’s statistical office recently said that, given the ongoing investment, Nepal’s growth rate will neither slow down nor grow.

Delhi turned a blind eye even as Hasina ruled with an iron grip, and her party was accused of rigging elections. The democratic backsliding in the country of 170 million people was not much of a concern for Delhi, as it was content with its strong ties with Hasina.It is surprising that Delhi completely ignored the fact that Hasina had entirely lost touch with the people. When mass protests reached a flashpoint, forcing Hasina to flee on August 5, Delhi was caught off guard by her “request to come to India at a very short notice.” Hasina continues to be in India, her asylum pleas pending.

For India, China’s growing influence in Nepal has snowballed from a minor inconvenience into a constant vexation. It’s not that Nepal has made great strides in terms of trade, transit and power transmission deals with China, but Beijing has deftly employed wolf-warrior diplomacy, evident from its diplomats suddenly coming out of their cocoon, which is not to Delhi’s liking.The renewed push for pending projects and the recent signing of deals in power trade are part of Delhi’s exercise for deeper engagement with Nepal.

Besides, as Nepal’s e-commerce grows, now more than ever, instances of consumers fraud are becoming more prevalent.Nepal’s quality control watchdog, the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control, filed 178 cases in district administration offices against producers and traders for producing and selling substandard food items and animal feed in the last fiscal year. There were 121 cases in the previous fiscal year. Consumer rights activists say the district administrations deliver justice in only a handful of cases.Speaking at the interaction, lawmakers criticised party politics for protecting wrongdoers.They said that whenever market inspection teams raid certain shops or factories, top officials receive phone calls to protect those businesses. On May 28, the budget announced the allocation of necessary funds to set up consumer courts. An official at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies said that the government allocated a budget of Rs10 million for administrative expenses to establish at least one consumer court in one of the districts in Kathmandu Valley. However, setting up consumer courts requires a considerable amount of money. As a temporary measure to comply with the Supreme Court’s order, officials plan to rent a separate room in a district administration office to set up the court, which will then begin hearing cases.Consumer rights activists said that forming a court within a month is impossible.“I attended the function when the industry minister Bhandari delivered his speech. We applauded, and the function concluded,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumers Forum.“This is one of the glaring examples of how promises are made and not delivered.”“A consumer court inside a district administrative office, with a limited budget and few judges, is a joke,” said Maharjan. The top court had ordered the setting up of consumer courts in all 77 districts with separate infrastructure. In mid-June, the Industry Ministry's draft report on establishing a consumer court was submitted to the Law Ministry and sent to the Judicial Council for its suggestions.However, Ashok Kumar Chhetri, spokesperson for the Judicial Council, said he was unaware of the development.“The draft regarding the formation of consumer courts has not come to my notice.” The Consumer Protection Act, 2018, has a provision requiring the government to establish consumer courts. Based on this provision, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies submitted a draft of legislation to the Ministry of Law in September 2019. As the process dragged on, the Supreme Court, on February 20, 2022, ordered the government to establish consumer courts in all provinces to protect buyers' interests amid repeated instances of unfair market practices.A division bench of justices Bam Kumar Shrestha and Nahakul Subedi issued the order after the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights Nepal moved the court. Although the draft reached the Ministry of Law and then the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies, the process has been delayed due to frequent changes in government.According to an official update on the development, the Ministry of Industry cancelled the previous process last year and started afresh by forming a committee.The committee recommended setting up a pilot consumer court in a suitable location within the Kathmandu Valley, in coordination with or on the advice of the Judicial Council, considering the country's current condition and available resources, the official said. According to officials, more consumer courts will be gradually established in other districts based on financial resources.The Industry Ministry official said they realised that setting up just one consumer court per province would not be practical, as people would have to travel long distances for their cases. Therefore, the draft proposes gradually setting up consumer courts in all districts.A consumer court is a specialised court which primarily deals with consumer-related disputes, conflicts, and grievances. The court holds hearings to adjudicate these issues.The public has long been demanding a consumer court to bring unscrupulous traders under a legal framework within a fast-track system.Since consumers often hesitate to get involved in complex court cases, observers believe this has emboldened dishonest traders. They believe that once consumer courts are established, filing complaints will become easier, and the process will involve fewer hassles.

An official at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies said that the government allocated a budget of Rs10 million for administrative expenses to establish at least one consumer court in one of the districts in Kathmandu Valley. However, setting up consumer courts requires a considerable amount of money. As a temporary measure to comply with the Supreme Court’s order, officials plan to rent a separate room in a district administration office to set up the court, which will then begin hearing cases.Consumer rights activists said that forming a court within a month is impossible.“I attended the function when the industry minister Bhandari delivered his speech. We applauded, and the function concluded,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumers Forum.“This is one of the glaring examples of how promises are made and not delivered.”“A consumer court inside a district administrative office, with a limited budget and few judges, is a joke,” said Maharjan. The top court had ordered the setting up of consumer courts in all 77 districts with separate infrastructure. In mid-June, the Industry Ministry's draft report on establishing a consumer court was submitted to the Law Ministry and sent to the Judicial Council for its suggestions.However, Ashok Kumar Chhetri, spokesperson for the Judicial Council, said he was unaware of the development.“The draft regarding the formation of consumer courts has not come to my notice.” The Consumer Protection Act, 2018, has a provision requiring the government to establish consumer courts. Based on this provision, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies submitted a draft of legislation to the Ministry of Law in September 2019. As the process dragged on, the Supreme Court, on February 20, 2022, ordered the government to establish consumer courts in all provinces to protect buyers' interests amid repeated instances of unfair market practices.A division bench of justices Bam Kumar Shrestha and Nahakul Subedi issued the order after the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights Nepal moved the court. Although the draft reached the Ministry of Law and then the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies, the process has been delayed due to frequent changes in government.According to an official update on the development, the Ministry of Industry cancelled the previous process last year and started afresh by forming a committee.The committee recommended setting up a pilot consumer court in a suitable location within the Kathmandu Valley, in coordination with or on the advice of the Judicial Council, considering the country's current condition and available resources, the official said. According to officials, more consumer courts will be gradually established in other districts based on financial resources.The Industry Ministry official said they realised that setting up just one consumer court per province would not be practical, as people would have to travel long distances for their cases. Therefore, the draft proposes gradually setting up consumer courts in all districts.A consumer court is a specialised court which primarily deals with consumer-related disputes, conflicts, and grievances. The court holds hearings to adjudicate these issues.The public has long been demanding a consumer court to bring unscrupulous traders under a legal framework within a fast-track system.Since consumers often hesitate to get involved in complex court cases, observers believe this has emboldened dishonest traders. They believe that once consumer courts are established, filing complaints will become easier, and the process will involve fewer hassles.

While speaking in the House, Dahal had warned the government that a similar incident as in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh might occur in Nepal should the government try to bulldoze its way in the name of majority.“It was not the language to be spoken by the responsible leader,” Oli reportedly said during the politburo meeting.The Maoist Centre has seen its fortunes dwindle sharply over the years. The party, which got 29.28 percent of votes in the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008, could garner only 15.21 percent in the second Constituent Assembly of 2013. Even then, the party's downward journey did not stop. In the general election of 2017, the first after the country adopted the federal structure, the party was limited to 13.66 percent, which further declined during the November 2022 election to 11.13 percent.These data show that public support for the Maoist Centre is diminishing. But rather than acknowledging this fact and focusing on reinvigorating the party’s lost connection with the public, the party leaders often warn of street protests whenever they have some grudges with the leaders of the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML, the two major parties of the country.Political analysts say they do not see any point in leaders from the Maoist Centre and other parties harping on street protests.“In the present context, no political party has any moral ground to bring the common people to the street—maybe a few of their cadres might gather,” Krishna Khanal, a professor of political science, told the Post. “When it comes to the Maoist Centre, they were just unseated from power, so the party might be trying to reinvigorate its members in the name of street protest.”Khanal also says that the Maoist Centre has no moral ground to lead the mass protest. Referring to the latest election, Khanal adds that the Maoist Centre simply does not have enough public support for a large-scale protest. Likewise, CK Lal, another political analyst who is also a columnist for the Post, also does not see any chance for the Maoist Centre to lead any movement.“The Maoist Centre has been discredited because of what they did or didn’t do when they were in power, so I don’t see any chances that they will lead any kind of political movement as the kind that have happened in our South Asian neighbours,” Lal told the Post.However, Maoist Centre leaders have been citing Bangladesh and saying that election results do not matter when organising a mass protest.“Pressurising the government through the House and street is a declared policy of the party,” Dev Gurung, Maoist Centre general secretary, told the Post.On Sunday, the Maoist Centre issued a circular to the party's provincial committees, asking them to be ready for street protests against the government at any time.The circular, signed by party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and General Secretary Dev Gurung, instructs cadres to organise street protests if the government ignores the party’s warning at Parliament.“The party should strongly present its stance in Parliament regarding the regression, treason, protection of corrupt people, and the daily problems faced by the people, among other things,” the circular states. “If the government continues to protect the corrupt people and defend treason, despite our strong voice, we need to consider going to the street any time.”Party members are also instructed to oppose the KP Sharma Oli government “if it tries to obstruct the campaign of good governance that was started during the Dahal-led government.”“The intention to block the anti-corruption campaign and protect the corrupt is clear evidence [that the government is on a wrong path],” the directive said.Khanal, the political science professor, says that if the question of corruption can be raised to other political parties and leaders, the same can be done to Maoist Centre leaders and its chair, Dahal, who has been in power most of the time after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015.The Maoist Centre alleges that the Congress and UML have agreed to amend the constitution and are trying to drive the country towards the 1990 constitution.After the people's movement in 1990 against the 30-year Panchayat system, the country not only gained a democracy but also a constitution that valued constitutional monarchy.“The way the two parties are considering amending the constitution, there is a sign that the country will return to 1990 by reversing the achievements of the federal democratic republic, secular, proportional-inclusive,” the party circular disseminated in the seven provincial party committees claims.Despite being the third largest party (with 32 seats) in the House, Dahal, as the party's leader, became the prime minister for the first 18 months after the November 2022 election. He was unseated from power on July 12, when his chief coalition partner, UML, inked a seven-point agreement with Congress to form the government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli.When the Congress and the UML, the first and second largest parties (with 88 and 78 seats, respectively), inked a deal on July 1, they also agreed to amend the constitution, which is mentioned in the second point of the agreement as read out by Prime Minister Oli from the rostrum of Parliament on July 21 when he was seeking the vote of confidence.After being unseated from power, the Maoist Centre and its leaders have come down heavily on the two parties and their deal. However, the seven-point agreement is not the only reason they are skeptical of the government, experts say.After UML leaders began to accuse Maoist Centre leaders of electricity tariff corruption, they might have resorted to warnings of street protests, experts say. They add that there has been a heated debate recently between the lawmakers of UML and Maoists regarding how to acknowledge the 10-year insurgency, so that may be another reason Maoist Centre leaders are warning of street protest.Political analysts say parties and their leaders should stand for their political convictions based on ideology but it is not a feature of coalition politics.“In coalition politics, the opposition party warns the government of street protest,” Lal told the Post. “However, in reality, they tend not to be up to it.” ","summary":"During the two-day politburo meeting of CPN-UML, which started on Tuesday, party chair and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli briefed members on the alleged attempts by CPN (Maoist Centre) and its chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal to destabilise the government.“After being unseated from power, Dahal has been working to incite some groups to inflame the situation,” a politburo member of the party quoted Oli as saying. “But we won’t let him be successful.”Oli further said that Dahal’s speech in the House of Representatives meeting on August 27 was intended to create chaos.

Shah has accused Oli of failing to act on repeated calls of the metropolitan city to take action against Rekha Sharma, a CPN-UML provincial assembly member in Lumbini who is accused of abusing a child domestic worker for eight years.Back-and-forth between Oli and Shah, a popular rapper, is nothing new. Prior to this, on June 3, Shah had accused Oli of ‘policy corruption’ related to the illegal land swap involving Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in Jhapa. This followed the intervention by then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Raghubir Mahaseth to halt the mayor’s plan to widen pavements in the Capital’s New Road area. On Sunday, writing on social media, Mayor Shah accused Oli of failing to act against Sharma despite repeated calls by the metropolis office for the past two months. “The court has also decided to prosecute the accused,” Shah wrote on Facebook on Sunday. “Respected prime minister, good governance entails taking action against your lawmaker accused of domestic violence.”“Perhaps to you, good governance is limited to announcing a compensation of Rs100,000 and shedding crocodile tears over her death on Facebook,” Mayor Shah said on his Facebook post, which he shared on X. But why has KMC Mayor Shah repeatedly targeted Oli?Political experts suggest that as Shah is not part of the traditional power elite, and those traditional elites are not ready to welcome him, such clashes are to be expected. “Mayor Shah has taken an unconventional approach in dealing with the old political elite, which has increased friction between them,” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, told the Post.Shah had also targeted Oli and his party colleagues earlier when they intervened in the mayor’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area. This time, as the UML is obstructing Shah’s efforts to implement the Supreme Court ruling to vacate the Bagmati riverside land, he has again targeted the party and its chief, according to a close aide to the mayor.Following the Supreme Court’s ruling—whose full text was issued on July 15—ordering authorities to clear settlements along the Bagmati River and its tributaries in the Kathmandu Valley, KMC issued a notice on August 8 to clear the settlements. The KMC notice also bans new construction within an additional 20 metres beyond the previously designated riverbank area.In the full text of the ruling, the Supreme Court also deemed the government’s standard of leaving 20 metres clear on riverbanks to be insufficient and has ordered an additional 20 metres be added.The Supreme Court ruling was against the Cabinet decision of October 17, 2008, which had set the 20-metre clearance requirement for riverside areas in Kathmandu. According to the decision, construction was allowed only if a 20-metre buffer was left on both sides of the Bagmati, Bishnumati and Manohora rivers, while the buffer for other riverbanks is between 4-20 metres. A joint bench of Supreme Court Justice Ananda Mohan Bhattarai and Binod Sharma had issued the order against the earlier cabinet decision. The top court issued a verdict on it on December 19 last year. Soon after the court’s full text came out, KMC had said that it would fully implement the court’s decision. According to the KMC notice, the prohibition on construction will now extend to 40 metres on either side of Bagmati, Bishnumati and Manohara rivers.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted within an additional 20 metres on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.” The Kathmandu district committee of the UML protested the municipal notice. On August 26, the committee also met Prime Minister Oli to express its concerns and requested a judicial review of the Supreme Court’s decision to ban construction on an additional 20 metres of land. “If the KMC notice is implemented, it will not only affect a large section of Kathmandu’s population, but also impact World Heritage sites like the Pashupatinath Temple,” says Rajan Bhattarai, the Bagmati Province in-charge of the UML. “The municipal decision is not pragmatic and its repercussions are already being felt,” Bhattarai told the Post. “Following the municipal notice, homeowners with bank mortgages are in serious trouble as the banks have started demanding alternative collateral.”“While we respect the court’s decision, its implementation will lead to severe financial problems for the country,” Bhattarai added. Subedi, the political analyst, doesn’t agree.“If the court’s decision is problematic, the government has the option to challenge it,” Subedi said. “This has nothing to do with Mayor Shah.”The UML district committee is scheduled to meet with Nepali Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba on Tuesday to discuss the matter, and also plans to meet Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, according to Bhattarai. ","summary":"Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah, known for his maverick style, has once again taken aim at Prime Minister and CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli. Shah has accused Oli of failing to act on repeated calls of the metropolitan city to take action against Rekha Sharma, a CPN-UML provincial assembly member in Lumbini who is accused of abusing a child domestic worker for eight years.Back-and-forth between Oli and Shah, a popular rapper, is nothing new. Prior to this, on June 3, Shah had accused Oli of ‘policy corruption’ related to the illegal land swap involving Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in Jhapa. This followed the intervention by then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Raghubir Mahaseth to halt the mayor’s plan to widen pavements in the Capital’s New Road area. On Sunday, writing on social media, Mayor Shah accused Oli of failing to act against Sharma despite repeated calls by the metropolis office for the past two months. “The court has also decided to prosecute the accused,” Shah wrote on Facebook on Sunday. “Respected prime minister, good governance entails taking action against your lawmaker accused of domestic violence.”“Perhaps to you, good governance is limited to announcing a compensation of Rs100,000 and shedding crocodile tears over her death on Facebook,” Mayor Shah said on his Facebook post, which he shared on X. But why has KMC Mayor Shah repeatedly targeted Oli?Political experts suggest that as Shah is not part of the traditional power elite, and those traditional elites are not ready to welcome him, such clashes are to be expected. “Mayor Shah has taken an unconventional approach in dealing with the old political elite, which has increased friction between them,” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, told the Post.Shah had also targeted Oli and his party colleagues earlier when they intervened in the mayor’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area. This time, as the UML is obstructing Shah’s efforts to implement the Supreme Court ruling to vacate the Bagmati riverside land, he has again targeted the party and its chief, according to a close aide to the mayor.Following the Supreme Court’s ruling—whose full text was issued on July 15—ordering authorities to clear settlements along the Bagmati River and its tributaries in the Kathmandu Valley, KMC issued a notice on August 8 to clear the settlements. The KMC notice also bans new construction within an additional 20 metres beyond the previously designated riverbank area.In the full text of the ruling, the Supreme Court also deemed the government’s standard of leaving 20 metres clear on riverbanks to be insufficient and has ordered an additional 20 metres be added.The Supreme Court ruling was against the Cabinet decision of October 17, 2008, which had set the 20-metre clearance requirement for riverside areas in Kathmandu. According to the decision, construction was allowed only if a 20-metre buffer was left on both sides of the Bagmati, Bishnumati and Manohora rivers, while the buffer for other riverbanks is between 4-20 metres. A joint bench of Supreme Court Justice Ananda Mohan Bhattarai and Binod Sharma had issued the order against the earlier cabinet decision. The top court issued a verdict on it on December 19 last year. Soon after the court’s full text came out, KMC had said that it would fully implement the court’s decision. According to the KMC notice, the prohibition on construction will now extend to 40 metres on either side of Bagmati, Bishnumati and Manohara rivers.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted within an additional 20 metres on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.” The Kathmandu district committee of the UML protested the municipal notice.

Announcing the date of the next general convention was one of the contentious issues at the central committee, which met for almost a month with gaps in between. Now the committee decided to hold the convention as per the party’s statute—but without specifying the convention dates.Under the party charter, every elected body is given a four-year term. The charter provides a year’s extension if the general convention cannot be held within four years. Further, if an emergency renders it impossible to hold the convention, Nepal’s constitution permits a six-month postponement.During the central committee meeting, the dissident faction in the Congress demanded that the next general convention be held on time, that is by the end of 2025. But a final decision was made without specifying the dates, giving the leadership the room for manoeuvre.But party general secretary Gagan Thapa denies the charge. On the general convention, the agreement reached is a win-win for both the rival and establishment factions, he said.“Before declaring the general convention we had to form a legislative committee, to which the central committee agreed,” Thapa told the Post. “Not declaring the date of general convention may have given the impression of victory to the party president, but there was also a win for us when the party agreed to form a legislation drafting committee.” Even though the party statute mentions that a general convention should be held every four years, the same statute also allows for a one-year postponement of the convention. The legislation committee will be entrusted to draft the party’s statute that is endorsed by the periodic convention. The Congress secretariat members also say the party wouldn’t be able to hold the general convention by the end of 2025 even if the dates were declared. The party’s statute mentions that a year before the general convention, the party should complete conventions at the local level. For that, the party must hold its local conventions by the end of December. The Congress central committee meeting, which was supposed to end on August 28, was extended until Sunday in the absence of consensus among the top leaders on the report presented by the general-secretary duo. The central committee’s concluding meeting also decided to pass the policy proposal presented by Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka, the organisational proposal presented by General Secretary Thapa, and the contemporary political proposal presented by Bishwa Prakash Sharma at the party’s Mahasamiti meeting back in February.The Mahasamiti meeting unanimously passed the three important proposals of Khadka, Thapa, and Sharma. However, it had also kept the space open for the central working committee to modify the proposal before its endorsement. A meeting of the present and former Congress office bearers on Saturday decided to take a midway approach to the two proposals that Thapa and Sharma presented during the Mahasamiti meeting. The party leaders have no fundamental differences on the proposal presented by Vice-president Khadka. In Thapa’s proposal, he urges not forging a political alliance for the next election, among other things, while Sharma had proposed the ‘exit policy.’ For consensus on the proposal tabled by the two general secretaries, Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba sat with them multiple times before Sunday’s meeting.The meeting approved Thapa’s proposal with minor changes but Sharma’s paper has been pushed back to be considered while amending the constitution as it includes broad national issues such as term limits on persons serving as the country’s president or the prime minister, party leaders say. “General Secretary Sharma’s proposal was related not only to the party’s statute but also to the constitution, so the party has decided to raise the issue while amending the constitution,” Prakash Saran Mahat, the party spokesperson, told the Post.On Thapa’s proposal, the central committee decided that all the party’s supporters and well-wishers would vote for the Congress symbol of ‘tree’ in the next election without mentioning whether the party would forge any election alliance.However, Thapa claims that his original proposal presented at the Mahasamiti meeting has been passed by the central committee. “There are no changes.”Min Bahadur Bishwokarma, the party’s publicity department head, has a different take. “Yes, we decided that our well-wishers and party supporters will be able to stamp on the party’s election symbol in the next election,” Bishwokarma told the Post. “But we have not ruled out electoral alliances either.”Party leaders close to Deuba are in favour of leaving the final decision on strategic issues like forging alliances to election-time. The proposal that the party passed is open to electoral alliances, though the preference is not to forge such alliances, Bishowkarma said. In his contemporary political proposal, Sharma has proposed an ‘exit policy for senior leaders', recommending term limits: one term for the [country’s] President, two terms for prime ministers, three terms for ministers, and four terms for lawmakers. The central committee also has given legitimacy to the seven-point agreement it signed with the CPN-UML. The two parties forged a governing coalition based on the July 1 agreement. Under this, UML chair and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli would hand over the reins to Deuba after two years. “Our party is committed to the power-sharing deal with the UML,” Thapa told the Post. “As the country’s two largest parties have come together to form the government, we don’t have the luxury of failing to deliver. Only through delivery can we remove public disenchantment towards the political parties,” Thapa said. “We have agreed to give the government our full support.” ","summary":"The Nepali Congress Central Working Committee on Sunday decided to hold the 15th general convention as stipulated in the party charter.

Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” ","summary":"The rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers.

The goods, mainly readymade garments and fruits, were stuck in the Nyalam and Khasa towns for 15 days. The tunnel's construction had worried Nepali traders who had ordered goods for the upcoming festivals.As Dashain, the biggest festival in Nepal, is nearing, many traders were worried, said trader Kapil Pakhrin.According to the Tatopani Dry Port and Customs Office, around 100 containers were stuck at the border. Traders, however, fear that clearing the logjam may take many days.According to the Department of Customs, imports from China increased 34.2 percent to Rs298.77 billion in the last fiscal year, which ended mid-July.Similarly, exports to China increased 46.6 percent to Rs2.58 billion in the review period.Nepal’s trade deficit with China remained negative at Rs296.18 billion.Tribhuvan Dhar Tuladhar, president of the Nepal Trans Himalayan Association, said cargo containers are in the queue and may take 8–10 days to arrive in Kathmandu from Nyalam.In Nyalam, cargo containers are in queue due to inadequate parking space in Khasa, he said.Tuladhar said traders prefer bringing goods from the Tatopani side because the shorter distance compared to the Kerung route means less cost.

According to the association, the trucks are mostly carrying readymade garments, apples, garlic, onions, and hydropower equipment.It costs around 1,000 Chinese Yuan (Rs18,855) daily as the parking charge in Naylam and nearby places.Traders said that around 23 containers carrying Chinese fruits are stuck in the Nyalam region. “Some fruits have started decaying in the container,” Pakhrin said.One Chinese container carries goods equal to three Nepali trucks.With an aim to make Khasa a smart city within three years, 50 percent of the old construction has already been demolished.

Gurung started harvesting apples two weeks ago after they began turning red.However, he faces a big problem. Transportation in the southern part of Gorkha has become a major issue due to heavy monsoon rains that have severely damaged the roads. Despite the excellent harvest, apple farmers like Gurung are deeply frustrated.“I have around 400 kg of apples sitting unsold,” said Gurung, who started an apple farm four years ago. “It’s been two weeks, and I still haven't been able to send them to the market.”This year, he harvested over 670 kg of apples from 900 trees in his orchard, which started producing apples last year. In the first batch, he harvested 200 kg and distributed them to neighbours and relatives as souvenirs.“This year, the young apple trees yielded 3 to 4 kg of apples per tree. I managed to sell 200 kg to the hotels along the trekking in Philim and Manasulu by carrying them in bamboo baskets on my back,” he said. He has another 400 kgs of apples stored at home. “There are still some apples on the trees,” said Gurung. “If I don’t pluck them soon, they will fall,” Gurung said. “But there is no vehicle to transport apples to the market.”It takes three hours to reach Philim Bazar on foot.The track to Larke, which was opened in the winter and allowed jeeps, trucks, and tractors to reach Pangsing Pass, one of the routes connecting the Chinese border in the north, has now been blocked by frequent landslides and mudslides, particularly during the ongoing monsoon season.Lapu is the closest station where vehicles are available, but it is a day-long hike from his farm.Apple farmers say they have the option of transporting apples on the backs of mules, but there is a big risk of damaging the fruits.Gurung, who runs Pati Krishi Tatha Pashupanchhi Farm, sold apples for Rs250 per kg in the village, but there were few customers.Villagers say that supplying apples to the market at this time of year fetches a better price.Gurung returned to Nepal in 2011 after working as a migrant in Malaysia and started livestock farming and agriculture. He invested Rs5 million in his farm, which has 600 walnut plants.Commercial apple farming has thrived in areas like Pangsing and Aagasarseu of Shardibas, and in Namrung of Chumnubri Rural Municipality. However, lack of transportation has left commercial apple growers frustrated, as they face the prospect of losing considerable income this year just before Nepal’s biggest festivals—Dashain and Tihar, which fall in October-November.There are more than 12,000 apple orchards in Namrung. Lakpa Thendup Lama, who also decided to engage in apple farming four years ago in Namrung, is facing a tough year. “This year, apple yield has doubled, and harvesting has already begun,” Lama said. But, the lack of transportation has dampened his spirits. “Last year, too, we sold our apples to tourists and hotels in the Manasulu area.” Lama recalled. He had hoped to get a good price for his apples by supplying them to the markets, but has not been able to do so.He plans to turn the unsold apples into sukuti (dried fruit). He has branded the fruit as ‘Chumnubri Apple’.It takes around three days to reach Arughat from Namrung.“Jeeps used to operate in Pangsing, but with the roads in poor condition, they are now empty, and so is our business,” Lama said.Lama has an apple orchard on 300 ropani (15.26 hectares) .Two years ago, he exported apples to Kathmandu by helicopter, but it was too costly, he said.“Supplying apples by helicopter is not possible now. It costs Rs250,000 a trip.”Several varieties of apples, like golden, fuji, and red delicious, are grown in Gorkha.The area is 2,650 metres from sea level, giving a geographical advantage for producing apples.Ashok Joshi, chief of the agriculture department in the rural municipality, said there has been a rapid increase in commercial apple growers in Chumnumbri.“It has been 4-5 years since commercial apple farming started in the region. There are 6-7 commercial growers now.”“Apple production has increased this year compared to last year.However, Joshi pointed out that the high cost of transportation and the lack of storage facilities are major concerns, which have dampened the spirits of Nepali growers who aim to reduce imports.Nepal imported 82,145 tonnes of apples in the last fiscal year, amounting to Rs8.44 billion, mainly from China.The locals said the improved road connectivity could help reduce import of apples.

It spreads in humans when bitten by infected chiggers (larval mites) found in mice.Until a few years ago, it was believed that people residing in rural areas or those working in grasslands or fields were at high risk. However, urban populations are also now being affected by the disease.“Over 100 people from Hetauda Sub-metropolitan city have been infected from Scrub typhus this year,” said Krishna Bahadur Major, chief of the Health Office, Makawanpur. “Although more cases are reported in villages, urban areas are not immune, with several positive cases emerging there as well.”Doctors point out high fever, headache, abdominal pain, backache, joint and muscle pain, red rash, nausea and vomiting as some of the symptoms of scrub typhus infection. Patients with severe illness may develop bleeding which could lead to organ failure. The infection can lead to respiratory distress, inflation of brain, lungs, kidney failure and then multi-organ failure. If not treated immediately, it could be fatal.Nepal saw a surge in scrub typhus cases after the calamitous 2015 earthquakes that killed nearly 9,000 persons across the country.Three months after the quakes, the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, alerted the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division about six children with unusual fevers and severe respiratory problems.Serum samples were collected for subsequent tests in Kathmandu and Bangkok, which confirmed a scrub typhus outbreak. By then, four children had already died in the course of the treatment. By the end of the year, 101 cases were confirmed in 16 districts, and four more people succumbed to the disease.The magnitude of the outbreak escalated in 2016 when 831 cases of scrub typhus were reported in 47 districts, and 14 people died by the end of that year.According to the Ministry of Health and Population data, more than 1,026 people were infected with the disease in 2020. Their number increased to 1,999 in 2021, and it rose to more than 2,900 in 2022.In 2023, over 5,000 people were infected with the deadly disease. Doctors say the risk of severity and fatality can be minimised if the patients are diagnosed and treated early, they say.Ordinary antibiotics, such as doxycycline and azithromycin, which are on the essential drugs list supplied by the government to health facilities across the country for free distribution, can cure the disease.However, what is concerning is that many health workers, including doctors, lack sufficient knowledge about diagnosing scrub typhus. Many health facilities also lack reagents to carry out tests for the disease.Doctors can diagnose the disease based on the symptoms, but the risk of misdiagnosis is high, as scrub typhus symptoms are similar to those of other illnesses. They warn that waiting for lab results before starting treatment could be dangerous. It can take about a week to get lab results, and by that time, if the patient is not treated can fall into a coma and suffer multi-organ failure. ","summary":"Over 3,500 people across the country have been infected with scrub typhus since mid-July, the start of this fiscal year.Officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division say they expect more cases in the coming days as the disease typically peaks in September.“Like in previous years, hundreds of people have also been infected with scrub typhus this year,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of vector Control Section at the division. “More people can get infected in the coming days, as the peak season is still ahead.”Scrub typhus, or bush typhus, is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Orientia tsutsugamushi, a mite-borne bacterium. It spreads in humans when bitten by infected chiggers (larval mites) found in mice.Until a few years ago, it was believed that people residing in rural areas or those working in grasslands or fields were at high risk. However, urban populations are also now being affected by the disease.“Over 100 people from Hetauda Sub-metropolitan city have been infected from Scrub typhus this year,” said Krishna Bahadur Major, chief of the Health Office, Makawanpur. “Although more cases are reported in villages, urban areas are not immune, with several positive cases emerging there as well.”Doctors point out high fever, headache, abdominal pain, backache, joint and muscle pain, red rash, nausea and vomiting as some of the symptoms of scrub typhus infection. Patients with severe illness may develop bleeding which could lead to organ failure. The infection can lead to respiratory distress, inflation of brain, lungs, kidney failure and then multi-organ failure. If not treated immediately, it could be fatal.Nepal saw a surge in scrub typhus cases after the calamitous 2015 earthquakes that killed nearly 9,000 persons across the country.Three months after the quakes, the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, alerted the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division about six children with unusual fevers and severe respiratory problems.Serum samples were collected for subsequent tests in Kathmandu and Bangkok, which confirmed a scrub typhus outbreak. By then, four children had already died in the course of the treatment. By the end of the year, 101 cases were confirmed in 16 districts, and four more people succumbed to the disease.The magnitude of the outbreak escalated in 2016 when 831 cases of scrub typhus were reported in 47 districts, and 14 people died by the end of that year.According to the Ministry of Health and Population data, more than 1,026 people were infected with the disease in 2020. Their number increased to 1,999 in 2021, and it rose to more than 2,900 in 2022.In 2023, over 5,000 people were infected with the deadly disease. Doctors say the risk of severity and fatality can be minimised if the patients are diagnosed and treated early, they say.Ordinary antibiotics, such as doxycycline and azithromycin, which are on the essential drugs list supplied by the government to health facilities across the country for free distribution, can cure the disease.However, what is concerning is that many health workers, including doctors, lack sufficient knowledge about diagnosing scrub typhus. Many health facilities also lack reagents to carry out tests for the disease.Doctors can diagnose the disease based on the symptoms, but the risk of misdiagnosis is high, as scrub typhus symptoms are similar to those of other illnesses. They warn that waiting for lab results before starting treatment could be dangerous. It can take about a week to get lab results, and by that time, if the patient is not treated can fall into a coma and suffer multi-organ failure.

Patients’ visitors have to hold the IV bags or we have to improvise by tying them to windows.”This situation is becoming increasingly common in hospitals in many districts, which are seeing a spike in patient numbers amid a massive dengue outbreak. The virus has spread to 75 of the country’s 77 districts, killing at least three people and infecting 5,119 others since January. Two mountain districts—Humla and Mustang—have yet to record dengue cases this year. “For the last three years, we have witnessed a dengue epidemic during the monsoon season,” said Jayaru. “We can only request our staff to serve extra hours, but cannot provide equipment or expand bed numbers.”Doctors say most patients do not want to be referred to other places, as reaching Dharan, the nearest city, in an ambulance takes over six hours. Holding seriously ill patients in ill-equipped hospitals is risky as they lack consultant doctors, blood transfusion services, and high-tech laboratories, among other things.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed by the influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks, both vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and spiking patient flow.”Of the 5,119 cases of the dengue cases reported, only 77 cases are from Madhesh Province, which is traditionally an endemic area. Health Ministry officials admit that the disease is shifting towards hills and mountain regions due to climate change. They say other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, are also contributing to the spread of the disease to new areas. “Yes, new challenges have increased in areas previously considered less risky, but we have not strengthened our health facilities to deal with the emerging challenges accordingly,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Our health system is not is not designed to address these evolving risks.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organization, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.In 2023, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus across the country.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.Back in 2019, dengue killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal over the past few years with cases consistently rising each year.Epidemiologists as well as virologists now consider the dengue virus as a major public health problem in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of persons getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities have not taken the situation seriously. The lackadaisical approach, they believe, is contributing to the spread of the virus. They call for implementing measures such as search-and-destroy drives and awareness campaigns to control dengue vectors.A report by the United Nations titled “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for the dengue-carrying mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death.

The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 report, stunting decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.Even though the health survey report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces. More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Likewise, around 10 percent of children under the age of five years in Madhesh Province have been found suffering from wasting.Officials said the new study was required to determine the latest progress on the population's nutrition conditions.“The nutrition status of the adolescent population will be monitored by schools, while health facilities will monitor children, pregnant women, and new mothers,” said Thapa. “Health workers will also take classes in schools to educate students about the importance of good nutrition and counsel pregnant women and new mothers at health facilities.”Along with the lack of sufficient nutrient foods, poor sanitation and lack of safe drinking water and treatment are blamed for wasting.Doctors say malnutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of complications and maternal and neonatal deaths, as well as the likelihood of low birth weight. It is a major impediment to growth, affecting human capital and economic productivity of a country.Experts say nutrition is directly linked to the country's overall development. Malnutrition affects children's physical and mental growth, which ultimately affects the country’s economic health.It weakens intellectual capacity, limits productivity in adulthood, and increases vulnerability to certain diseases.Nutritionists ask authorities to promote locally available foods, educate people about the importance of a nutritious diet, and provide fortified flour to improve nutritional conditions and reduce dependency on freely distributed foods.Nepal also has an international obligation to improve the condition of malnourished children.To meet the SDG targets, the country needs to reduce stunting to 15 percent from the current 32 percent by 2030, wasting to four percent from the current eight percent, underweight condition to 10 percent from the existing 19 percent, and anaemia to 10 percent from more than 43 percent at present.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals, (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.

Her newborn baby was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of the hospital due to health complications, and the mother was under care in the maternity ward.“We had to start her on anti-depressants, as she was showing serious symptoms, including suicidal thoughts,” said Dr Pratikshya Ghimire, a psychiatrist at the hospital. “She felt sad all the time, worried about the newborn's future, and had lost her appetite.” Mental health problems during pregnancy are the second leading cause of maternal deaths, after excessive bleeding during childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, and pre-eclampsia [pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders. A report on maternal mortality unveiled last year by the National Statistics Office showed that six percent of maternal deaths were due to self-harm (suicide), with most cases occurring during pregnancy.To address mental health problems during pregnancy, the Ministry of Health and Population has started outpatient care services at the Maternity Hospital.“We have not only started outpatient care but also begun screening inpatients for mental health conditions,” said Dr Ghimire. “We have diagnosed around a dozen and a half patients with serious mental health problems.”According to Dr Ghimire, the woman had an inter-caste marriage, and neither her in-laws nor her own parents accepted her marriage, contributing to her mental health struggles. Several other pregnant women and new mothers have also been found suffering from mental health problems, each at various stages of severity.“The Health Ministry had deputed one psychiatric doctor to our hospital, and we started offering outpatient services after her arrival,” said Dr Shree Prasad Adhikari, the hospital's director. “We are also working on training all hospital staff in mental health screening so that conditions can be diagnosed early. Once mental health problems are identified, patients can be referred to specialists.”Officials hope that screening pregnant women for mental health problems and providing prompt treatment will help reduce maternal deaths, which have been rising alarmingly of late.Doctors say prenatal and postnatal depression can occur at any time during pregnancy or after childbirth. Shifts in hormone levels during pregnancy and after childbirth can significantly affect mood. Many women feel anxious about changes happening to their bodies. Some may even have financial concerns and some worry about taking on new and additional responsibilities.Some women experience extreme sadness, anxiety, fatigue, and changes in sleeping and eating habits during pregnancy or after childbirth. Experts warn that prenatal and postnatal depression along with anxiety and other mental health issues, can lead some women to take their own lives.They also emphasise that excessive bleeding after childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, pre-eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders), and suicide are preventable. “Timely screening for mental health problems and proper counselling can significantly reduce the mental health problems faced by pregnant women and new mothers,” said Adhikari. “We have launched this initiative at our hospital, and this is something other hospitals should also implement.”Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016. For this, the country also received a Millennium Development Goals award. The 2021 census report showed that in every 100,000 live births, 151 women died from maternity-related complications. According to the report, 88 maternal deaths were prevented in every 100,000 live births between 2016 and 2021.

It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge.

This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  "},{"hash":"a90b9db6c3c38cf48a1d63805bc18a62428b153ecbe76daccdb8010d4b8e3b5d","title":"this-summer-i-saw-the-everest-up-close","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/travel/2024/06/23/this-summer-i-saw-the-everest-up-close","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/main-1719107987.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1719100800000,"source":"kp","category":"travel","content":"“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask.

How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it.

The Israeli response in Gaza has killed more than 40,700 people, according to Palestinian health authorities.Lammy said Monday's decision was not a judgment on whether Israel had breached international law or not.Israel and Palestinian leaders have dismissed allegations of war crimes.“This is a forward-looking evaluation, not a determination of innocence or guilt, and it does not prejudge any future determinations by the competent courts,” he said.According to information provided by government officials to Reuters and data from the Department for Business and Trade's Export Control unit, the value of permits granted for the sale of military equipment to its ally fell by more than 95% to a 13-year low after the start of the war in Gaza.Many of the licences approved in the period after the start of the conflict were for items listed for “commercial use” or non-lethal items such as body armour, military helmets or all-wheel drive vehicles with ballistic protection.Despite winning a landslide victory in July, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's party did suffer significant setbacks in areas with large Muslim populations and he has been under pressure from some of his lawmakers to take a firmer line with Israel over the conflict.Military ComponentsAmong the items included under the arms export suspension will be components for military aircraft including fighter jets, helicopters and drones.But, parts for F-35 fighters will be exempted, except where going directly to Israel, as the government said it was not possible to suspend these without prejudicing the jets’ entire global programme.“The government’s statement today that it is suspending 30 arms export licences to Israel is a belated, but welcome move, finally acting upon the overwhelming evidence of Israeli war crimes in Gaza,” said Sam Perlo-Freeman, Research Coordinator for Campaign Against Arms Trade said. “But exempting parts for Israel’s F-35 is utterly outrageous and unjustifiable.”Unlike the United States of America, Britain’s government does not give arms directly to Israel but rather issues licences for companies to sell weapons, with input from lawyers on whether they complied with international law.Earlier this month, the US approved the sale of $20 billion in fighter jets and other military equipment to Israel.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

Despite this, many individuals, including foreign observers and researchers, remain unclear about how these provincial budgets are formulated. Questions often arise regarding the process, the legal frameworks that guide them, and the overall structure of provincial budget formulation. This article delves into the legal aspects of provincial budget formulation to offer insights into the processes and regulations that shape this crucial aspect of governance.Budget, a formal statement of projected resources and expenditures for various programmes and projects, promotes socio-economic development, infrastructure growth, gender equality, information technology advancement and good governance within a fiscal year. It is a detailed plan that outlines the government's financial strategy for a specific period, including revenue generation and fund allocation. A well-structured budget incorporates planning elements such as setting objectives, defining strategies, estimating resources and establishing standards for monitoring and evaluation.Provincial budgetEach province’s Minister of Economic Affairs and Planning is responsible for presenting the provincial budget to the legislature. This includes revenue estimates, expenditures from the consolidated fund and other financial details necessary for the transparent functioning of the provincial government. Provincial governments are tasked with formulating plans that enhance socioeconomic development and improve connectivity within their respective jurisdictions, as defined by the Constitution and various laws. The interdependence between planning and budgeting is crucial as it allows provinces to exercise their power to make laws, decisions and budgets and effectively implement plans and policies.While the timing and key elements of the budget submission are consistent across provinces, the preparation process may vary slightly. However, the foundational legal frameworks, such as the Finance Procedure Act, 2074, and the Intergovernmental Fiscal Management Act, 2074, provide a consistent basis for budget formulation across the provinces.The budget preparation process begins with the projection of revenue and expenditure. Under the Intergovernmental Finance Arrangement Act, 2074, provincial governments in Nepal must submit detailed financial statistics, including revenue and expenditure projections for the upcoming fiscal year, to the Federal Ministry of Finance by mid-January (Poush). This step is crucial as it sets the stage for the federal government to make the projected details of revenue distribution and fiscal equalisation grants available to the provincial governments by mid-March (Falgun). The coordination between federal and provincial governments at this stage ensures that resources are adequately distributed, allowing provinces to plan their budgets effectively.Following this, the Finance Procedure Act, 2074, mandates the development of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) in all seven provinces. The MTEF is an essential tool for budget formulation as it provides a functional overview of proposed plans and programmes, including expected costs, returns and duration. It also prioritises all plans and programmes, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently and that the budget aligns with the long-term development goals of the province.The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Planning (MoEAP) plays a pivotal role in forecasting the necessary resources and expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year, which must be completed by mid-February (Magh). To facilitate this process, a Resource Estimation Committee can be established, drawing on the expertise of various stakeholders. Provinces have a Policy and Planning Commission, with Resource Committees in Karnali and Sudurpaschim under the Economic Affairs Secretary's chairmanship, and in Koshi Province and Bagmati Province under the Minister of Economic Affairs' chairmanship. These committees are responsible for estimating the resources and expenditures based on the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and presenting their findings to the Minister of Economic Affairs, ensuring that the budget is grounded in realistic financial projections.Once the resource estimation is complete, the MoEAP must send budget ceilings, guidelines and other directives to the relevant ministries and line agencies by the second week of March (Falgun). These budget ceilings and guidelines must be entered into the Province Line Ministry Budget Information System (PLMBIS) and communicated to the concerned ministries and agencies. The ministries then prepare their budget proposals and policies for the upcoming fiscal year, adhering to the provided ceilings and guidelines, and submit them to the MoEAP within the stipulated time frame.The provincial ministries and line agencies are crucial in the budget formulation process. They must submit detailed plans and budgets, adhering to the ceilings and guidelines provided by the MoEAP, within the required timeframe. According to the Finance Procedure Act, these plans must be based on the MTEF and include projections of revenue sources and expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year and the following two years. When proposing the budget, ministries must also submit the physical and financial progress reports for the previous fiscal year and the first six months of the current fiscal year. These budgets are then discussed at the MoEAP and the provincial Policy and Planning Commission, ensuring alignment with the province’s overall development goals.Discussion and formulationA critical component of the budget preparation process is the pre-budget discussion. At least two months before the budget submission, the MoEAP is required to present the budget’s principles, objectives, priorities and key policies to the Province Assembly for pre-budget discussions. This step allows for a thorough examination of the proposed budget, ensuring that it reflects the province’s development priorities and is aligned with the broader goals of the provincial government.The final stage in the budget formulation process is submitting the budget to the Province Assembly. Each provincial Minister of Economic Affairs and Planning should submit the estimates of revenue and expenditure for the upcoming fiscal year to the Province Assembly by June 15 (Ashad 1). According to the Finance Procedure Act, this submission must include the expenditures to be incurred from the Provincial Consolidated Fund and those authorised by the Province Finance Act and the previous fiscal year’s actual revenue and expenditure, MTEF, grants, public debt and investments. This comprehensive presentation ensures transparency and allows for informed decision-making by the provincial legislature.Once the budget is approved and the Appropriation Act or the Advance Expenditure Act is released, authorised agencies can begin utilising the allocated funds as outlined in the annexes or schedules of the Appropriation Act. The Finance Procedure Act provides clear guidelines for the distribution and expenditure of these funds to ensure effective and efficient use of resources. When multiple agencies are involved, the upper office must distribute the funds within seven days. If funds under one ministry are to be used by another, the receiving agency's secretary must authorise the expenditure. Payments are processed through the treasury single account system, with the agency head responsible for expenditure management, accounting, reporting and addressing any discrepancies.If the expected funds specified in the Province Appropriation Act are not received, the MoEAP can reallocate the funds to other budget headings according to the rules. It also publishes semi-annual and annual evaluation reports on budget implementation. The Intergovernmental Finance Management Act, 2074, requires all government levels to conduct annual budget implementation reviews and make these reports public by mid-November (Kartik). To maintain consistency in financial reporting, provincial governments must use an accounting system aligned with the federal government's, which the Auditor General approves.Finally, Nepal's provincial budgeting and planning process, grounded in a strong legal framework, ensures transparency, accountability and effective resource allocation. This approach enables provincial governments to align budgets with development goals, maintain financial discipline and address regional needs, contributing to overall socioeconomic growth and efficient resource utilisation.

It is another matter that the Cold War is over and the hatred of communism has outlived its utility. The US is courting communist Vietnam without giving up entirely on communist China. Second—even though it required a marked paring down of Hindutva’s love of Hitler—a fawning relationship with Islamophobic Israel has defined India’s recent policy preferences.Modi’s seeking a second term for Donald Trump in 2020 was of a piece with his anti-Muslim politics. India’s recently unveiled citizenship laws came from this prejudice. A third constant in the Modi foreign policy, according to Noorani sahib, was the lure of acceptance with the Indian diaspora, chiefly the type managed and plied by Hindutva’s overseas infrastructures. The Howdy Modi element has thus remained a mainstay of the policy.How does the South Asia neighbourhood appear in this preordained ideological posture?“The era of uninterrupted dialogue is over,” says India’s foreign minister although the claim is problematic on two grounds. First, there’s scant evidence of any uninterrupted dialogue happening ever with Pakistan. Two, who will talk to Pakistan about issues raised by India on the political violence in Kashmir if not India?The foreign minister’s remarks, reportedly made at a private event last week, were said to re-frame the country’s future ties with Pakistan. S Jaishankar said India would respond in kind to adverse signals from Pakistan. The threat has been milked dry by the current government. Many Indians, including a former governor of Jammu and Kashmir, once closely allied with PM Modi, have learnt to take such claims with a pinch of salt.

It is another matter that the Cold War is over and the hatred of communism has outlived its utility. The US is courting communist Vietnam without giving up entirely on communist China. Second—even though it required a marked paring down of Hindutva’s love of Hitler—a fawning relationship with Islamophobic Israel has defined India’s recent policy preferences.Modi’s seeking a second term for Donald Trump in 2020 was of a piece with his anti-Muslim politics. India’s recently unveiled citizenship laws came from this prejudice. A third constant in the Modi foreign policy, according to Noorani sahib, was the lure of acceptance with the Indian diaspora, chiefly the type managed and plied by Hindutva’s overseas infrastructures. The Howdy Modi element has thus remained a mainstay of the policy.How does the South Asia neighbourhood appear in this preordained ideological posture?“The era of uninterrupted dialogue is over,” says India’s foreign minister although the claim is problematic on two grounds. First, there’s scant evidence of any uninterrupted dialogue happening ever with Pakistan. Two, who will talk to Pakistan about issues raised by India on the political violence in Kashmir if not India?The foreign minister’s remarks, reportedly made at a private event last week, were said to re-frame the country’s future ties with Pakistan. S Jaishankar said India would respond in kind to adverse signals from Pakistan. The threat has been milked dry by the current government. Many Indians, including a former governor of Jammu and Kashmir, once closely allied with PM Modi, have learnt to take such claims with a pinch of salt. S Jaishankar also said India would yield to positive gestures from across the border.

The locals discovered the crime in a nearby forest several months after the gruesome murder. The Myagdi police have recently arrested the suspects and are collecting evidence to present to the court. The victim’s parents are too poor and unable to speak out, but some local Dalits have been pressurising the district administration to deliver justice through street demonstrations and lobbying. As Myagdi’s Chief District Officer and Police officials tried to reassure us during our meeting, the legal process seems to be progressing smoothly. Unlike in most cases of violence against Dalits, political parties haven't interfered with the legal process on behalf of the murderer. Yet the agitating Dalits aren’t entirely convinced of a positive outcome. They will continue to monitor the case closely, and our activist organisation, the Caste Watch Network (CWN), will do the same from our end in Kathmandu. The persistent interference of corrupt and immoral politicians has worsened a poorly resourced and unreliable judicial system. This issue has severely impacted the entire country. People of all castes, particularly the poor and the marginalised, suffer from the denial of justice. The numbers of Dalits affected by this are, however, disproportionately higher. We need to reform and revitalise the political and legal systems to get to the bottom of the dire situation of Dalits and seek appropriate remedies. The government and policymakers must pay more attention to the informal causes of caste violence and other forms of Dalit suffering, namely the religious and the spiritual. Hidden in plain sight Nepal’s Dalits suffer from what Columbia University Professor Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak famously called “epistemic violence”. This means that the upper castes control what they know and how they know. Dalit heads have Bahun brains; Dalit eyes have Bahun visions. They are often unable to separate the wheat from the chaff.Let me be more explicit with a typical example of Dalit exclusion in towns. Most Dalits, including politicians and activists, struggle to rent property in places like Kathmandu, Pokhara and Beni because of the landlord’s fear of offending their lineage deities and ancestral spirits. There’s a wide understanding that the family deities and spirits don’t tolerate the breakdown of traditional caste rules, especially intermixing with the low caste.In reality, Dalit intelligentsia and political class hardly ever mention this widely experienced cause of Dalit suffering. They may express their outrage and even take to the streets when the media covers an incident. Still, they don’t seriously consider targeting the causes rooted in religious and spiritual beliefs. Most of the time, they dream of and talk about securing a place in the state mechanism. As instructed by their upper-caste political masters, Dalit activists believe that proportional representation and implementation of the modern laws alone would end caste discrimination. They fail to highlight that casteist texts and traditions, rituals and customs amongst Hindus and (to a degree) other faiths have effectively blocked the modern anti-caste laws. The same epistemological confusion among mainstream Dalits surfaced in our discussion with Dalit activists in Beni on Sunday afternoon. Those deeply involved in party politics argued that religion had little or no influence on perpetuating the exclusion of and violence against Dalits. For them, proportional representation of Dalits in the state, including parliament and government, was paramount. But the parents and close relatives of the murder victim—who lived in a remote village and were uneducated and inactive in party politics—had no delusions about the role of religious beliefs and practices in the loss of their daughter. Living in a highly segregated community, they suffered various forms of humiliation, exclusion and mental torture based on people’s eagerness to abide by what they saw as the divine authority on caste hierarchy. What was written in the 2006 law against caste discrimination and in the 2015 secular constitution of the country didn’t matter at all in the village life!A man having an extramarital affair, or even two wives, wasn’t per se a new or unacceptable thing in their traditional society in Myagdi. Most intolerable for the high-caste family and the entire village was the involvement of a Damai woman—someone considered ritually polluted. She had to be disposed of not because of her personal shortcomings or behaviour but because her marriage would potentially invite the terrible wrath of lineage deities, village gods and goddesses, so much so that those offended spirits could cause death and destruction in the family, the kinship, and the whole village! It was thus deemed a terrible danger to everybody. Perhaps this danger encouraged the suspected culprit and his family to kill both the woman and her foetus. It was probably considered the safest way forward, given that the woman belonged to a typically poor and outcast family. Everything I’ve stated here is no new knowledge. However, I worry about the persistent silence around the issue of religious beliefs perpetuating caste hatred. Just because these religious/spiritual causes don’t count in the legal process doesn’t mean we shouldn’t consider them. If we want to liberate Dalits from oppression in their everyday lives, these common causes shouldn’t be ignored. Mitigation strategiesIt’s time the Nepali parliament and government seriously considered the problem of caste hatred and violence instigated by religious and cultural beliefs—something not exclusive to Hindus anymore. They should support and encourage sociological and anthropological research to examine what’s happening on the ground level and what’s stopping the force of law from influencing people’s lives. It’s also imperative for the Dalit activists to wake up to the fact that caste hate is not just a political and legal matter; it’s also a religious and cultural issue. No law can be effectively employed until it synchronises with popular customs and beliefs. Dalits must stop believing what their political masters tell them and focus more on religious and spiritual causes. This could be based on their own experiences and observations. It’s well-known that many Dalit ministers and MPs have struggled to rent properties around Singha Durbar.The entire Dalit community wants to see the murderer of a pregnant Dalit teenager in Myagdi duly punished. Pursuing justice is crucial, and we should all join hands to ensure that the culprits don’t evade jail.We should be equally mindful that throwing a few criminals in prison hasn’t—will not—per se trigger societal change.

Palesha Goverdhan clinched Nepal’s maiden Olympics-level medal in Paris early on Saturday, sending ripples of excitement and hope across her homeland. Goverdhan seemed destined for success given her stellar track record in international meets over the past few years. Four years ago, Goverdhan, who entered the Tokyo Paralympic Games on a wildcard, had also qualified for the bronze medal final but had lost the bout. Two years later, at the Asian Para Games 2022 in Hangzhou, China, Goverdhan won a medal. She then became the first Nepali paralympian to qualify for the Paralympic Games. And now the 21-year-old has delivered on the biggest stage. After Goverdhan’s victory, her coach Kabi Raj Negi Lama rightly said that his charge had shattered the assumption that a Nepali could never win an Olympic medal. Yet it had appeared that way only a fortnight ago when none of the seven Nepali athletes who took part in the Paris Summer Olympics could create much of an impact. The usual suspects were blamed for their failure: Nepal’s poor sporting infrastructures, paucity of high-level practice, lack of professionalism, etc. Nepal, it seemed, would have to wait for a long time for Olympics success. That was until Goverdhan bagged the taekwondo bronze at the Paris Paralympics. This sends a vital message to other Nepali athletes as well as the Nepali state. One, as coach Lama hinted, Goverdhan’s medal breaks down the psychological barrier that a Nepali cannot succeed at the highest level. There is no inherent reason Nepali athletes or para-athletes cannot make their mark if they get the right kind of state support. Concomitantly, the message that a woman with a disability can capture her country’s attention and bring it international fame is no less important in what is still a patriarchal society. Nepali female athletes are world class, as the country’s women football and cricket teams have repeatedly shown. With a little more impetus, the sky’s the limit of what they can achieve. Goverdhan’s success is also an example of long-term thinking. After her failure to win a medal in Tokyo, Goverdhan pushed herself hard in the following years, and much of the time after that was spent preparing for the next Parlalympics. This suggests that Nepal would do well to start investing for success at Los Angeles 2028 right now as a part of the country’s long term sporting vision. There have of late been some positive gestures from the Nepali state. For instance, this year’s policies and programmes promises fellowships to 1,000 talented youths in various fields, including in sports. There will be special focus on cultivating women athletes. Similarly, various incentives and allowances have also been declared for the Nepali sports stars who achieve international success. There is also a new emphasis on building new stadiums and upgrading existing ones. If all these schemes materialise, greater international sporting success for Nepal will be guaranteed. This is crucial. Nepali youths are desperate for home-grown international idols, whose success inspires and is worthy of emulation. If they see their peers compete and even win against the best in the world, their ambitions will soar. This in turn will boost the morale of their country. As we have repeatedly seen, international sporting success is a glue that binds this diverse country closer. The more, the merrier.  ","summary":"The 60-year-old jinx has finally been broken.

Goverdhan’s success is also an example of long-term thinking. After her failure to win a medal in Tokyo, Goverdhan pushed herself hard in the following years, and much of the time after that was spent preparing for the next Parlalympics. This suggests that Nepal would do well to start investing for success at Los Angeles 2028 right now as a part of the country’s long term sporting vision. There have of late been some positive gestures from the Nepali state. For instance, this year’s policies and programmes promises fellowships to 1,000 talented youths in various fields, including in sports. There will be special focus on cultivating women athletes. Similarly, various incentives and allowances have also been declared for the Nepali sports stars who achieve international success. There is also a new emphasis on building new stadiums and upgrading existing ones. If all these schemes materialise, greater international sporting success for Nepal will be guaranteed. This is crucial. Nepali youths are desperate for home-grown international idols, whose success inspires and is worthy of emulation. If they see their peers compete and even win against the best in the world, their ambitions will soar. This in turn will boost the morale of their country. As we have repeatedly seen, international sporting success is a glue that binds this diverse country closer. The more, the merrier.  "},{"hash":"e7d31f9d175873f41b89150b42ab35080ea11b6c5ac47f945170ef7de7c8c0e7","title":"battle-cry-from-kolkata","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/08/29/battle-cry-from-kolkata","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/Untitled131724144421-1724942018.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1724889600000,"source":"kp","category":"editorial","content":"On August 9, when India was celebrating its beloved athlete Neeraj Chopra’s silver medal in the men’s javelin final in Paris, a harrowing incident took place in Kolkata’s RG Kar Medical College that would traumatise the nation and ignite widespread outcry. A trainee doctor was brutally raped and murdered while resting in a seminar room after completing a 36-hour shift at the hospital. Tens of thousands of people in India’s major cities have taken to the streets, demanding justice and prompt investigation. The event has stirred anger in India, especially among women, highlighting the discourse on women’s safety and the challenges faced by female medical professionals. The RG Kar Medical College incident should ring alarm bells all over South Asia as it is a reminder of how women in the region are unsafe regardless of who they are, what they do or where they go. It also reminds us of the precarious situation of women’s safety in Nepal, where rape cases and violations of women’s rights in general are on the up. The Informal Sector Service Centre (INSEC) published the Nepal Human Rights Year Book 2023, which documented 4,228 victims of women’s rights violations in Nepal in 2022. The report documents 605 incidents of rape, 145 cases of attempted rape and 42 incidents of sexual abuse. In 2021, there were only 3,417 such victims, up from 2,606 in 2020.Last week, police detained six people in Arjundhara of Jhapa district for gang-raping a 16-year-old girl. Cases of minor girls and women being raped in schools, workplaces, chhaugoths, homes and other places by men make headlines every now and then in Nepal. We have become habituated to seeing them, and only when the severity is extreme or an influential person is involved do we speak out in the media or on the streets.

The highly publicised Nirmala Pant rape-and-murder remains unresolved, with no arrests till now. During the decade-long insurgency, many women were raped and brutally assaulted. Some were accused of being Maoists and repeatedly raped in captivity. Nearly two decades since the guns fell silent, these victims are yet to get justice. These cases reflect the extent of impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators of such crimes.The recurring rape cases point to a broader problem of patriarchal violence and social conditioning. In Nepal, this is reflected in the legal framework that is more protective of the accused than the victim. In 2022, when people protested to remove the statute of limitations on rape, which was previously only one year, the National Assembly ratified new amendments increasing the time limit by a few years. Adults could now file a lawsuit within two years of the incident, and minors could initiate legal proceedings within three years of the victims turning 18. These time limits for seeking justice do not justify crimes as horrendous as rape that are unconstitutional and against the principles of fundamental rights.

Yes, we need solid legal frameworks to protect the victims.

Political parties displayed exemplary unity in the course of endorsing the bill, which was promptly welcomed by the international community. If this undertaking succeeds, the remaining tasks of Nepal’s nearly two-decade-long peace process will be completed. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert and former lawmaker Radheshyam Adhikari of Nepali Congress, who has over the years been closely involved in Nepal’s transitional justice process.As a legal expert, how do you see the latest amendment in the transitional justice Act?Looking at it from a legal perspective, the Supreme Court’s order given in this context is the major basis. The amendment has complied with over 95 percent of the top court’s directives. There is one more context we can refer to. The government in 2018 had prepared a ‘zero draft’ on this issue. The international community had expressed their reservations on certain provisions. Most of the contents of that draft have been retained while addressing those reservations. There are some major improvements. The amendment has taken a more liberal approach to victims’ rights. For instance, the draft had only said that the victims would be consulted for reconciliation but the latest amendment made victims’ consent mandatory. If a victim doesn’t want to give consent, he or she can go to court. This is a major change. Likewise, the draft had said the verdict of the to-be-formed Special Court [with a mandate to hear and decide the transitional justice related cases] would be final. But the amendment has allowed the dissatisfied side to appeal in the Supreme Court. There is a plan for a separate fund to carry out transitional justice related tasks so as to ensure fiscal autonomy for the two transitional justice commissions. This process needs fiscal as well as administrative autonomy. You just mentioned that the new Act has complied with 95 percent of the top court’s directives. Could you elaborate on the remaining five percent?I meant to say that the amendment is closer to the court’s directives. I can’t say it is 100 percent because even they [the Supreme Court justices] at the time said ‘so and so’ should be done on a hypothetical ground as so many things were still evolving. Now, some issues might have become redundant. But most of the things have been addressed. See, first, we should have conceptual clarity. There is a fundamental difference between retributive justice and transitional justice systems. In retributive justice, cases are decided by regular courts based on existing laws while in the transitional justice system we have to look into political, social as well as cultural aspects. This is the internationally accepted approach.The amendment has included a provision of up to 75 percent reduced sentencing. The attorney general, who works for the government, is mandated to recommend this. Isn’t this akin to directing the court? Wouldn’t it instead be prudent to leave that to the court? If that were not done, there would be mistrust and the process may not have gotten sufficient support from the warring sides of the past. In such a scenario, the process may have again failed. A supportive role of the stakeholders will be crucial. Of late, I often urge the victims to cooperate with the process; otherwise it will remain a never-ending process. It’s already too late. So, now we should be pragmatic. We should carry out things on a priority basis. Finding and respecting truth are the first and second priorities. The option to go to court is there, if someone wants so. The fourth priority is reparation. The goal is to establish that no one will need to take up arms and resort to violence in Nepal again. Now, most of the stakeholders are positive about concluding this process. The international community has in fact asked us what type of support we need.It is said the role of Desmond Tutu, who led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, was crucial for the success of the country’s transitional justice process. Do you think the personality of the heads of the commissions will be vital in our case as well?Leadership definitely matters. In Colombia as well, a person of similar stature, who is respected by all sides in the country, led the process. So, the leadership and composition of the commissions will matter. The commissions should be allowed to work and make decisions on their own.There are nearly 64,000 complaints with the TRC and around 2,400 with the CIEDP. How should the commissions carry out their task? Will they deal with each and every case individually? What are international practices and what is a broader conceptual understanding in our case?It is too early to talk about the working modality but I believe most cases should be dealt with in a representative way. But cases of serious rights violations will enter the prosecution stage. Producing sufficient evidence to prove the crimes, however, will be challenging. For instance, some rape victims may not be able to name the perpetrators. They were raped but couldn’t even recognise the perpetrator. In such a case, the state should respect such victims and provide reparation to them. Some complainants may choose not to continue with the cases. Before determining whether certain cases are serious or not, each file has to be checked at least once. So, the commissions need a large number of investigating officers. Field offices need to be set up based on the number and nature of complaints. What kind of involvement of international agencies may be needed for this process?It will certainly need the involvement of international agencies. Nepal’s peace process is basically home-grown but we will also seek support and expertise from international agencies, as we did in the past. We never work in isolation but the areas where we need their support will be decided only after the commissions start their work. We need international experts for certain specialised tasks, such as conducting DNA tests and exhuming bodies buried during the insurgency. The way the international community promptly welcomed the new amendment, it seems that the government and political parties were working in close consultation with them. Is that so?As far as I am informed, everything was done by Nepalis. But there was communication with the international agencies. They had earlier expressed their concerns on the ‘zero draft’ and the issues have been addressed. Therefore, they promptly welcomed it. They obviously are involved indirectly because it is a matter the international community is closely watching. But now we may need their direct support to carry out certain specialised tasks.Why didn’t the amendment even mention the use of child soldiers, crime against humanity and war crime?It is a matter of serious consideration as to whether our cases fall under the definition of serious crimes such as crime against humanity. The commissions will study this aspect as well.Don’t you think the provision of reduced sentencing and overlooking of certain legal aspects may promote impunity?Even now, inmates get a waiver of around 50 percent under the regular legal system. So the provision to reduce sentences is already there.But such sentences are reduced only after serving for a certain time and demonstrating good behaviour. Shouldn’t we have adopted a similar approach in this case?Transitional justice system should be seen a bit differently. Here, I give you an example. In Colombia, the TRC of the country summoned the seven secretariat members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). They were first briefed about the charges registered against them. They admitted that they committed the crimes. Then, all of them were acquitted because they spoke the truth. The TRC in Colombia gave priority to finding the truth. If someone showed honesty and cooperated in finding the truth they wouldn’t be punished. But they increased the penalty for those who tried to mislead them through falsehood.Can we say our process is a bit driven by a reparative approach?I again stress that we should look at the transitional justice process differently than how we look at the retributive justice system. It needs a different law, different court and a different jurisprudence.It takes years of rigorous work to complete this process and firm commitment of major political forces is vital. Frequent changes in coalition and unpredictable relations between the political forces is our reality. Don’t you think such instability may hamper this process?This time around, the role of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is very positive. Chiefs of the three biggest parties, while addressing a parliament meeting, have expressed their commitment to make this process successful. Their unity on this matter is important. Not only them, all the political parties represented in the federal parliament, except one lawmaker from a fringe party, have supported this amendment. It has thus become a national issue. I hope this consensus will remain intact while picking officials for the commissions and taking the entire process to a logical end.Given your expertise and involvement in this process, you are being seen as a strong candidate for the TRC chair. What is the reality?I have nothing to say as no one has talked to me about this.

Thousands of people lose their lives in road crashes every year across the country. What are the factors causing these disasters? Why have the authorities failed to prevent them? The Post's Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former secretary Arjun Jung Thapa, who was director general at the Department of Roads for years, to discuss the pressing issue.Why are road accidents taking place so frequently in Nepal? There is no one reason for road accidents. On the infrastructure front, factors like design, condition and geometry of a road are crucial. Putting sign boards along the roads and giving vital information about the particular location is necessary. Those signs should be placed properly so all driving vehicles and passengers can see them clearly. Some technical aspects, such as whether the superelevation is properly designed, particularly at sharp bends, matter greatly. These must be regularly monitored and corrected in time. Regular vehicle fitness tests are essential. Experienced and disciplined drivers are equally important to ensure road safety. Some accidents occur when drivers are unfamiliar with the roads. For instance, the accident that took place at Anbukhaireni of Tanahun district on Friday, killing 27 Indian nationals, might have been because of the driver’s lack of familiarity with the road condition. Yet another serious concern is the lack of road discipline. Those who come to Nepal with years-long experience of driving abroad fear driving because of motorists' reckless driving and lack of lane discipline. The recent accident at Jadibuti, killing one scooter rider, could have been avoided if proper lane discipline had been followed. Reckless driving by motorcyclists has remained a big problem in our case. So, a separate lane should be designated for bikers. Similarly, lanes should be designated for vehicles based on their speed. But such rules are never followed seriously in our case. Traffic police have been entrusted with enforcing traffic rules but lack the human resources to enforce them effectively. We need an integrated and centrally controlled digital traffic light management system. We had experimented with a system as a trial for some time after 2015. We called a bid but couldn’t accept anyone as the bidders proposed more than the rate we had fixed. The project collapsed, and that system could never be revived. We badly lack technology in this sector. When we try to import technology, brokers get involved and ruin the entire process. The condition of roads built haphazardly, mainly in the hills, is another major concern. What do you say about that?We have built around 80,000 kilometres of road across the country. Of that, only around 14,000 kilometres fall under the jurisdiction of the road department. The rest of the road sections fall under the jurisdiction of various authorities, such as the Department of Local Infrastructure and provincial and local governments. The busiest roads are those under the Department of Roads. They are highways and regional roads. Only 50 percent of the roads overseen by the Department of Roads are blacktopped and are not maintained properly. Of the remaining 65,000 kilometres of road, only 4,000 kilometres are blacktopped. This means that the road condition across the country is poor and must be upgraded. The government will now develop the Kakarvitta-Gorusinghe section of the East-West Highway as a safe demonstration corridor. There will be proper infrastructure for crossings, grade-separated intersections, controlled entries, fencing for the safety from wild animals and crossings for wildlife. Local vehicles will run on service lanes. If it is developed as planned, it would be on par with Asian standards. Other roads in the pipeline will follow these standards. These criteria are being implemented while upgrading the Nagdhunga-Mugling road section as well. We have miles to go to upgrade our roads to international standards. Why are we failing to make quality roads?We can’t build our roads according to the original design. At times, locals obstruct road construction and force us to change the alignments. Then, we have to build them based on the availability of the land.Are our rural roads fit from the engineering perspective?Around 35,000 kilometers out of the 65,000 kilometers of roads that don’t fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Roads are built randomly. Local leaders, influential individuals, and bulldozer operators fix the alignments of such roads.How can we rectify the malpractices in this sector?We need to activate the National Road Safety Council urgently. Officials from all the concerned departments and representatives from various stakeholders should sit together in this body and find solutions. Also, coordination has become more complicated in the federal system. For instance, highways are under federal jurisdiction, transport management on highways falls under provincial authority, while road management is under federal jurisdiction. Therefore, an effective coordinating body has become a must. Otherwise, we can’t control the increasing trend of deaths in road accidents. At least 1,700 people lost their lives in 2013, and the then government set a target to reduce it by at least 50 percent by 2020. Instead, the yearly death toll has crossed 2,800 now.While it takes years to complete road upgrading tasks, construction materials are left unmanaged and scattered, making driving along the road very difficult and dangerous. Can’t such things be improved?Contractors are powerful because of their political connection with influential leaders including prime ministers and ministers. Civil servants can’t be assertive when the contractors get political protection. At times, they try to use force to coerce government officials. If the situation is not going in their favour, they provoke locals with a plan to get extension in their contract citing local unrest. Experts say that the government is also to blame as it doesn’t carry out development projects properly. Do you agree?I worked for three decades in government agencies until a few months ago. What I found is that one government devises specific policies, plans and initiates certain projects but successive governments stop them. The new leadership starts its own plans and projects. Then, the contractors don’t get their payment. This is the other side of the story. Another problem is that our ministers, lawmakers and leaders show interest in the projects that deserve the least priority while important projects don’t get attention. For instance, around 30 kilometers of Arniko Highway, which connects Nepal with China, has been badly damaged. This is a very important road for the country. Can’t the government repair and maintain a 30-kilometer section of a highway? It requires just around Rs3 billion whereas leaders have allocated over Rs11.5 billion in the projects of personal interests of leaders. Around Rs4 billion has been allocated under lawmakers’ constituency development programmes and additional Rs5 billion has been earmarked for local bridges. We have allocated around Rs60 billion for non-important projects but we have ignored a crucial road, Arniko Highway, which was built with the support of our neighbour China in the 1960s. Thus we have given unnecessary importance where it doesn’t deserve while ignoring vital development projects. The road accidents are directly or indirectly linked to the government’s wrong policies and plans.Development projects are sometimes said to have failed due to rivalry between some leaders. Do you have any such experience?I will give you an example. In the Biratnagar-Bathnaha cross-border rail project, we had to build over 13 kilometers of the railway. It was around four to five years ago. We cleared over 11 kilometers but locals protested in the remaining section where a station was planned. The locals obstructed work there even as 85 percent of the money for land acquisition had already been distributed. Later, we found that the then minister Aman Lal Modi had provoked the locals to demand for additional money. He demanded a ‘special rate for his men’. But the laws don’t allow it.Some experts argue that to upgrade the quality of our roads, we need to make this sector competitive and, for that, we have to allow the private sector to develop projects. Is it viable?The government is hindering the private sector from entering into this business. They don’t invest without assured returns. They need roads like Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway. The government called for proposals in the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model for this project. They were interested. But the government simultaneously allowed a company to build the Kathmandu-Tunnel Road in the same area. Then the investors felt a risk to invest there. But, the company couldn’t continue the tunnel project. Private sector should be welcomed in this sector but we should create a conducive environment for that. Bangladesh and India have built infrastructure projects under the BOT model. We can do it as well.What do you think about the jurisdictional dispute over the New Road stretch between the Kathmandu Metropolis and the Department of Roads? Who should maintain this road?All the roads within the metropolis fall under the local government’s jurisdiction, as the constitution clearly states. The federal department is managing the roads with the understanding that the local governments are not efficient at maintaining them for now. If a local unit wants to maintain a certain road section on its own, the department should allow it without any dispute. Both sides showed childish behaviour while handling the New Road case. ","summary":"Lately, road accidents are taking place almost every day. Thousands of people lose their lives in road crashes every year across the country. What are the factors causing these disasters? Why have the authorities failed to prevent them? The Post's Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former secretary Arjun Jung Thapa, who was director general at the Department of Roads for years, to discuss the pressing issue.Why are road accidents taking place so frequently in Nepal? There is no one reason for road accidents. On the infrastructure front, factors like design, condition and geometry of a road are crucial. Putting sign boards along the roads and giving vital information about the particular location is necessary. Those signs should be placed properly so all driving vehicles and passengers can see them clearly. Some technical aspects, such as whether the superelevation is properly designed, particularly at sharp bends, matter greatly. These must be regularly monitored and corrected in time. Regular vehicle fitness tests are essential. Experienced and disciplined drivers are equally important to ensure road safety. Some accidents occur when drivers are unfamiliar with the roads. For instance, the accident that took place at Anbukhaireni of Tanahun district on Friday, killing 27 Indian nationals, might have been because of the driver’s lack of familiarity with the road condition. Yet another serious concern is the lack of road discipline. Those who come to Nepal with years-long experience of driving abroad fear driving because of motorists' reckless driving and lack of lane discipline. The recent accident at Jadibuti, killing one scooter rider, could have been avoided if proper lane discipline had been followed. Reckless driving by motorcyclists has remained a big problem in our case. So, a separate lane should be designated for bikers. Similarly, lanes should be designated for vehicles based on their speed. But such rules are never followed seriously in our case. Traffic police have been entrusted with enforcing traffic rules but lack the human resources to enforce them effectively. We need an integrated and centrally controlled digital traffic light management system. We had experimented with a system as a trial for some time after 2015. We called a bid but couldn’t accept anyone as the bidders proposed more than the rate we had fixed. The project collapsed, and that system could never be revived. We badly lack technology in this sector. When we try to import technology, brokers get involved and ruin the entire process. The condition of roads built haphazardly, mainly in the hills, is another major concern. What do you say about that?We have built around 80,000 kilometres of road across the country. Of that, only around 14,000 kilometres fall under the jurisdiction of the road department. The rest of the road sections fall under the jurisdiction of various authorities, such as the Department of Local Infrastructure and provincial and local governments. The busiest roads are those under the Department of Roads. They are highways and regional roads. Only 50 percent of the roads overseen by the Department of Roads are blacktopped and are not maintained properly. Of the remaining 65,000 kilometres of road, only 4,000 kilometres are blacktopped. This means that the road condition across the country is poor and must be upgraded. The government will now develop the Kakarvitta-Gorusinghe section of the East-West Highway as a safe demonstration corridor. There will be proper infrastructure for crossings, grade-separated intersections, controlled entries, fencing for the safety from wild animals and crossings for wildlife. Local vehicles will run on service lanes. If it is developed as planned, it would be on par with Asian standards. Other roads in the pipeline will follow these standards. These criteria are being implemented while upgrading the Nagdhunga-Mugling road section as well. We have miles to go to upgrade our roads to international standards. Why are we failing to make quality roads?We can’t build our roads according to the original design. At times, locals obstruct road construction and force us to change the alignments. Then, we have to build them based on the availability of the land.Are our rural roads fit from the engineering perspective?Around 35,000 kilometers out of the 65,000 kilometers of roads that don’t fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Roads are built randomly. Local leaders, influential individuals, and bulldozer operators fix the alignments of such roads.How can we rectify the malpractices in this sector?We need to activate the National Road Safety Council urgently. Officials from all the concerned departments and representatives from various stakeholders should sit together in this body and find solutions. Also, coordination has become more complicated in the federal system. For instance, highways are under federal jurisdiction, transport management on highways falls under provincial authority, while road management is under federal jurisdiction. Therefore, an effective coordinating body has become a must. Otherwise, we can’t control the increasing trend of deaths in road accidents. At least 1,700 people lost their lives in 2013, and the then government set a target to reduce it by at least 50 percent by 2020. Instead, the yearly death toll has crossed 2,800 now.While it takes years to complete road upgrading tasks, construction materials are left unmanaged and scattered, making driving along the road very difficult and dangerous. Can’t such things be improved?Contractors are powerful because of their political connection with influential leaders including prime ministers and ministers. Civil servants can’t be assertive when the contractors get political protection. At times, they try to use force to coerce government officials. If the situation is not going in their favour, they provoke locals with a plan to get extension in their contract citing local unrest. Experts say that the government is also to blame as it doesn’t carry out development projects properly. Do you agree?I worked for three decades in government agencies until a few months ago. What I found is that one government devises specific policies, plans and initiates certain projects but successive governments stop them. The new leadership starts its own plans and projects. Then, the contractors don’t get their payment. This is the other side of the story. Another problem is that our ministers, lawmakers and leaders show interest in the projects that deserve the least priority while important projects don’t get attention. For instance, around 30 kilometers of Arniko Highway, which connects Nepal with China, has been badly damaged. This is a very important road for the country. Can’t the government repair and maintain a 30-kilometer section of a highway? It requires just around Rs3 billion whereas leaders have allocated over Rs11.5 billion in the projects of personal interests of leaders. Around Rs4 billion has been allocated under lawmakers’ constituency development programmes and additional Rs5 billion has been earmarked for local bridges. We have allocated around Rs60 billion for non-important projects but we have ignored a crucial road, Arniko Highway, which was built with the support of our neighbour China in the 1960s. Thus we have given unnecessary importance where it doesn’t deserve while ignoring vital development projects.

Three years on, she is now the most vocal leader calling for a unification of the two parties. Why didn’t the new party perform well, and what made her lobby for a party merger? Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat with former minister Jhakri for more insights.You worked actively to form the CPN (Unified Socialist), but the party couldn’t perform well. It couldn’t even become a national party from the general elections. What went wrong?We formed the CPN (Unified Socialist) out of compulsion. When Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli—who was prime minister at the time as well—dissolved the House of Representatives in December 2020, we firmly stood against his move, saying that it sowed the seeds of political instability. We staged huge protests and moved the Supreme Court against the decision of Oli, our party chair at the time. I was among the petitioners. Once the top court reinstated the House, we expected the party to move smoothly. Unfortunately, that couldn’t happen. The party establishment led by Oli and the rival faction took extreme actions against each other. The agitating faction announced action against the party chair, and the party establishment expelled us from the party itself. When Oli dissolved the House a second time, we protested the move as it brought instability. We were in favour of transforming the party through intra-party struggle, but the situation took some unexpected turns. We didn’t quit the party with a lofty plan of making a new revolutionary organisation. We were compelled to do so.Our new party accommodated many genuine leaders who had been sidelined in the UML. But ultimately, old leaders heavily dominated the new party’s central committee. They were active leaders of their time but were out of touch with the new, changing context. Young leaders didn’t get space in party committees. I proposed recruiting at least 40 percent members under 40 years in the central committee and over 50 percent members under 30 years in the district committees. I made a 29-year-old leader the chair of the district committee in my home district. In 42 days, I attended 36 district conventions where youths in their 30s were elected district committee chairs. I tried to reach out to municipalities to promote youths in the party chapters. But at the central level, old faces dominated party committees. That didn’t attract people to the party or impress the general public. Thus, it failed to gather steam right from the beginning.Many think that Madhav Kumar Nepal’s selection as party chief was a wrong move since he had led the UML for 15 years and become prime minister, and people didn’t find novelty in the new party. Do you think so too?Madhav Kumar Nepal has been the most active leader in the party since its inception. Whatever the party has achieved so far is because of him. But a party leader must mobilise teams with defined roles and responsibilities and continuously motivate and engage them in result-oriented tasks. He works a lot but doesn’t mobilise teams effectively. Observers say the Unified Socialist was formed due to the personality clash between top leaders and that it lacked a national agenda and a clear policy to prove the need for a new party. Do you feel so?Our immediate agenda was safeguarding the constitution and ensuring political stability in the country. We protested the House dissolution guided by the same policy. But when provincial governments were made like satellites of the federal government, we couldn’t play any role in stabilising them.The UML is guided by the policy of People’s Multiparty Democracy, propounded by the late Madan Bhandari. There was a debate on further enhancing the policy in the changed context. A large section of Left intellectuals were interested in contributing to that. We could have engaged them in the process. But our party stopped the debate on that topic as well. We missed the chance of engaging many critical individuals in the discourse and having a relatively different policy. When in the UML, we practised direct elections of party representatives and leaders from the conventions. Unfortunately, leaders of the new party, Unified Socialist, made a statute that gave powers to the party leadership to nominate party secretariat, office bearers and other members. Leaders would pick those who are loyal to them. This regressive approach killed competition in the party.You are known to prefer a more proactive work and decision-making approach. There are rumours that you have been fed up with the party’s lacklustre style and are mulling to join the mother party, UML.If I were to decide only from a personal perspective, I would have done so much earlier because I had multiple opportunities in the past. But I am for party merger because I don’t see any relevance of running multiple retail shops under communist banners because we are not substantially different from each other in terms of policies. Our electoral system has also made it necessary. The Unified Socialist can’t run like this. We must accept reality and decide—merging our party with the UML is better than running it this way. But it seems that the top leaders of the twin parties are still bitter about each other.True, the bitterness lingers on, mainly among the top leaders. We have also made some mistakes. The UML offered some opportunities to the Unified Socialist, and we should have made some offers to capitalise on the favourable situation. At one time, UML leaders proposed our party chair as a candidate for the vacant post of the country’s President. We should have devised our own proposal and made a win-win deal. But we ran away and squandered the opportunity. If Madhav Kumar Nepal had become president on the UML’s proposal, our party might have been reunited with the UML much earlier. I also took an initiative to that end but in vain. Later also, UML chair Oli visited our party chair’s residence to have our party on board the government. But the reaction from our side ruined things. We are certainly not responding to the UML responsibly. Rather than irritate the UML, we must turn each positive gesture into an opportunity for party unity.One more factor is blocking the unity between the two parties. There are a large number of second-rung leaders in the UML who can’t directly confront Oli. They are now encouraging former President Bidya Devi Bhandari to join active politics and trying to make decisions in their favour through her. Oli knows these leaders will support Nepal when he returns to the UML. Why would he [Oli] then merge the fringe party and create another power centre against himself? He knows Madhav Kumar Nepal will challenge him with the backing of the dissidents. It is natural for a leader to think twice before allowing another leader of your stature to create a parallel power centre within the organisation. Even I would have thought twice. This is a major factor hindering party unity.Your party chair and other key leaders seem quite close to CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and critical of UML chair Oli. Moreover, Oli often lambasts Madhav Kumar Nepal publicly. Will they still merge the parties?In principle, our party is open for unity with any Left party. But party cadres won’t join the Maoist Centre. If our leadership decides to merge the party with the Maoists, a huge number of our party cadres will join the UML. Unity between the UML and the Unified Socialist is natural because we grew up in the same background and orientation. But we are quite different from Maoists. Several groups trying to form new political outfits have failed to emerge as a major political force and sustain themselves. You worked in a big party for years and also helped establish a new one. What are the challenges of forming a new political organisation in Nepal?Political parties sustain if they evolve with society. If you trace the history of the Nepal’s Congress and communist parties, you will see how they have evolved over the past seven decades. They competed against each other but joined hands to fight autocratic forces towards establishing democracy. They have done hundreds of progressive things in society. Their major fault is that they have multiple entry points but no exit policy. The only exit way is the death of the leaders. This has caused unhealthy practices and created dissident groups.The dissidents who didn’t get any space within their party formed new outfits. They also amplified negative narratives against the old parties. It happened with the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre. Had there been an exit system in the party, the situation wouldn’t be this bad. But new political parties can’t sustain without their own political ideology and orientation. You may form an organisation, cash in on people’s frustration and achieve some immediate gains, but outfits can’t sustain.But recent electoral trends show that Nepalis are seeking alternative forces and new faces. Can we be oblivious to that?You are right. We have seen such trends in the Panchayat system as well. But garnering votes during elections for one term and establishing a sustainable political force are two different things.  ","summary":"CPN (Unified Socialist) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri was among the most active leaders involved in the formation of the party after split with the CPN-UML in 2021.

But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly. At the end of the meeting, we will make an objective analysis of the overall situation and prepare an action plan.The Central Committee endorses the decisions. But the meetings of the office bearers and standing committee set the agenda and orientation for the party. What have you decided so far? On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution? Doesn’t that violate the mandate the parties got through the elections? Generally, the constitution might be reviewed after 10 years of its implementation. But we haven’t implemented it in a full-fledged way as we don’t even have all the laws required for its effective implementation. We have just agreed to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. So, the proposal to amend the constitution without first completing the basics required for its implementation is wrong. They want to make changes in the proportional inclusive system of our constitution. A political force can work to secure a majority in the House through general elections and ensure stability in the country. We accept that. We have also been lobbying for a directly elected executive president for political stability. They are not ready to debate on that. But they want to revoke the inclusive system, a major achievement of the 2006 people’s movement. This system has empowered historically excluded and deprived communities. We have to enhance the capacity of these groups instead of depriving them of their rights. If there are anomalies in the system’s implementation, let’s develop methods to more effectively pick our representatives. But the ruling parties seem intent on turning back the clock. Some leaders have publicly announced that they want to end the role of small parties. There can be a number of political parties in a country like Nepal, which is rich in social diversity. We adopted federalism for the same purpose. The leaders give priority to their family members and loyal ones while selecting election candidates and blame the constitution for the ensuing mistakes. They want to rule the country indefinitely through a two-party system. So we think the Congress-UML alliance is on the path of regression. Republicanism, federalism, secularism, inclusion and socialism-oriented systems are integrated five pillars of the present constitution. No attack on them will be tolerated. This is one focus of our ongoing meeting. We are also discussing some fresh international issues such as the developments in Bangladesh. We have yet to get a complete picture from there. But we can still learn some things. The centre of global affairs is changing and shifting to Asia. More importantly, there is a strong influence of such geopolitical forces in Nepal as well.Party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that there was an external hand in the recent change of coalition.External elements are active, in one way or the other. Some want to make our country a playground of external forces but our party and party chair firmly stood against it. The forces that wanted various things but didn’t get them from the government then started searching for a character suitable for them. People aren’t aware of such unseen elements but we should be careful. In the meeting, we are discussing this issue as well.Do you think geopolitics is the major reason for the ouster of the Dahal-led government?In his third term as a prime minister, Prachanda was working with certain priorities such as good governance, social justice and prosperity. He had taken governance seriously. Previously, there was a practice of exploiting state coffers in collusion between politicians, big businessmen and bureaucrats. The Prachanda-led government strongly stood against such a nexus. Actions against those involved in Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Bansbari Leather Shoe land scam, and gold smuggling are some examples. The government formulated a law to address the problems of loan shark victims. But some individuals associated with the coalition partners were involved in the scams. Were these bad elements linked to the Congress or the UML? Dahal entered into coalitions with both.The individuals were linked to partners in both the coalitions. The party chair made good governance his main priority but the Maoist Centre is the third-largest party so his hands were tied. When certain individuals were brought under investigation in corruption cases, the initiatives to change the government were expedited overnight. We can conclude that Prachanda government’s anti-corruption moves inspired other parties to oust it.You mentioned external interference as well as other parties’ fear of the government’s anti-corruption actions. Which one was the major reason for government change?The government’s anti-corruption drive is the main reason behind the formation of the new coalition. This drive brought the two largest parties together to form a government, which is unusual in the parliamentary system. The government is working to increase the threshold to secure seats under the proportional representation category. The proposed provision is against small parties, and the Maoist Centre has opposed this. Do you see the possibility of polarisation among the parties on this issue?When the ruling parties introduce new proposals that were not even discussed during the elections, we will definitely oppose them. We led the previous movements for people’s rights and we have to secure these rights. Thus the polarisation between those who want to trample on the statute and those who are against such attacks is inevitable. Is the Maoist Centre preparing to unify with other parties including the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand Biplab?First, we are in the final stage of merging with the outfit of Mahindra Raya Yadav. Also, the Biplab-led party has endorsed the party unity proposal. We have to iron out some theoretical issues and make the party line clear in the changed national as well as international context. Dialogue between us is headed in the right direction.You earlier said party chair has urged other leaders to openly debate issues. Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on. ","summary":"The CPN (Maoist Centre) has either led or been a part of the government for most of the past decade and half. But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly. At the end of the meeting, we will make an objective analysis of the overall situation and prepare an action plan.The Central Committee endorses the decisions. But the meetings of the office bearers and standing committee set the agenda and orientation for the party. What have you decided so far? On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution? Doesn’t that violate the mandate the parties got through the elections? Generally, the constitution might be reviewed after 10 years of its implementation. But we haven’t implemented it in a full-fledged way as we don’t even have all the laws required for its effective implementation. We have just agreed to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. So, the proposal to amend the constitution without first completing the basics required for its implementation is wrong. They want to make changes in the proportional inclusive system of our constitution. A political force can work to secure a majority in the House through general elections and ensure stability in the country. We accept that. We have also been lobbying for a directly elected executive president for political stability. They are not ready to debate on that. But they want to revoke the inclusive system, a major achievement of the 2006 people’s movement. This system has empowered historically excluded and deprived communities. We have to enhance the capacity of these groups instead of depriving them of their rights. If there are anomalies in the system’s implementation, let’s develop methods to more effectively pick our representatives. But the ruling parties seem intent on turning back the clock. Some leaders have publicly announced that they want to end the role of small parties. There can be a number of political parties in a country like Nepal, which is rich in social diversity. We adopted federalism for the same purpose. The leaders give priority to their family members and loyal ones while selecting election candidates and blame the constitution for the ensuing mistakes. They want to rule the country indefinitely through a two-party system. So we think the Congress-UML alliance is on the path of regression. Republicanism, federalism, secularism, inclusion and socialism-oriented systems are integrated five pillars of the present constitution. No attack on them will be tolerated. This is one focus of our ongoing meeting. We are also discussing some fresh international issues such as the developments in Bangladesh. We have yet to get a complete picture from there. But we can still learn some things. The centre of global affairs is changing and shifting to Asia. More importantly, there is a strong influence of such geopolitical forces in Nepal as well.Party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that there was an external hand in the recent change of coalition.External elements are active, in one way or the other. Some want to make our country a playground of external forces but our party and party chair firmly stood against it. The forces that wanted various things but didn’t get them from the government then started searching for a character suitable for them. People aren’t aware of such unseen elements but we should be careful.

He has studied and written extensively on water resources, trans-boundary water cooperation, flood management, wash services and climate change adaptation, clean energy transition and related policy studies. In this interview with the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal, Dixit discusses river management in Nepal’s urban areas: Where have we gone wrong in this endeavour and what can we do? You have extensively studied river systems and have been following changes seen in river basins. How do you see recent problems caused by encroachment and rampant development activities?We humans have lived and have to continue to live within water cycles: water evaporates from the ocean to the sky and then precipitates to the land and flows via rivers back to the ocean. Rivers that function as arteries of the land surface, sustaining humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems face widespread abuses: pollution, rampant extraction of their bed and banks, fragmentation and degradation. Without rivers, we would not be who we are. Unfortunately, we have forgotten this essence. We neglect and abuse rivers. In 1981, just after the monsoon ended, I, along with my students, walked from Sundarijal to Teku studying Bagmati rivers’ sediment. At many places, we walked on the riverbed. The river then was clean. Gradually, the river systems began to face all-round decay. I have read painful accounts of my contemporaries who remember swimming in the clean Bagmati and its tributaries. In less than 50 years, our rivers in Kathmandu Valley and other basins no longer look like rivers. I feel helpless and ache with pain at this collective failure! What state of rivers are we passing on to our next generation?River encroachment is common across Nepal but more serious in urban areas, including in Kathmandu. How can this be stopped?Our approach to rivers is an imitation of the trend common across South Asia, or the subcontinent, which is again largely based on the knowledge system developed in the industrialised Global North without contextualising locally. The region features waterscapes of high and punctuated rainfall during the monsoon months, rivers, wetlands, ponds, and springs, all connected with groundwater aquifers in one of the most complex landscapes of the world: the Himalaya-Ganga region. Yet, current development endeavours subjugate water rather than respect and live with it. In 2022, the Indus River in Pakistan faced major floods with devastating consequences. Referring to these floods, a group of global scientists stated that “the impacts [of the floods] were the outcome of an outdated river management system.” This approach is primarily based on building of physical structures such as buildings, bridges and roads close to rivers interfering with their natural flows. The approach that began in the early twentieth century keeps marching on even while we are facing twenty first century water challenges.There is an increasing trend of building corridor roads along the rivers in Kathmandu as well as other places. Is this a good or bad practice? In Nepal, road building in the hills has earned the sobriquet of “dozer roads,” meaning politically designed roads excavated by heavy machine operators without adhering to basic engineering, social, environmental, or hydrological safeguards. Even highways built with “engineering,” such as the Mugling-Narayanghat section, face regular accidents. The sliding of the two buses in the Trishuli is the recent example. Building roads along the banks of rivers, defined as “river corridors,” is the preferred approach for improving connectivity. In the Kathmandu Valley, this is also associated with rivers shackled within concrete walls in the name of river beautification. In the monsoon, however, they all overflow as we have been seeing in the last few years and this year as well.What will happen to these rivers 10-15 years down the line? Is there any chance of some of our rivers dying? Or, will the measures taken in recent times protect them?All rivers must flow clean and free in selected stretches. But today, rivers are disconnected with their floodplains. Within walls and embankments, they have become conduits of filth. Many rivers are already seriously degraded. If the current trend continues, many rivers may die. I remember Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, filmmaker, and author, who wrote: “Water and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.” Our current efforts at conserving, developing and managing rivers are grossly inadequate. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw some rivers heal as human actions across the board ceased due to the lockdown. But this healing came at huge human and economic costs. The lessons, however, are clear. We must stop turning rivers into garbage cans for them to begin to heal. The onus lies on us, our activities, our governance, and the policies we make and put into practice effectively. We need new ways of imagining rivers in harmony with human needs. Otherwise, the rivers will die. If rivers die, what will become of us?What problems may city dwellers face as a result of this continued destruction of rivers?A 2020 analysis of rivers in Nepal found that the quality of rivers in the mid-hills and the Tarai are already deteriorating. Industries, cities, towns, and agriculture produce waste that, when disposed of in rivers untreated, cause pollution. Solid and liquid wastes produced by expanding cities and towns pollute nearby rivers, streams, and water bodies. Pollution kills aquatic life such as fish, which are sources of livelihood for many communities. Polluted rivers and water bodies degrade human and environmental health, leading to negative impacts on human livelihoods. The impacts of pollution on rivers are considerable during non-monsoon months when river discharge, and consequently the capacity of rivers to dilute waste, are low.What should be done to conserve the rivers, at least in the present form, and stop further damages?All rivers are a combination of water (W), energy (E), biodiversity aquatic (B), and sediment (S), represented by the acronym WEBS. In the current scheme of things, the focus is on water and energy. Aquatic ecosystems are the concern of only those working on freshwater ecosystems. They are neglected in the larger context though the state has made some provisions for conserving ecosystems. In Nepal’s Hydropower Development Policy of 2001 all hydropower plants must release 10 percent minimum flow to the downstream reaches to enable fish and other aquatic life to survive in the river. A 2021 study of 50 hydropower plants however found that none of the plants surveyed release environmental-flows. All hydropower plants, as per their power purchasing agreements, are required to produce maximum power during the dry season. We should start by accepting the fact that rivers need clean flowing water and respecting the policies we have made. Then we must systematically introduce changes and avoid the oversights embedded in the present approach. The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems. In the present approach, nobody seems to want sediment which is a natural consequence of flow within the water cycle.To meet such an objective, we need to begin with a system of integrated knowledge that synthesises natural science, social science, and indigenous practices. By incorporating fields such as hydrology, ecology, social science-supported context-specific engineering, and indigenous knowledge and practices, we can take a comprehensive approach to water management challenges and solutions. Interdisciplinary approaches can build collaboration, innovation, and systemic decision-making and promote innovative water management for the benefit of both ecosystems and human societies.Do you think initiatives such as river clean up campaigns run by various groups help protect these waterways?I see such initiatives as manifestation of dissatisfaction of concerned citizens with the degradation of rivers and to bring about changes. In 1990, I was part of the Save Bagmati Campaign, which aimed to highlight the degrading state of the river. This campaign has taken many new forms, and citizen groups have begun campaigns in other rivers of Nepal. They however remain fragmented and ad-hoc. Similar campaigns in some countries have led to granting rights to rivers. In 2017, New Zealand recognised the Whanganui River and its tributaries as legal entities, acknowledging their physical and spiritual significance as “living and indivisible” and ensuring their survival, health, and integrity to balance the needs of humans and nature. Promulgations like Living Indus (Pakistan), Namami Gange river-improvement programme (India) can offer lessons for a holistic water journey. The collective voice of concerned citizens for the integrity of rivers can be a powerful medium for policy and pathway changes. Nepal must also begin country-wide river restoration initiatives. We need more dialogue and conversation around water challenges and solutions.As cities turn into concrete jungles, their water tables are said to be receding alarmingly. You often propose redesigning our settlements and development infrastructure in a way that wouldn’t disturb rivers’ natural courses and catchment areas. Could you elaborate?South Asia is a region of waterscapes containing streams, ponds, wetlands, open spaces, floodplains, springs, and underground aquifers. Yet, our towns, cities, and infrastructure are planned, designed, and built to disregard water rather than live with it. As land-centric urban growth dominates, waterscapes temporarily seem to vanish but later water comes back. In Nepali we have a saying “In twelve years a stream returns”. The present practice of urban development is obsessed with concretisation, making these areas impermeable. Rainwater, part of which would naturally infiltrate the ground, now immediately reaches the rivers already constrained by walls. The river at a downstream section immediately peaks and when the rainfall stops the river has very low discharge. Basic parameters, like the intensity of rainfall (mm per hour), are poorly recognised and used in design guidelines. The interaction of current urbanisation practices and increasing extreme rainfall, temperature and humidity rise spawned by climate change and urban heat island effects will make our urban areas as crucible of hazards, and unhealthy. A new urban future must harmoniously integrate nature, including water bodies and wetlands, and preserve natural land cover, including traditional ponds to promote groundwater recharge. It can be further achieved by preserving green open spaces, forests, gardens, permeable “sponge” pavements, and natural waterfronts for healthier communities in sustainable cities. The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving rivers’ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey.

The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving rivers’ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey.
