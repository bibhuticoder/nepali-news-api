But the prime minister’s decision to cling on and seek a vote of confidence is set to delay the process of forming a new government, which will be led by UML chairman KP Sharma Oli as per the understanding. On Tuesday, a UML secretariat meeting requested all political parties to join the new government of ‘national consensus’ and contribute to political stability. As per the Congress-UML understanding to form the government under Article 76 (2) of the constitution, the UML meeting also called on the prime minister to pave the way by Wednesday evening.“The meeting endorsed the agreement reached between the Congress and the UML,” Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of the UML, said after the meeting. Contrary to widespread expectations, the UML has decided to delay its earlier plan to immediately recall ministers from the Dahal Cabinet. “We don’t want more animosity [against the Maoist Centre] and so we did not recall our ministers today,” Gyawali said. “But if the prime minister does not pave the way for new government formation by tomorrow [Wednesday] evening, we will recall our ministers and take other necessary steps.”“If the prime minister ignores UML’s request [to quit], our party will withdraw its support to the government.”The party has eight ministers in the Dahal Cabinet. The UML has also given a reason for its decision to sever ties with Dahal. “The prime minister was in talks with the Congress for a month in order to form a national consensus government, which created a situation of mistrust,” said Gyawali. “This ultimately forced us to initiate talks with the Nepali Congress.” After Congress rejected Dahal’s proposal, the UML and Congress started talking seriously to unseat Dahal, according to Gyawali. “The UML and the Congress started talking and decided to move ahead together for political stability and democratic exercise,” he said. The UML meeting also endorsed the understanding with the Congress, expressing hope that a new government would ensure political stability, help mend the crisis-ridden economy, and address growing public frustration. Gyawali said his party had no plans to ditch the current coalition despite some internal issues. “We were prepared to give continuity to the government. But some interesting developments started unfolding in national politics. The prime minister started discussions about forming a national government without consulting anyone, prompting us to question the objective and necessity of such a government,” said Gyawali. He also recounted Dahal’s history of kicking out the UML from the government within just 15 days of government formation last year. “So we became suspicious of the prime minister,” said Gyawali, “But Nepali Congress did not accept the prime minister’s request this time.” As the picture of the new government remains unclear, there is also confusion over Cabinet formation and discussions about power-sharing between the Nepali Congress, UML and other parties. “On Cabinet formation, we have reached a broad understanding with the UML, but we are yet to finalise the names of ministers,” a Congress office bearer told the Post. Besides the UML, the Congress has also separately asked the prime minister to step down. On Monday midnight, Nepali Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba and UML chair Oli also agreed to form a high-powered constitution review committee to suggest amendments to the constitution, bypassing key ruling partners like the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party.Besides the Nepali Congress and the UML, other parties like the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, Janata Samajbadi Party (Upendra Yadav faction) have welcomed the new deal. Deuba, according to one Congress leader, also met CPN (Unified Socialist) chair Madhav Kumar Nepal on Tuesday evening and asked him to join the new political process. Nepal responded that he would discuss the matter in the party. The CPN (Maoist Centre), the Rastriya Swatantra Party, and the CPN (Unified Socialist) have opposed the deal. The RSP, a key party in the government, said that it would remain in the government so long as the prime minister stays in office. After the deal with the Congress, Oli met Prime Minister Dahal on Tuesday morning and asked him to step down, but Dahal refused to do so, according to Maoist Centre leaders. Dahal, after meeting Oli, convened a meeting of the party’s secretariat, where he discussed the latest political situation and updated party leaders on his interactions with Oli and Deuba in the past few days. Devendra Poudel, the Maoist Centre party secretary, said it has been decided that the prime minister will not resign and he will instead seek a vote of confidence in the House.In the meeting, Dahal was reportedly angry with Oli, whom Dahal accused of betraying him. “Deuba showed political culture, but not Oli,” Dahal said in the meeting. “I didn’t expect such a move from Oli with whom I had very cordial talks even until Monday afternoon.”“We are not escaping, and we are not afraid,” said Devendra Poudel. “We have decided to deal with the situation politically.”Dahal went to meet President Ram Chandra Poudel on Tuesday and informed the President that he would follow the constitutional course. Dahal advised the President to call for government formation based on Article 76 (3) of the constitution, according to which the leader of the single largest party in the House of Representatives—Deuba in this case—will be called to form a new government. The Maoist Centre has also objected to the understanding between the Congress and the UML on amending the constitution, terming it a ‘regressive’ step. Dahal told the President that he would follow the constitution, which means he will face a no-confidence motion in the House. As per Article 100 of the constitution, the prime minister will have 30 days to seek a vote of confidence.When the decision to withdraw support reaches Parliament, the date for seeking a vote of confidence will be fixed as per parliamentary regulations.“Seeking a vote of confidence is the prerogative of the prime minister and so he is not bound to resign,” said Bipin Adhikari, an expert on constitutional matters. “Tendering resignation is his choice but seeking a vote of confidence within 30 days of a party withdrawing support is his constitutional right.”A senior UML leader told the Post that Oli wants to be the prime minister under Article 76 (2).If no political party commands a majority in the House, the President can call for government formation under Article 76 (2).“In cases where no party has a clear majority in the House of Representatives under clause (1), the President shall appoint as the Prime Minister a member of the House of Representatives who can command a majority with the support of two or more parties representing the House of Representatives,” says the Article.The spirit of this Article is to provide a strong and stable government, said Adhikari, and so the President can call for government formation under this Article.“We are consulting on what to do and exploring legal options in case the prime minister declines to step down or delays the vote of confidence,” a Congress office bearer told the Post.As per the understanding, Oli will lead a new ‘national consensus’ government for a year and a half. For the remaining term of Parliament, Deuba will be the prime minister. Both parties have also tentatively reached a power-sharing deal, including on division of ministerial portfolios, amendments to the constitution, review of the electoral system, including proportional representation, change of national assembly arrangements, and the size of provincial assemblies, according to the understanding reached between the two sides.As per the draft understanding, the Congress will lead 10 ministries, including home, and the UML nine, including finance. Likewise, the Congress and the UML will lead three provincial governments each, with the government in Madhesh to be led by a regional party.  ","summary":"A day after the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML sealed a deal to form a new political alliance and decided to amend some provisions of the constitution, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who was largely left out of the new power-sharing process, has refused to step down from the post.The political fraternity has been divided over the new understanding between the Nepali Congress and the UML.

Although the leaders of both the parties said they have agreed to amend the constitution, the agreement document is reportedly silent on it. “Leaders of two parties have agreed in principle to amend the constitution, but the amendment has not been included in the power-sharing agreement,” a Congress leader who is closely associated with the latest political developments told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “We are still discussing how to make changes to the constitution.” Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba informed his party leaders during a meeting on Tuesday morning that they have decided to amend the constitution, as per the party insider.The midnight deal between the Congress and the UML on Monday, however, has decided that UML chair KP Sharma Oli will lead the government for the first half of the remaining term of Parliament. “On Monday, the two parties essentially agreed on three major points,” a UML leader closely involved in the political developments told the Post. “To form a stable government, to address the country’s economic crisis, and new government leadership.” The UML leader also confirmed that there is no written agreement on amending the constitution. However, he claimed that the constitution amendment will happen in due course after the formation of the Congress-UML government.UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel also claimed that the new Congress-UML government plans to amend the constitution to ensure political stability. After the agreement on power-sharing between Congress and UML on Monday night, the general secretary wrote on social media that a ‘national consensus government’ would be formed under Oli’s leadership. “There is an agreement to form a government of national consensus under Oli's leadership to amend the constitution for political stability and draft laws accordingly,” Pokharel wrote.Although they are yet to disclose the proposed amendments, both Congress and UML leaders have been questioning the relevance of the current electoral system. So long as the electoral system (a mix of direct and proportional elections) remains, no single party will secure a majority, therefore, the two parties have decided to change the electoral system, according to leaders of the two parties the Post spoke with. In the UML, there is a strong opinion that for a party to be a national party, the minimum vote threshold should increase from 3 percent to 5 percent of the total valid votes cast under the proportional category, says a UML leader. When it comes to the electoral system, the Congress leaders are not happy with the proportional electoral system.Since the first constituent assembly election in 2008, Nepal has been practising a mixed electoral system in which 60 percent of representatives are elected through direct election, whereas 40 percent are elected through proportional representation. “If we start amending the constitution, the process might not stop at changing the electoral system,” says former Chief Election Commissioner Nilkantha Uprety. He terms the proportional system as a big political achievement and says it should be continued.“We introduced this system to ensure proportional representation of all groups and communities in the country,” Uprety told the Post. “The system is still very relevant in the Nepali context.” Just changing the electoral system does not ensure political stability, Uprety said. “I hope our political parties give serious thought to the things that the country needs to change and the things it needs to keep constant,” he added. “We should avoid going back to a pre-2008 state when there was no proportional representation.”While the two party leaders are planning to amend the constitution to give the country a semblance of stability, a two-thirds majority in both the lower and upper house is needed to amend the charter. This means 184 seats in the 275-strong federal parliament. Not just that. In any matter related to any of the seven provinces, the provincial legislatures must also approve the amendments, again with two-thirds majority. Though the Congress and the UML, largest parties in Parliament with 88 and 78 seats, have joined hands to form the government, they will still need the support of 18 more lawmakers to achieve a two-thirds majority in the lower house. And in the 59-member upper house, the two parties will need the backing of every party except the CPN (Maoist Centre) to secure a two-thirds (40 votes) majority, to amend the constitution. “The constitution amendment will not happen in haste. It is a long process that the Congress-UML government will accomplish in time,” says Gyanendra Bahadur Karki, Congress leader.“If the two largest parties decide to amend the constitution, I believe we will be able to muster the numbers in both the Houses,” Karki told the Post.Meanwhile, the Maoist Centre has seen the agreement between the Congress and UML to amend the constitution with suspicion. A Maoist Centre meeting held at Baluwatar on Tuesday morning interpreted the amendment proposal as the two largest parties questioning the current political system in the name of seeking political stability.“Where will the constitutional amendment lead us?” the secretary of Maoist Centre, Devendra Paudel, asked. “If the constitutional amendment was that necessary, it could also have been done close to the next election cycle.”  ","summary":"The two major parties, the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, reached a written agreement on Monday to form a new government.

With no flights coming in anytime soon, they have again appealed to the federal government to prepare a workable strategy to operate it.A government official at the National Statistics Office recently told the Post that Lumbini Province suffered a recession this year, with most shops shuttered due to low business activity.On Monday, the private sector representatives of Rupandehi, Kapilvastu, and Nawalparasi West appealed to the members of parliament to sketch a business plan to operate the airport and revive Lumbini's economy.Members of a subcommittee formed by the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee to probe the alleged irregularities while constructing the airport are inspecting it.At an interaction on Monday, local stakeholders and private sector representatives said that the airport inaugurated more than two years ago saw a few flights until the end of 2022 but no airline served it again.The participants said that with the airport, built at an investment of nearly Rs40 billion, remaining quiet, billions of private sector investment is at risk. For a long time, the private sector has clamoured for international flights. Industry entrepreneurs, traders, people’s representatives, and civil society leaders demanded the government do something about it.“The government should realise that there are areas outside Kathmandu also that need its attention,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry.He questioned the subcommittee’s intent.“If they [parliamentary members] have come here aiming to operate the airport, there is a need for a policy-level decision to make the new airport viable.”Yogesh Bhattarai, coordinator of the subcommittee, and eight members of the Public Accounts Committee reached the airport for inspection. During the discussion, the lawmakers admitted the government's lapses and lack of seriousness about operating the new airport, which has pushed private investments to the brink.“We have been in serious trouble,” Shrestha said.“The government has not even discussed the new airport with ambassadors from various countries. Besides, people have to visit Kathmandu to get labour permits. If all works are performed from the Capital, how can the new airport operate,” Shrestha said.Chandra Prakash Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Hotel Association, said that the government has already spent more than Rs40 billion for the construction of the airport.The private sector has already invested Rs80 billion in hotels and restaurants, hoping that the airport's operation will increase the number of tourists.“The entrepreneurs who took loans from banks are in trouble. The situation is getting worse day by day,” Shrestha said. “Despite the pressure from the private sector for a long time, the government has done nothing.”Shrestha said that to start international flights, the Kathmandu-centric activities need to be decentralised. “We are pressuring it continuously, but the government does not listen.”Bishnu Paudel, former finance minister, said resuming international flights from Bhairahawa was missing from the government's agenda. “It is off the government’s working list to operate the airport. That is why there are no flights.”Paudel said the government has not invited international airlines to fly from the airport. “If the airport does not come into operation, it will feed a bad development narrative.”Paudel said the airport needs to be operated at full capacity in an organised way. Essential preparations should have started as soon as construction began, but it is already too late now.Bhattarai said that tourism entrepreneurs, industry entrepreneurs, and civil society feel that the airport needs to be operational without further delay. “We have collected the feedback, and the subcommittee will suggest that the government create a conducive environment for international flights.”“We are taking information regarding the investment, its need and design and construction, including the government’s investment and operation plan,” Bhattarai said.On Monday morning, the subcommittee discussed the matter with the chief of airport management, immigration, customs, and airport security agency.“We have asked the airport management many questions. Some have been answered, some have not,” said Bhattarai.

With no flights coming in anytime soon, they have again appealed to the federal government to prepare a workable strategy to operate it.A government official at the National Statistics Office recently told the Post that Lumbini Province suffered a recession this year, with most shops shuttered due to low business activity.On Monday, the private sector representatives of Rupandehi, Kapilvastu, and Nawalparasi West appealed to the members of parliament to sketch a business plan to operate the airport and revive Lumbini's economy.Members of a subcommittee formed by the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee to probe the alleged irregularities while constructing the airport are inspecting it.At an interaction on Monday, local stakeholders and private sector representatives said that the airport inaugurated more than two years ago saw a few flights until the end of 2022 but no airline served it again.The participants said that with the airport, built at an investment of nearly Rs40 billion, remaining quiet, billions of private sector investment is at risk. For a long time, the private sector has clamoured for international flights. Industry entrepreneurs, traders, people’s representatives, and civil society leaders demanded the government do something about it.“The government should realise that there are areas outside Kathmandu also that need its attention,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry.He questioned the subcommittee’s intent.“If they [parliamentary members] have come here aiming to operate the airport, there is a need for a policy-level decision to make the new airport viable.”Yogesh Bhattarai, coordinator of the subcommittee, and eight members of the Public Accounts Committee reached the airport for inspection. During the discussion, the lawmakers admitted the government's lapses and lack of seriousness about operating the new airport, which has pushed private investments to the brink.“We have been in serious trouble,” Shrestha said.“The government has not even discussed the new airport with ambassadors from various countries. Besides, people have to visit Kathmandu to get labour permits. If all works are performed from the Capital, how can the new airport operate,” Shrestha said.Chandra Prakash Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Hotel Association, said that the government has already spent more than Rs40 billion for the construction of the airport.The private sector has already invested Rs80 billion in hotels and restaurants, hoping that the airport's operation will increase the number of tourists.“The entrepreneurs who took loans from banks are in trouble. The situation is getting worse day by day,” Shrestha said. “Despite the pressure from the private sector for a long time, the government has done nothing.”Shrestha said that to start international flights, the Kathmandu-centric activities need to be decentralised. “We are pressuring it continuously, but the government does not listen.”Bishnu Paudel, former finance minister, said resuming international flights from Bhairahawa was missing from the government's agenda. “It is off the government’s working list to operate the airport. That is why there are no flights.”Paudel said the government has not invited international airlines to fly from the airport. “If the airport does not come into operation, it will feed a bad development narrative.”Paudel said the airport needs to be operated at full capacity in an organised way. Essential preparations should have started as soon as construction began, but it is already too late now.Bhattarai said that tourism entrepreneurs, industry entrepreneurs, and civil society feel that the airport needs to be operational without further delay. “We have collected the feedback, and the subcommittee will suggest that the government create a conducive environment for international flights.”“We are taking information regarding the investment, its need and design and construction, including the government’s investment and operation plan,” Bhattarai said.On Monday morning, the subcommittee discussed the matter with the chief of airport management, immigration, customs, and airport security agency.“We have asked the airport management many questions. Some have been answered, some have not,” said Bhattarai.

Perhaps an astrologer suggested the leader of the largest party in Pratinidhi Sabha and the Chair of the Nepali Congress (NC), Sher Bahadur Deuba, to sign a pact with the supremo of the second-largest party in Parliament after midnight. The deal is finally sealed, and the foremost democratic force of the country will be collaborating with the dominant communist party to entrench an ethnocratic regime.Maoist supremo Dahal has been jumping from the NC camp to the UML platform and the other way round with the regularity of a hawker and the dexterity of an acrobat. He had swiftly set up a meeting with Sharma Oli to placate his senior partner in the coalition and offered to quit in favour of the latter to maintain the status quo. The permanent establishment of Nepal (PEON) seems to have scuttled his plans.The PEON has been vouching for a rapprochement between the NC and the UML for quite a while. Since the restoration of parliamentary democracy in 1990, these two parties have joined hands or taken turns ruling the country for much of the duration. They have much more at stake in maintaining the ethnonational oligarchy than the Maoists. When the influence of the two dominant parties was reduced in the Constituent Assembly elections of 2008, they had worked assiduously to have it dissolved through a judicial intervention. No matter how hard Dahal tried to propitiate the high priests of Khas-Arya hegemony—ritualistically worship a buffalo, don the Daura-Suruwal ensemble or offer prescribed prayers at the temple of Mahakal in Ujjain—he failed to win their confidence. In the eyes of ethnonational zealots, Dahal had unleashed the forces of dignity politics—Dalit empowerment, Janjati awakening and Madheshi autonomy—that must be put back in their places through regressive changes in the electoral system.The proponents of Dalit empowerment are still too weak to challenge the existing sociopolitical order. The fragmented and resigned Janjati groups lack the will to resist the hegemonic designs of Khas-Arya ethnonationalists. The only community that could have countered the resurgence of ethnonational majoritarianism was that of Madheshis. Sadly, a craving for the crumbs from the high table has turned most politicos of Madhesh-dependent parties from committed activists to devoted conformists.Externalised MadheshisIt’s difficult to name a Madheshi politician who played an important role in the governance of Nepal in the pre-republican era. Ram Narayan Mishra, a cabinet minister in the short-lived BP Koirala government, stands out as an exception. Put behind bars after the royal-military coup, Mishra remained incarcerated and was freed only to die from a terminal disease. Justice Aniruddha Prasad Singh, Justice Bhagwati Prasad Singh and politician Chaturbhuj Prasad Singh—the ABC Singhs of Saptari—did rise to the highest posts, but they were merely royal loyalists at the beck and call of their master.The restoration of parliamentary democracy brought a new set of political players that shared their ethnonational beliefs with those of the ousted regime. Mahendra Narayan Nidhi was perhaps the best Prime Minister this country never had because of ethnic prejudices among the NC ranks. Gajendra Narayan Singh tried hard to establish amity between Pahadis and Madheshis based on political equality and social dignity through his Sadbhavana platform. He was repeatedly booed in public.Just as in the absolutist Shah era (1960-90), under the name of Panchayat, the highest ambition of an upwardly mobile Madheshi was to ape the dominant community in dress, language and mannerism, and become a mimic man of a “true Nepali”. The violent campaigns of Maoists and counter-violence of the state forces in the aughties were dreadful, but they did succeed in establishing the recognition of diversity in the manufactured uniformity of national unity. It’s the experience of the marginalised and externalised communities between 1990 and 2008 that makes the prospect of a political settlement between the NC and the UML terrifying.Useful toolsWhen the UML emerged as a powerful force of the post-1990 order, its leaders found, to their chagrin, that their presence in Madhesh was limited to the Pahadi community. They wanted Madheshi youths to build their organisation in a region that the NC had traditionally dominated. Ambitious Madheshis also discovered that they had little chance to rise fast in the NC, which was a party in the tight grip of the old guard. In addition to being ambitious, Upendra Yadav also possesses a sharp mind. He was already a foot soldier of the communist radicals, and when they constituted themselves into a parliamentary party as the UML, he became its low-level apparatchik.Yadav used his uncanny ability of sensing the direction of the wind and jumped on the Maoist bandwagon but remained carefully clear of direct armed confrontations. Contentions are often based on inferences, but the allegation that the non-party Madheshi Janadhikar Forum was constituted to counter the Madhesh Mukti Morcha of the Maoists with the covert support of the PEON doesn’t look too far-fetched. Barely active in anti-monarchy protests before 2006, Yadav became the public face of the Madhesh Uprising 2007, which challenged and beat the Maoists at their own game of violent propaganda. He then lost little time in making peace with his former enemies of the Gaur Massacre and became the messiah of sorts in Madhesh after the formation of the first Constituent Assembly in Nepal's history.In much of South Asia, people vote for their caste rather than casting their votes. Yadav prioritised caste solidarity over political affiliations and helped elect Ram Baran Yadav of the NC as the first President of the new republic. The PEON now had a new Yadav face to show in Madhesh and a pliant tool to control the polity and society. The political perseverance and tenacity of Upendra Yadav are admirable, but he seems resigned to his marginalisation after the overt entry of CK Raut into the electoral arena. The masters like to change their horses not just for utility but also for fun. The Yadavs remain the dominant caste in the entire Tarai-Madhesh and are the single largest group with 15.2 percent of the population in Madhesh province. However, an assertion of non-Yadav solidarity between what are colloquially termed the other backward classes (OBCs) and the extremely backward classes (EBCs) castes had necessitated the nurturing of a sufficiently rebellious but conveniently compliant face from the group to counter the possible consolidation of Muslim-Yadav (MY) alliance in Madhesh.Since its formation, the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP) has always been a loose coalition of predominantly upper-caste and primarily comfortable class of politicians in a patron-client relationship with their relatively reliable vote banks. They have little incentive to engage in combative politics.Perhaps it will take a while for Madheshi politicos to realise that conformity breeds contempt, and confrontation with the majoritarian ethnonationalists for political equality, economic justice and social dignity is the only way of making a mark on history.  ","summary":"In most oligarchies of the world, power-sharing arrangements are negotiated behind the curtain and inked in darkness.

The fragmented and resigned Janjati groups lack the will to resist the hegemonic designs of Khas-Arya ethnonationalists. The only community that could have countered the resurgence of ethnonational majoritarianism was that of Madheshis. Sadly, a craving for the crumbs from the high table has turned most politicos of Madhesh-dependent parties from committed activists to devoted conformists.Externalised MadheshisIt’s difficult to name a Madheshi politician who played an important role in the governance of Nepal in the pre-republican era. Ram Narayan Mishra, a cabinet minister in the short-lived BP Koirala government, stands out as an exception. Put behind bars after the royal-military coup, Mishra remained incarcerated and was freed only to die from a terminal disease. Justice Aniruddha Prasad Singh, Justice Bhagwati Prasad Singh and politician Chaturbhuj Prasad Singh—the ABC Singhs of Saptari—did rise to the highest posts, but they were merely royal loyalists at the beck and call of their master.The restoration of parliamentary democracy brought a new set of political players that shared their ethnonational beliefs with those of the ousted regime. Mahendra Narayan Nidhi was perhaps the best Prime Minister this country never had because of ethnic prejudices among the NC ranks. Gajendra Narayan Singh tried hard to establish amity between Pahadis and Madheshis based on political equality and social dignity through his Sadbhavana platform. He was repeatedly booed in public.Just as in the absolutist Shah era (1960-90), under the name of Panchayat, the highest ambition of an upwardly mobile Madheshi was to ape the dominant community in dress, language and mannerism, and become a mimic man of a “true Nepali”. The violent campaigns of Maoists and counter-violence of the state forces in the aughties were dreadful, but they did succeed in establishing the recognition of diversity in the manufactured uniformity of national unity. It’s the experience of the marginalised and externalised communities between 1990 and 2008 that makes the prospect of a political settlement between the NC and the UML terrifying.Useful toolsWhen the UML emerged as a powerful force of the post-1990 order, its leaders found, to their chagrin, that their presence in Madhesh was limited to the Pahadi community. They wanted Madheshi youths to build their organisation in a region that the NC had traditionally dominated. Ambitious Madheshis also discovered that they had little chance to rise fast in the NC, which was a party in the tight grip of the old guard. In addition to being ambitious, Upendra Yadav also possesses a sharp mind. He was already a foot soldier of the communist radicals, and when they constituted themselves into a parliamentary party as the UML, he became its low-level apparatchik.Yadav used his uncanny ability of sensing the direction of the wind and jumped on the Maoist bandwagon but remained carefully clear of direct armed confrontations. Contentions are often based on inferences, but the allegation that the non-party Madheshi Janadhikar Forum was constituted to counter the Madhesh Mukti Morcha of the Maoists with the covert support of the PEON doesn’t look too far-fetched. Barely active in anti-monarchy protests before 2006, Yadav became the public face of the Madhesh Uprising 2007, which challenged and beat the Maoists at their own game of violent propaganda. He then lost little time in making peace with his former enemies of the Gaur Massacre and became the messiah of sorts in Madhesh after the formation of the first Constituent Assembly in Nepal's history.In much of South Asia, people vote for their caste rather than casting their votes. Yadav prioritised caste solidarity over political affiliations and helped elect Ram Baran Yadav of the NC as the first President of the new republic. The PEON now had a new Yadav face to show in Madhesh and a pliant tool to control the polity and society. The political perseverance and tenacity of Upendra Yadav are admirable, but he seems resigned to his marginalisation after the overt entry of CK Raut into the electoral arena. The masters like to change their horses not just for utility but also for fun. The Yadavs remain the dominant caste in the entire Tarai-Madhesh and are the single largest group with 15.2 percent of the population in Madhesh province. However, an assertion of non-Yadav solidarity between what are colloquially termed the other backward classes (OBCs) and the extremely backward classes (EBCs) castes had necessitated the nurturing of a sufficiently rebellious but conveniently compliant face from the group to counter the possible consolidation of Muslim-Yadav (MY) alliance in Madhesh.Since its formation, the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP) has always been a loose coalition of predominantly upper-caste and primarily comfortable class of politicians in a patron-client relationship with their relatively reliable vote banks. They have little incentive to engage in combative politics.Perhaps it will take a while for Madheshi politicos to realise that conformity breeds contempt, and confrontation with the majoritarian ethnonationalists for political equality, economic justice and social dignity is the only way of making a mark on history.  "},{"hash":"ccd486ae19b7647815896be39e36b7e2003190bf5a3f4e95af4797ecc80e8d63","title":"the-human-cost-of-big-sporting-events","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/07/02/the-human-cost-of-big-sporting-events","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/DownReuters-1719927026.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1719878400000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"With the Copa América, the UEFA European Championship and the Olympic Games all taking place over a few months, summer 2024 is shaping up to be a celebration of sport.However, many modern sporting events have been held in countries with appalling human rights records, with little pushback from fans, broadcasters or governments. In a world where celebrities are held to high moral standards—and face consequences for falling short—this inconsistency is striking.My historical research focuses on this troubling issue, aiming to understand why sport often evades the scrutiny we so readily apply to other events and individuals.Qatar 2022For years before its first match began, the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar was marred by accusations of sportswashing, environmental damage, exorbitant costs and, most critically, severe human rights abuses—including the country’s treatment of women, the LGBTQ+ community and migrant workers.Among these widely reported allegations was one especially harrowing statistic: over 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh died while building hotels and stadiums in preparation for the 2022 World Cup. This means that each minute of football played at the tournament equated to the loss of one human life.While the Qatari government put the death toll far lower, at 47, these abuses were no secret in the run up to the event. Still, they had little impact on public opinion—in the weeks leading up to the tournament, fans were more concerned about how the winter timetable would affect the regular football season, or their ability to consume alcohol in a Muslim country.Calls for a boycott failed to catch on, and the event went on to garner high ratings, with one BBC poll even declaring it the best World Cup of the century.Greed and corruption are obvious explanations for how this was allowed to happen. There is substantial evidence of corruption within both FIFA and Qatar, particularly regarding the bidding process for the games.Reports also indicate that some fans were paid by the host to sing and chant on command, and celebrities were paid huge amounts to attend and endorse the event, thereby whitewashing Qatar’s human rights record.Such blatant displays of greed are not always met with apathy. In 2021, for example, the attempt to form the European Super League faced widespread, vehement criticism from fans, football players, managers, and politicians, and the multi-million dollar venture was swiftly axed as a result.The unique, irrational appealObjectively speaking, Qatar’s human rights abuses are unforgivable. However, humanity’s fascination with sport is emotional rather than rational, meaning it is extremely difficult to analyse or explain from an objective point of view.It is therefore worth considering how organisers addressed human rights concerns in the run up to the 2022 World Cup. Shortly before the its opening, FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Secretary General Fatma Samoura wrote the following in a letter to competing teams: “Please, let’s now focus on the football! We know football does not live in a vacuum and we are equally aware that there are many challenges and difficulties of a political nature all around the world. But please do not allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle that exists.”Such a statement may seem cynical and calculated, but it reflects a widespread perception that modern sports are pure, universal and autotelic—meaning an activity in and of itself, rather than a means to an end. This is often expressed in claims like “sport is art”, or that sports should be separate from politics.Sport’s appeal for both participants and spectators therefore lies in its immediacy, and its ability to unify people into an authentic experience of the here and now. The men and women on the field are much more than sweaty people wearing shorts and kicking a ball—to spectators they are heroes of pure beauty.This might help us understand the strikingly and paradoxically different responses to the 2022 World Cup and the Super League. The Super League aimed to usurp the traditional structure of football to benefit big clubs over small ones, but it was perceived as a greedy affront to the purity of sport. However, fans may have been able to accept the death toll of the Qatar World Cup as a necessary sacrifice to preserve the universal, binding power of modern sport.The 1936 ‘Nazi Olympics’The pivotal moment in shaping our modern sporting ethos was the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, also known as the Nazi Olympics. The controversial event ignited a widespread boycott movement, which argued that holding and respecting the games under a fascist and antisemitic regime would tarnish sport’s purity, and vindicate the Third Reich in front of a global audience.Nevertheless, the games went ahead, giving a powerful demonstration of sport’s ability to make the world overlook unspeakable crimes. Oppressive nations today are still following its example.Ethical sporting cultureNearly a hundred years later, Qatar is a candidate to host the 2036 Olympics. Given the death toll of the 2022 World Cup, it is likely that such an event will cost the lives of thousands more workers, and it should be met with firm resistance.However, history teaches us that protests should not be based solely on general terms like “sportswashing” or cynical perspectives that overlook the emotional and tangible meaning that sport holds in people’s lives.As seen in the case of the Super League, sports fans are capable of fighting for the purity of the games they love, but such a fight for the soul of modern sports should not begin only after enjoying the summer tournaments.

Also because of the heat, people may have made their way to the spot where water was kept and that could have caused the incident as well,” she said, adding that 18 were injured and in hospital.Police said they had launched an investigation and promised action against anyone found to be responsible, adding that the gathering may have been larger than had been permitted.“Lapses by authorities will also be investigated and action will be taken on the basis of the report which will be available within 24 hours,” state police chief Prashant Kumar said.Video clips recorded by news agency ANI, in which Reuters has a minority stake, showed bodies piled into the back of trucks and laid out in vehicles.Purses and bags covered in dust, were heaped up at the venue, with people sitting on their haunches sifting through them to identify their belongings.Mobile phones were similarly piled together, waiting to be claimed by their owners.A video on social media showed a large crowd packed into a tented area, standing and listening to devotional tunes as they waved their hands in the direction of the religious leader who sat on a stage.It also showed some women hanging on to the bamboo poles holding up the canopy to get a better view above the heads of the large crowd.Reuters could not immediately verify the social media images.“There must have been about 50,000 people...at the gate on the highway, some people were going left and some people were going right, the stampede was caused in that confusion,” Suresh Chandra, a witness who was at the gathering, told local media.Seema, a woman who travelled from a town almost 60 km away to attend the event, said she was leaving the venue when the stampede occurred.

Just after a week of the municipal meeting, the streets of Bharatpur are littered with heaps of garbage, posing health risks during the monsoon.Waste management has become a major problem in Bharatpur, especially for people living near the banks of the Narayani river, as the riverside serves as the only landfill site for the city of around 370,000 people. And the problem worsens every monsoon as the metropolis disposes of its waste on the banks of the river, which is just 400 metres from Nagarban settlement, making life difficult for all local residents.According to the data of the environment section of Bharatpur Metropolitan City Office, around 70 to 80 tonnes of garbage are being collected in the metropolis daily. Garbage, both renewable and non-renewable, is being deposited on the banks of the Narayani river as the metropolis does not have a well-managed landfill site.The metropolitan city, somehow, manages the solid waste during the dry season. But both the rain-swollen river and locals obstruct the municipal authority in managing garbage during the monsoon season. The garbage trucks cannot reach the designated place as the river banks get flooded in the rainy season. As a result, the sanitation workers are compelled to dump the garbage near human settlements that trigger stringent protests from the locals.“It has been more than 20 years since the metropolis dumped garbage on the riverbank in our ward,” said Bikash Thapa, chairman of ward 3 of Bharatpur metropolis. “During the dry season, the metropolis dumps the garbage a little further from the settlement, but during the monsoon, it dumps and buries the garbage near the settlement. There is no more space left in the area for dumping and burying garbage.”The locals of ward 3 have been obstructing the metropolis from dumping garbage on the riverbank. Garbage has been piled up in the streets since Thursday due to the protest of the local people.Bharatpur metropolis is now looking for an alternative place to dump the garbage after the locals’ disruption in ward 3. “Search is on to find a suitable place in ward 1 to manage the garbage,” said Suraj Paudel, chief at the sanitation management unit of Bharatpur Metropolitan City. According to him, the metropolis and two private companies have been collecting and managing the solid waste currently.The metropolis has been dumping its garbage on the banks of Narayani river for the past 15 years after the then Hetauda Appellate Court issued an order banning the disposal of waste at Jaldevi Community Forest, stating its biological importance. Since then, Bharatpur has been dumping its waste on the Narayani riverbanks, which is just 200-300 metres away from the city area.The federal government in the fiscal year 2011-12 had allotted 15 bigha of land in the Jaldevi Community Forest to the metropolitan city to build a well-managed landfill site. As compensation for the use of the forestland, the metropolis some five years ago had purchased another 15 bighas (10 hectares) of land in Madi to be used for reforestation. But the Division Forest Office in Bharatpur in 2023 refused to swap forest land with the land that the metropolis purchased in Madi as that land does not adjoin the national forest. As a result, the metropolitan city’s plan to construct a landfill site remains in limbo.“We have been seriously working on garbage management,” said Mayor Renu Dahal in a press meet organised to conclude the municipal meeting last week. “We are yet to get results despite working sincerely for the construction of a well managed landfill site.” The metropolis allocates a Rs50 million budget to manage garbage for the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Bharatpur, one of the country’s six metropolitan cities, is still struggling to find a location for the landfill site. In 2018, the metropolitan office signed an agreement with the Sudokwon Landfill Site Management Corporation of South Korea to come up with a master plan for a proper waste management system. The masterplan was to be prepared within 15 months from the date of the agreement.“The agreement was signed for the proper waste management of the city. We thought that the Korean company would come with the master plan,” said Dahal, assuring that an alternative landfill site will be sought soon to initiate construction work. “But the company did not work citing the Covid-19 pandemic.

As soon as the borders—land and air—opened, and the China-funded international airport in Pokhara was inaugurated, optimism was high. Before the pandemic, market insiders predicted a dramatic surge in Chinese tourists, who were Nepal’s second-largest source market after India before the Covid-19 pandemic. It didn’t happen. Nepal received 60,878 Chinese tourists in 2023, a recovery by a third from the pre-pandemic level when Chinese tourists boomed in Nepal.In the first five months (January–May) of this year, Nepal received 46,671 Chinese, with the highest arrival of 12,093 recorded in March. While Chinese arrivals slowed, Indian tourists boomed in Nepal, reaching an all-time high of 319,936 individuals, according to the Department of Immigration. Among Indians, only those who come by air are counted as tourists in Nepal. In the first five months, Nepal has received 148,861 Indian tourists, the highest number of 38,288 recorded in May. Before the pandemic, India and China were competing neck-to-neck. Now, there is a huge imbalance between the south and north.Will it change? On Monday, during the 16th round of the Nepal-China diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting held in Kathmandu, Beijing made a surprise announcement.It announced plans to promote Nepali tourism in China as part of celebrating 2025 as ‘Visit Nepal Year in China’, which Nepal’s top travel trade entrepreneurs say is a “big statement.” They say they had never before heard China favour any country with such soft power diplomacy.Will 2025 be the year for the potential great return of Chinese tourists then? “So far, I haven’t heard or seen Beijing promote any country’s tourism inside China. This is, in fact, a good gesture of neighbourliness,” said Kishore Raj Pandey, chairman of Saathi Nepal Travel and Tours, who was the first person to bring Chinese tourists to Nepal in 2001.“If it has been announced, Beijing indeed has some policy to encourage Chinese citizens to travel to Nepal.”Tourism is vital for Nepal’s economy. According to the recently released annual World Travel and Tourism Council research report, Nepal’s tourism sector generated Rs327.9 billion ($2.5 billion) in revenue and supported 1.19 million jobs directly and indirectly last year. The report forecasts that Nepal will generate 1.22 million jobs in 2024. Last year, the country received 1 million tourists.Some critics say it’s a lofty promise. Before Monday’s meeting, during the third Nepal Investment Summit held in Kathmandu on April 28, Luo Zhaohui, chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, announced the waiver of visa fees for Nepalis.It was implemented on May 1. There was another announcement, too.“The Chinese government is making arrangements to start new flights from China to Nepal’s two new international airports—Pokhara and Lumbini,” Luo said while addressing the summit.Nepal’s $216 million international airport in Pokhara, the country’s tourism capital, opened in January last year. Beijing financed it.Similarly, Nepal’s second international airport in Bhairahawa, built by Chinese contractors, started operating in May 2022 after four years of construction delays. The objectives of both projects are to decentralise economic activities in the new federal setup, attract more tourists, and prevent Nepalis from going abroad.But only some international flights are operating in the two new shiny airports.“Under Beijing's renewed diplomacy, there is a possibility of the operation of these two new international airports,” said Basant Raj Mishra, a senior tourism entrepreneur. “Once flights from China come, it will create competition.”He said Beijing’s announcement represents a great opportunity for Nepal. “We should be prepared for joint marketing and promotional activities. With a proper policy, we can attract 1 million tourists from China alone in 2025. And for this, we need enhanced flight connectivity.”China is facing many economic obstacles, but Beijing remains optimistic about growth.Reports show that Chinese tourists hit the road in significant numbers during the recent five-day Labor holidays in May but kept a tight grip on their wallets, reflecting still-weak sentiment in the world’s second-largest economy.According to a statement from China’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism, travellers made 28.2 percent more trips, but spending only rose 13.5 percent from the 2019 break. “Of all the countries, China has the largest number of airlines connecting Nepal but brings the lowest number of tourists,” said Vijay Shrestha, vice president (Administration) at Himalaya Airlines, the Nepal-Tibet joint venture. There are five airlines currently connecting China. “The traffic is low,” said Shrestha. “It may be due to low consumer confidence.”Himalaya Airlines has suspended Kathmandu-Beijing flights, and Kathmandu-Shanghai flights are also irregular due to low passenger traffic. Besides, in the other three sectors, the average occupancy is 40 percent,” said Shrestha. “The announcement from Beijing to promote Nepal in China could change that.”Nepal and China established formal diplomatic relations in 1955, and Nepal-Tibet trade goes a long way back. In 1956, four cities of Tibet, namely Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyantse, and Yatung, were designated as major trading cities for Nepali traders.Between the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 and 1982, few residents of China travelled to foreign destinations other than government officials, students, and a few businessmen. In 1983, China allowed citizens from Guangdong Province to travel to the British colony of Hong Kong on organised tours to visit family.Beginning in 1995, the Chinese National Tourism Administration formalised China’s Approved Destination Status (ADS) policy.The history of Chinese tourism in Nepal is not long either. Nepal first participated in the China International Travel Fair in 2000 to promote its tourism sector. Before 2000, the Chinese could only travel to Nepal on official visits.The Chinese government had permitted ADS for Chinese outbound travellers in November 2001. The two countries signed an initial memorandum of understanding on an implementation plan for outbound travel by Chinese people to Nepal on April 16, 2001, laying the groundwork for the ADS.Nepal was given the Approved Destination Status (ADS) by its northern neighbour in 2002, and in June of the same year, Chinese citizens began visiting Nepal officially for the first time as tourists. Nepal was the 18th nation to receive the status and first in South Asia. In 2002, Nepal got 8,715 Chinese tourists.Subsequently, the central banks of the two countries signed an agreement on bilateral cooperation that allowed the Chinese currency to be converted into Nepali rupees in a bid to boost bilateral trade, tourism, and economic cooperation.However, immediately after Nepal received the ADS, arrivals from China fell due to a violent conflict that intensified over 2002-2004, reaching Nepal’s main cities and tourist destinations. Nepal eventually started witnessing a constant growth in Chinese arrivals after June 2009.Chinese arrivals to Nepal crossed the 100,000 mark for the first time in 2013, mainly due to the improved air links between the two countries. According to the tourism ministry’s statistics, around 93 percent of Chinese tourists were first-time visitors to Nepal.In 2014, Nepal received 123,805 Chinese visitors.The 2015 earthquake and India's blockade led to arrivals from China dropping to a four-year low of 64,675 individuals in 2015, down 47.76 percent from 2014.The surface road at the Tatopani border point, where Nepal used to receive many Chinese tourists, was also blocked.On December 25, 2015, Nepal announced ‘free visa’ for Chinese tourists, giving them the same treatment accorded to South Asian visitors. In a bid to revive flagging arrivals, the scheme was implemented in January 2016.Thereon, tourist arrivals from China started rising steadily, and Nepal saw the strongest growth, 46.8 percent, in tourist arrivals from China, with the overall number reaching 153,633 visitors in 2018.In 2019, Nepal received a record 169,543 Chinese tourists.The number fell to 19,257 in 2020. In 2021 and 2022, there were 6,198 and 9,599 Chinese tourists in Nepal—mainly diplomats and those stranded in third countries—who came to Nepal when Beijing enforced never-ending lockdowns.When the Chinese economy started to boom again, Nepali investors pumped money into luxury hotels, which too have multiplied.

In 1956, four cities of Tibet, namely Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyantse, and Yatung, were designated as major trading cities for Nepali traders.Between the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 and 1982, few residents of China travelled to foreign destinations other than government officials, students, and a few businessmen. In 1983, China allowed citizens from Guangdong Province to travel to the British colony of Hong Kong on organised tours to visit family.Beginning in 1995, the Chinese National Tourism Administration formalised China’s Approved Destination Status (ADS) policy.The history of Chinese tourism in Nepal is not long either. Nepal first participated in the China International Travel Fair in 2000 to promote its tourism sector. Before 2000, the Chinese could only travel to Nepal on official visits.The Chinese government had permitted ADS for Chinese outbound travellers in November 2001. The two countries signed an initial memorandum of understanding on an implementation plan for outbound travel by Chinese people to Nepal on April 16, 2001, laying the groundwork for the ADS.Nepal was given the Approved Destination Status (ADS) by its northern neighbour in 2002, and in June of the same year, Chinese citizens began visiting Nepal officially for the first time as tourists. Nepal was the 18th nation to receive the status and first in South Asia. In 2002, Nepal got 8,715 Chinese tourists.Subsequently, the central banks of the two countries signed an agreement on bilateral cooperation that allowed the Chinese currency to be converted into Nepali rupees in a bid to boost bilateral trade, tourism, and economic cooperation.However, immediately after Nepal received the ADS, arrivals from China fell due to a violent conflict that intensified over 2002-2004, reaching Nepal’s main cities and tourist destinations. Nepal eventually started witnessing a constant growth in Chinese arrivals after June 2009.Chinese arrivals to Nepal crossed the 100,000 mark for the first time in 2013, mainly due to the improved air links between the two countries. According to the tourism ministry’s statistics, around 93 percent of Chinese tourists were first-time visitors to Nepal.In 2014, Nepal received 123,805 Chinese visitors.The 2015 earthquake and India's blockade led to arrivals from China dropping to a four-year low of 64,675 individuals in 2015, down 47.76 percent from 2014.The surface road at the Tatopani border point, where Nepal used to receive many Chinese tourists, was also blocked.On December 25, 2015, Nepal announced ‘free visa’ for Chinese tourists, giving them the same treatment accorded to South Asian visitors. In a bid to revive flagging arrivals, the scheme was implemented in January 2016.Thereon, tourist arrivals from China started rising steadily, and Nepal saw the strongest growth, 46.8 percent, in tourist arrivals from China, with the overall number reaching 153,633 visitors in 2018.In 2019, Nepal received a record 169,543 Chinese tourists.The number fell to 19,257 in 2020. In 2021 and 2022, there were 6,198 and 9,599 Chinese tourists in Nepal—mainly diplomats and those stranded in third countries—who came to Nepal when Beijing enforced never-ending lockdowns.When the Chinese economy started to boom again, Nepali investors pumped money into luxury hotels, which too have multiplied.

Along with the victim, relatives brought the live snake in a bottle to show the doctor as proof.“The snake was a king cobra,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at the Hospital. “Fortunately, the venom had not penetrated deep into the victim’s body, and after three days of treatment, the victim was discharged. We called a snake handler and handed over the king cobra.”Sindhupalchowk is a mountain district where venomous snakes were thought of as non-existent. However, incidents of king cobra bites in mountain districts like Sindhupalchowk suggest that venomous snakes have started migrating towards hill and mountain districts, and rising temperatures caused by climate change are the main culprit, experts say.Nepal is among the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising at a faster rate of 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year. Compared to districts of the Tarai region, those in hills and mountains have been witnessing a more rapid increase in daytime maximum temperatures, which could have helped venomous snakes survive there, experts say.“Not only in Sindhupalchowk, but a king cobra bite was also spotted in Godawari of Lalitpur district last year,” said Basaula. “Snakebite cases have started rising alarmingly of late.”Of the 31 patients admitted to the hospital on Sunday, 16—more than 50 percent—were snakebite cases. Doctors at the hospital say eight to ten snakebite victims seek treatment there every day, and most victims seeking care at the hospital are from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from those adjoining the Valley.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.However, snakebite cases are vastly underreported in the country. The Ministry of Health and Population said that only 14 deaths and 1,220 cases of snakebites had been reported in 11 months of the current fiscal year. Officials admit that venomous snakebite incidents are being reported from hill and mountain districts, and the demand for anti-snake venom is on the rise. They attribute this rise in snakebite incidents to rising temperatures. “Health facilities in some mountainous and hilly districts—like Darchula and Bajura—have asked for anti-snake venom,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Snakebite incidents have been on the rise,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the division. “With the onset of the monsoon, people living in the risk areas should remain vigilant.”Every year, the Health Ministry purchases around 25,000 vials of anti-snake venom and distributes them to around 100 snakebite treatment centres in the country.Officials say as snakebite cases surge, so will the demand for additional treatment centres. “This year, we are planning to set up an additional 15 snakebite treatment centres,” said Ojha. Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive about the risks. They say people living in thatched-roof houses are particularly vulnerable to snakebites, as snakes often enter such homes in search of rats. They say people should be asked to keep their homes and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in bushy areas, avoid venturing out at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.Likewise, women and children who have to work in fields and go to the jungle are at the highest risk of snakebites. Small children are at risk of dying from snakebites, as they do not tell their parents about the bites on time due to fear of getting scolded for playing in the bushes, according to doctors.“We should make people aware so that they seek medical attention immediately after a snakebite, using whatever means of transport they get,” said Ojha. “The faster you reach the hospital, the greater your chances of survival.” ","summary":"Last month, a local from Sindhupalchowk district was brought to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital to treat a snakebite.

The duel has attracted numerous newspaper articles, set social media on fire and provided YouTubers a field day. What is Oli’s motive in mobilising his whole party to attack Balen, and what is Balen—a lone man with no political experience and political following—doing picking a fight with Oli? How will the duel impact Oli’s party and Balen’s aspirations going forward? The fightThe Balen-Oli fight began when the metropolitan city started to clear buildings built illegally on municipal land or business advertisements that did not comply with municipal regulations. The city would order the current occupants of the offending buildings or business owners to comply with the law and vacate the premises. In most cases, the occupants would ignore the order. Like in old times, they relied on their political connections to continue to subvert the law. However, that did not work with Balen. He sent municipal forces to demolish the encroachment and non-compliant adverts. The first property subjected to the mayor's action belonged to someone connected to the UML. Soon after the clearance, a Central Committee member of the UML, Mahesh Basnet, called upon his minions to physically harm Balen if he did not “mend his ways”.Balen’s attempt to clean up Kathmandu from squatters occupying public land, particularly river banks, intensified the conflict. Oli publicly mocked Balen for using bulldozers to demolish plastic shades built by “poor squatters.” Some “squatters” are believed to occupy multistory buildings constructed on public land and own businesses worth millions of rupees. The majority of them are UML voters, “UMLs’ vote bank”, observed a Balen supporter. The squatter problem is not new. All previous governments, including the one led by Oli, recognised it. The conflict became increasingly acrimonious when Balen opened the basement of Dharahara for car parking. The government objected, arguing that the reconstruction of Dharahara is still incomplete and the car park is unsafe to use. Balen retorted, “Dharahara was inaugurated as a completed project by Prime Minister Oli before the last election. How can it be incomplete?” The inauguration of the work-in-progress was one of Prime Minister Oli’s pre-election charades. The car park is safe and currently in use; the reconstruction continues. The recent New Road imbroglio added fuel to the fire. Balen started widening the footpath on New Road to comply with the standards set by the Nepal Department of Roads (NDR). A local ward chair, a UML member, objected and complained to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ragubhir Mahaseth, an Oli acolyte. The NDR, which reports to Mahaseth, issued a “stop work” order. Incensed, Balen asked Oli to expeditiously arrange repayment for those who cheated the so-called Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land plotting scandal. Oli’s apparatchiks compared Balen to “a puppy” (a good-for-nothing weakling) and chastised him for maligning “our respected Chairman”. Oli himself has described Balen as a “bubble” which will fizzle out in no time. The fightersOli is old, witty, foxy, prickly, intolerant of criticism and, like all other politicians, corrupt in the public eye. As enunciated during his premiership, his vision of economic development includes building view towers, providing Kathmandu households with piped gas within six months, and building facilities for maritime trade—the latter two unachievable pipe dreams or political ploys. Balen is young, angry, ambitious, audacious, brash, bold, impulsive, focussed and untainted by corruption. His vision for Kathmandu is to make it a clean, functioning, beautiful heritage city. In about two years since he became mayor, Kathmandu has become relatively cleaner and greener. Its roads are rid of perpetual potholes; its sidewalks are walkable; teaching standards in public schools have improved; private schools who were short-changing on paying taxes have been forced to pay their share; emergency ambulance service has become more dependable, and so on. All of the above, despite a lack of support from political parties and the government. Parties do not support him because his success will spotlight their past failures. Despite the odds, his accomplishments have made him hugely popular throughout the country. “If we have ten leaders like Balen, we can change the country,” an exuberant Kathmandu taxi driver told me. Even the international press has taken note of Balen’s leadership. The New York Times published a story on Balen last year. He was named one of the 100 upcoming leaders in 2023 by the internationally known Time Magazine, published in the US. Balen’s public support is so visceral that he gets away even with outrageous comments like “burning Singha Durbar’, Nepal’s central secretariat, the office of Nepal’s Ministries, and irrelevant dragging of Oli into the “Giri Bandhu Tea Estate” scandal, and other similar outbursts. Although the overwhelming support for such comments on social media is surprising, it is indicative of the intensity of public dislike of established politicians.The future Balen knows that he owes his popularity as much to his performance as his refusal to bow down to political pressure and to stay clean from corruption scandals. In the two years since he assumed office, he has given confidence to the city dwellers that with exemplary leadership, the city and the country can be changed. His future depends on whether he can continue to ignore political pressure and demonstrate his perseverance, will, guts and vision to turn chaotic Kathmandu into a livable metropolis. As for Oli, UML lost the last election in Kathmandu because its mayor, a UML member, was a dismal failure. The confrontation with Balen for political upmanship and ego inflation will unlikely win Kathmandu for him. Cooperation may work better than confrontation.    ","summary":"The duel between Kathmandu’s 34-year-old mayor Balendra Shaha (popularly called Balen), a structural engineer, reputed rapper and political novice, and 72-year-old Khagda Prasad Sharma Oli, a high school dropout, two-time prime minister, political veteran and chairperson of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) is a caricature of contemporary Nepali politics marred by the conflict between the old and the young.

This question struck me when I visited the Siddhartha Art Gallery's latest exhibition featuring Kalighat paintings. I found myself amused and conflicted by one piece, ‘Babu and Bibi II,’ in which a bourgeois woman holds a leash attached to a dog with a man's head. In today's art world, feminism has become a buzzword—from discussions in my homeland of Cyprus to my university classrooms in the US and now here in Kathmandu. Yet, beyond the surface-level rhetoric of ‘feminism’ and ‘equality’, deeper conversations often reveal these concepts' ambiguity and diverse interpretations. Feminism means something different to everyone, even within the same progressive circles.Siddhartha Art Gallery’s exhibition places three story-telling art forms in conversation with one another: Patachitra, Bilampau, and Kalighat paintings. Patachitra is the original art form from which folk artists deviated to invent the Bilampau and Kalighat styles. This is one of the most unique aspects of the exhibition; by placing all three styles alongside one another, visitors can see the evolution of folk art as it travelled across South Asia. Bilampau paintings result from the Patachitra tradition of crossing from India into Nepal, and Kalighat is the product of the migration of Patachitra artists to Kolkata. All three art styles share certain narrative and symbolic attributes. When stepping into the gallery, the Kalighat paintings stand out the most as they differ quite from Patachitra and Bilampau in style and subject matter. Unlike the other two painting styles, these paintings depict a scene with only one or two characters and have no background details. Nepali Bilampau narrative scrolls differ from Patachitra in that they tell a story from left to right rather than vertically. Apart from the direction of the narrative, Bilampau and Patachitra paintings are largely similar in featured stories and style. Before stepping into the exhibition, I hadn’t encountered Kalighat paintings, but their depiction of women immediately captured my attention. These small-scale artworks defy conventional gender roles, blending humour with a sharp critique of their time's moral and social norms. What drew my interest was that the artists' intentions are almost completely left to the imagination.Diving into the context of Kalighat paintings sheds some light on their potentially intended messages and whether they can be dubbed as ‘feminist’ or not. These paintings trace directly back to the goddess Kali, often called the ‘mother Goddess’.Kali destroys evil to protect the innocent and is associated with power, change, deviance, and time—all traits that result in her depictions being strongly connected to feminism.The Kalighat art style was born around a temple dedicated to the Goddess Kali, the Kalighat temple, in 19th-century Kolkata (then Calcutta). Folk ‘patua’ artists migrated to the city, near the Kalighat temple, as it became a trade centre in colonial India.These artists were trained in Patachitra narrative scroll paintings, which were several feet long and contained some narrative scenes.Once the folk ‘patua’ artists moved to Kolkata, many saw an opportunity in the popularity of the Kalighat temple.Shifting away from their narrative scrolls, they began to use their artistic skills to produce portable depictions of the Goddess Kali and other deities for people to take home as religious souvenirs. It didn’t take long for these ‘Kalighat paintings’ to grow in popularity, and the art style emerged as a distinct art genre.These initial versions of Kalighat paintings can also be seen in the Siddhartha Art Gallery’s new exhibition, such as a beautiful piece depicting Krishna playing the flute for Radha and a piece named ‘Kalighat Kali’.The second phase of these paintings is where the scenes become more interesting and potentially controversial. In the mid-1900s, Kalighat artists moved away from solely religious characters and began using their paintings as an active means of subversion.Their paintings focused on the pretensions of the ‘Babu culture’—the Westernised, upper-class Bengali men who adopted European mannerisms and fashions.The influence of British colonialism on gender roles and Babus and Bibis in Bengal cannot be understated.As Western ideas and practices permeated Bengali society, traditional gender roles were challenged and reinterpreted. Kalighat artists navigated these shifts with astute observation and artistic flair, capturing the tension between tradition and Western modernity concepts.The Babus and Bibis featured in each painting are distinctive in their dress and jewellery, which are always lavish and influenced by European culture. What may be first noticed in Siddhartha’s current collection is that Babus also nearly always have a long, thin moustache, while Bibis are voluptuous and wear relatively revealing clothing.These caricatures entertained the public and served as cautionary tales, warning against the pitfalls of excess and moral decay caused by opulence.British colonial officers were also sometimes depicted in humorous anti-colonial scenes. Kalighat artists became widely known for their keen sense of humour and a sharp eye for social satire.Multiple artists or whole families often made these artworks, each member performing a specific task such as paper preparation, outlining, or shading. Most importantly, the artists never signed their works or gave their works titles, meaning that the exact origins and intended meanings of the depicted scenes are not specified for the viewers.In other words, each work that a visitor sees in the gallery’s exhibition, or any other collection, has been given a title by the curator rather than the artists behind the work.Therefore, even though the chosen expressions and positioning in each painting always tell a story, the artist's intended message is left up to interpretation, which can be wildly misleading in many cases.In some Kalighat artworks featured in the exhibition, we can see where the artist’s intended meaning and the later given title potentially drastically conflict. For example, a painting labelled ‘Bibi with her pets’ features Bibi sitting on a chair with a snake, tiger and bull at her feet.Since the bull and tiger are depicted drinking from the same dish, this scene could be referencing a Bengali saying, “baghe-gorute ek ghate jol khaowa,” which roughly translates to “a person/force so powerful, they can make a tiger and a cow drink water from the same source.”This image of a woman overlooking a cow and a tiger drinking together peacefully directly suggests that the woman is incredibly powerful and is possibly a loose reference to the Goddess Kali. Contradictorily, the painting’s later-assigned title subtly demeans the seated woman.By dubbing these animals as ‘pets’, the perception of the painting is transformed, and her position in the chair becomes one of leisure, aimlessness, and materialism.Another key example of the range of meaning that could be taken away from these paintings is ‘Babu and Bibi IV’. In this work, Babu is seen kneeling at Bibi’s feet while Bibi looks down on Babu, holds her hair and steps on his clothing.On the one hand, this scene could be interpreted as the normalisation of women being in positions of power in a relationship, conversely suggesting that men do not need to subscribe to hyper-masculine ideals.On the other hand, the scene could be mocking men who do not follow the patriarchy and demeaning them for allowing their wives to subordinate them. Depending on which interpretation you choose to take from each work featured in the exhibition or what title it is given, Kalighat paintings can result in contradictory narratives about feminism.‘Babu and Bibi IV’ is one of many paintings in the exhibition where women are depicted with agency and independence, challenging traditional patriarchal norms in both Indian and colonial societies.This subversion of gender norms within the paintings can be seen as a form of resistance against the influence of European culture on Bengali society. At the same time, considering that this art style originated from depictions of the Goddess Kali, one can see how the artists’ intentions may have been leaning towards women's empowerment rather than the satirising of men who did not follow masculine ideals.Despite the seemingly open-ended intentions of the Kalighat artists, they certainly used Kalighat paintings to produce visual commentaries on the evolving social landscape shaped by colonial pressures and indigenous responses.The exhibition offers an unmissable visual exploration of the evolution of the patachitra tradition in Bengali society. Through these artworks, viewers are given a glimpse into a time of cultural flux and social upheaval, where artists boldly challenge prevailing norms and ideologies through their works.As the world continues to evolve, Kalighat paintings resonate as a testament to the enduring power of art to provoke, inspire, and expose the human experience. ","summary":"Is the portrayal of a woman in a position of power inherently feminist? This question struck me when I visited the Siddhartha Art Gallery's latest exhibition featuring Kalighat paintings. I found myself amused and conflicted by one piece, ‘Babu and Bibi II,’ in which a bourgeois woman holds a leash attached to a dog with a man's head. In today's art world, feminism has become a buzzword—from discussions in my homeland of Cyprus to my university classrooms in the US and now here in Kathmandu.

Party spokesperson Parkash Saran Mahat said that after a meeting of the party's office bearers and former office bearers on Monday, the party concluded that Nepal should only accept grants, not loans for implementing BRI projects. “The debt burden is already high, so the party has decided that further debt should not be taken for implementing BRI projects,” he said. During the 16th round of the Nepal-China diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting, held on June 25 in Kathmandu, the two parties had planned to finalise the BRI implementation plan, but they could not agree on the modality for financing projects. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nepal corresponded with the Prime Minister’s Office to seek approval for signing the implementation plan during the diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting attended by Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong, but it failed. The Congress, however, has been vocal in advocating for grants to implement BRI projects. During the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s Nepal visit in March 2022, then Prime Minister Deuba had conveyed that Nepal would not implement BRI projects through loans. Congress leaders also said that President Sher Bahadur Deuba, during his meeting with CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli at the latter’s residence in Balkot on Saturday, discussed the funding modality of BRI. The Congress, which is the largest party in Parliament, held a gathering of its sitting and former office bearers on Monday following Saturday’s meeting between party chief Deuba and UML chair Oli. While the meeting between Deuba and Oli sparked speculations about the two parties potentially cooperating to form a government, the Congress leaders, after Monday’s meeting, dismissed such a possibility anytime soon. Congress spokesman Mahat categorically denied that the issue of Congress-UML collaboration on the government was discussed at Monday’s meeting. But he did not rule out the possibility of the two parties coming together in the future. Mahat outlined the conditions under which the two largest parties in the parliament could potentially collaborate: a stable and effective government, resolution of election-related challenges, and a clear path towards national stability and prosperity. “The Congress party believes that political issues should take precedence over the government’s role,” Mahat said. “On cooperation, our party is open to cooperating with all parties on pressing national issues.”He also said that the party is in discussion not just with the UML, but also with other parties for possible cooperation.However, a close ally of Deuba claimed that during the Saturday meeting, Deuba proposed Oli as the prime minister for the first round should the two parties cooperate to form a new government.  “As far as I know, Deuba is not in the mood to be prime minister at the moment,” the Congress leader who was present at the office bearer and former office bearer meeting on Monday told the Post. “In such circumstances, if two parties come together to form a government, Oli would lead it first.” A government of the two parties might be formed, but not in the next few days, said the Congress leader. Similarly, the Congress meeting on Monday also decided to extend the tenures of its sister organisation by six months. Their terms were expiring on July 4. “Today’s meeting decided to extend the terms of the sister organisations so that they can elect new office bearers within six months,” Jeevan Pariyar, the Deputy General Secretary of the party, told the Post. Meanwhile, Pariyar also said that the meeting decided to send the report of the party’s Mahasamiti meeting in February to the central committee for approval with amendments. During the Mahasamiti meeting, Vice-President Purna Bahadur Khadka had presented a policy document, General Secretary Gagan Thapa had proposed organisational reforms, General Secretary Bishwa Parkash Sharma had presented a document on contemporary political issues, and spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat a document on the economic situation, prospects and future direction. General Secretary Thapa's proposal drew controversy within the party. In it, he urged the party to contest the upcoming election on its own strength without forming any electoral alliance. Later, on March 4, the CPN (Maoist Centre) ditched its collaboration with the Congress and brought the UML into the government. The party pointed to Thapa’s proposal as a reason for a change in the ruling coalition.  ","summary":"Nepali Congress once again has reiterated that Nepal is not interested in loan funding of Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) projects.

Barely four months after extending support to Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s leadership of the government, CPN-UML, the second largest party in Parliament, has decided to end its political association with Dahal and join hands with Nepali Congress, the largest party. Saturday’s apparently sudden meeting between Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Oli at the latter’s residence laid the ground for a potential new political alliance between the two parties.Multiple senior Congress and UML leaders told the Post that Deuba and Oli had already reached an understanding in a meeting on Sunday midnight at an undisclosed location in Kathmandu, where they tentatively agreed to form a new government, amend the constitution, and to work out a power-sharing formula, which they reportedly shared with a few confidants. As per the understanding between Congress and UML, Oli will lead a new ‘national consensus’ government for a year and a half. For the remaining term, Deuba will be the prime minister, a Nepali Congress leader who is preparing a draft agreement between the two parties told the Post on Monday night. A four-member task force has prepared the draft agreement, which will be released on Tuesday. It will detail the power-sharing arrangement, propose amendments to the constitution, review the electoral system including proportional representation, change national assembly arrangements, and discuss size of provincial assemblies, according to a taskforce member. Ramesh Lekhak and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki from the Congress and Shankar Pokhrel and Ramesh Badal from the UML had held several rounds of talks in the past two weeks, said a UML leader. If everything goes according to plan, a deal will be public by Tuesday, and chairman Oli will stake claim to the post of prime minister on Tuesday itself, a UML minister said. Two Congress leaders familiar with the meeting as per the understanding between Oli and Deuba, Oli will lead the new government with the support of Nepali Congress and other fringe parties. The Congress will lead 10 ministries including home, and the UML nine including finance, as per the draft understanding. Likewise, the Congress and the UML will lead three provincial governments each, with the government in Madhesh to be led by a regional party. There has also been a verbal agreement on formation of a high-powered constitution review and suggestions committee under a former chief justice of the Supreme Court. Deuba and Oli had reportedly been in talks over the past one month in order to address some pressing national issues, and have agreed to amend the constitution where needed. They are also said to have reached understandings on foreign policy, economic crisis, and governance.One big issue that is said to have caused a rift between Prime Minister Dahal and Oli was over the appointment of the chairman of the Securities Board of Nepal or Sebon. The appointment process was ultimately cancelled on Saturday due to differences between the two leaders.Sources inside the Finance Ministry said the selection process became the victim of the political power play between the UML and the Maoist Centre, leading to the cancellation of the entire process.But after a meeting between the two on Monday morning, a Cabinet meeting later in the day decided to give continuity to the old three-member committee to nominate candidates for Sebon chair.Some media reports tried to link the latest Deuba-Oli meeting with yet another development, as it took place a day after Nepal Police arrested Bechan Jha, one of the alleged middlemen in the high-profile Bhutanese refugee scam.Police last year filed cases against politicians, bureaucrats and middlemen on charges of defrauding hundreds of people by promising to send them to the US as Bhutanese refugees. But police were not able to book Jha despite his connection with the scam.Jha is allegedly close to many political leaders, including senior Congress leaders, and the Congress leadership might have been worried that they too could be dragged into the refugee scam.Differences between Oli and Dahal had been steadily building, including over the new Sebon chair, the appointment of ambassadors to eight countries, transitional justice, and the bringing of what Oli termed a ‘Maoist budget’ for the new fiscal year. During their meeting on Monday morning, Oli reportedly requested Dahal to support him by stepping down. “I had serious discussions with Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on the formation of a new government in order to make some changes to the constitution and to address some pressing national issues,” a UML leader quoted Oli as telling him. According to the UML leader, Dahal offered Oli the post of prime minister within the current ruling coalition, but Oli politely turned down the offer. The UML chair instead expressed his desire to lead a consensus government, the UML leader told the Post.Deuba and Oli were in talks for a month through different channels. After several rounds of back-channel talks and negotiations between the second-ranking leaders of the Nepali Congress and UML, they finally agreed to meet.According to the two UML leaders who were briefed about the latest situation, time has come to form a government based on national consensus in order to address the country’s daunting challenges.Prime Minister Dahal had called a meeting of ruling partners for 5:00 pm on Monday, but the meeting had to be postponed in light of the new situation. Dahal, who was all set to reshuffle the Cabinet, was planning to discuss the same in the meeting.   ","summary":"CPN-UML leader K.P.

In the past five years, imports of EVs from China jumped 35 times, suggesting EV adoption in Nepal is now outpacing that of conventional combustion vehicles which use engines that burn fossil fuels, such as petrol or diesel. The EVs have overtaken conventional combustion vehicles.The imports of fossil fuel-consuming passenger vehicles were 10,310 units worth Rs9.24 billion in 2019-20. After four years, in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, imports of conventional combustion vehicles were down to 3,537 units worth Rs4.21 billionHowever, overall vehicle imports have jumped from Rs65.02 billion in 2019-20 to Rs80 billion in the first 11 months of 2023-24.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 11,466 units of EVs worth Rs29 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, or by mid-June. The imports were 3,870 units worth Rs11.23 billion in the same period last fiscal year. Of the total EV imports, a third came from China. Customs data show that Nepal imported 7,931 units of EVs from China, accounting for 69 percent of the total EV imports in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. This translates to Rs21 billion in value.After China, the majority of EVs were imported from India. In the review period, imports from India amounted to Rs6 billion, or 3,277 units. Until the last fiscal year, India was Nepal’s top EV supplier.The data show that Nepal imported 2,205 EVs worth Rs5.94 billion from India in the last fiscal year. In the same period, imports from China were 1,269 units worth Rs3.75 billion.Nepal’s imports of EVs jumped sharply by 158.23 percent in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. Importers say BYD, a Chinese multinational, has taken over the Nepali market. The government collected revenue of Rs13.06 billion from the import of EVs in the review period.Akash Golchha, senior vice president of the Nepal Automobile Dealers Association, said the ongoing economic slowdown has not stopped Nepalis from buying EVs. However, petrol or diesel-run vehicle sales could have been better.EV sales and orders saw a dramatic surge before the budget was announced on May 28. Cimex Inc Pvt Ltd, the authorised distributor of BYD Auto Industry Co Ltd in Nepal, said it had achieved a milestone by delivering 50 cutting-edge BYD EVs in a single day on May 18. According to the company, all 50 units were sold from its service centre at Guheshwari, Kathmandu.According to Cimex, the company imported 4,000 EVs in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. The import of Chinese EVs is high due to their larger production compared to India, said the company, which is among the top EV brands in Nepal.BYD’s Atto and Dolphin are the most preferred models among Nepali customers. With the recent hike in excise and customs duties, the company said the new price list of BYDs will be unveiled soon.“There was fear among buyers that the government may raise duty on EVs in the budget. As a result, the demand surged dramatically,” said Golchha. “The high import increased the stock of EVs.”Automobile dealers said that the government hiked the duty on EVs by 10 percent in the budget for the coming fiscal year 2024-25, which, however, may not impact the sales.Golchha said the government did not make drastic changes in the import duty of EVs in the budget, which may help EV sales boom in the coming days. “The EV demand will grow at a faster pace.”Auto dealers say the import boost for EVs is mainly due to banks’ easy financing. Banks lend up to 90 percent of the vehicle’s cost.Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun, in the annual budget for the upcoming fiscal year, revised the customs and excise duty rates on the import of EVs. The customs duty on EVs of up to 50 kW has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent, while a 5 percent excise duty has been imposed on them.Likewise, the government increased the customs and excise duties on EVs of 50-100 kW by 5 percent. As per the revised tariffs, the customs duty has been increased to 20 percent from 15 percent, while the excise duty has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent.The customs duty on 100-200 kW has been raised to 30 percent from 20 percent. Similarly, those in categories 200-300 kW and more than 300 KW will be subject to customs duty of 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively. In these vehicles, the indirect tax has been raised by 20 percent each.According to EV traders, the market is flooded with various EV models, features, and looks, and customers have options to select according to their needs. They said that EVs ranging from Rs4 million to Rs5.5 million have a large customer base, while high-priced EVs are also seeing good sales.EV traders said that despite the market slowdown, the EV sector has not been affected.“One interesting emerging trend is that people who already own conventional combustion vehicles are also buying EVs,” said Golchha.

And with heavy rainfall in the last few weeks, floods and landslides have disrupted the supply chain. Before spring, the winter drought also reduced the output, vegetable traders say. Vegetable prices have gone up steadily in the past few months. According to the macroeconomic report of Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank, vegetable prices, as measured by the consumer price index, were up 23.11 percent in mid-May.Tomatoes, potatoes, onions, cauliflower, cowpeas, French beans, bitter gourd, smooth gourd, squash, okara, leafy vegetables, button mushrooms, broccoli, lime, chilli green, capsicum, and cucumbers became pricier within a month.Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, the country’s largest vegetable trading centre, said supply of home-grown vegetables had dwindled right from the winter. The shortfall is met with imports, mainly from India.As soon as the monsoon started, flooding and landslides affected the supply system, sending prices high, he added.And there are no signs of the prices falling. “Naturally, vegetable prices rise during the monsoon as rainfall impacts output and supply.”Shrestha said the Kalimati fruits and vegetable market is receiving vegetables in smaller volumes these days.

However, the price of small tomatoes produced in plastic tunnels has declined by 42.17 percent to Rs22.67.Shrestha said tomato prices in the summer fall due to increased production as tunnel farming is not affected by rains, and new farming systems have flourished.On June 18 last year, farmers threw around 90 tonnes of tomatoes on the road outside the Kalimati fruits and vegetable market to vent their anger at the low prices they were getting. The price of tomato big (Nepali) had plummeted to Rs35 per kg.Shrestha expected that the tomato price would not dip any lower.The wholesale price of potato (Indian) increased by 9.94 percent to Rs51.67 per kg.The price of Mude potato, produced in summer in high-altitude places like Mude of Sindhupalchok, increased by 4.08 percent to Rs51 per kg. The average wholesale price of onion (dry) increased by 47.09 percent to Rs97.67 per kg within a month. Vegetable traders said that onion prices have increased due to the Indian export tax policy.In May, India lifted the ban on onion export after nearly five months but imposed a minimum export price of $550 per tonne.The price of cauliflower also increased by 72.73 percent to Rs95 per kg during the review period.

Villagers in the northwestern corner of Nepal bordering Tibet in China where the Humla Karnali crosses face hardships in the absence of one bridge.Though the track was opened to Simkot in mid-April, the construction of the bridge has yet to be completed. As a result, a 12 km section still needs to be completed to connect the district headquarters.Now, vehicles carrying goods along the Karnali Corridor can only reach Kharpu. From there, the goods have to be transported by helicopters and carried over the river using cables, resulting in additional costs. This method, however, is possible only when the water level is low. Due to the lack of a bridge, around ten vehicles bought for government offices and passenger service via Surkhet were taken across the river using ropes and a bulldozer. The cars are now operating on the Simkot side.In 2007-08, the government announced in the annual budget that it would connect Simkot to the national road network. However, even after a decade and a half, Simkot is not connected to the national road network.In September 2021, the joint venture of Swachchhanda, Mount, and Pumori was awarded the Rs110 million contract for the bridge. The construction companies were issued Rs11 million in advance, and the project completion deadline was fixed in March this year.However, the company did not start the construction work for a long time, and around a year ago, it was necessary to change the design.“The joint venture company was responsible for constructing a 55-metre-long motorable truss bridge. But when the contractor started to dig the foundation, a hot water spring was found,” said Bel Bahadur Nepali, chief of the Simikot-Hilsa Road Construction Project. “The assessment showed that the bridge will not be durable if it is constructed on the existing design. So, we made the new design, which got approved two weeks ago. We will start the bridge construction work in July.”Nepali said that with the change in design, the contractor has been given a new deadline to complete the project: August 2025.Binod Kumar Pokharel, chief district officer, said the locals have demanded a Bailey or portable bridge as it may take time to complete the project. “Due to the lack of a bridge, the travellers are facing hassles. The passenger and goods transport charges too are high.”Pokharel said the river's flow is high throughout the year, so vehicles must be towed across the river with the help of an earthmover to Simkot. “To solve the problem, the locals have demanded a Bailey bridge. We are assessing the need.”Until last year, vehicles were operated from Khulalu of Kalikot towards Mugu-Bajura-Sillisalla of Humla. Nepali said that the 39 km road track was opened this year. This year, a 39-kilometre stretch was added. The project opened 8 km of the total track, and the Nepal Army did the work on the remaining 9 km section. The road from Khulalu of Kalikot to the Chinese border is 268 km long. Of this, 95 km south of Simkot is served by transportation. However, as the vehicle flow is breached by the lack of a bridge, passengers from Simkot to Khapunath rural municipality must change the vehicle by crossing suspension bridges on foot.Dan Bahadur Shahi, a senior citizen, said since there is no bridge, vehicles are charging higher fares. Jeeps run on the 12km Simkot-Kharpu stretch. The vehicle operators charge Rs700 to Rs1,000 per person as fare for a special arrangement called “reserve”. In similar fashion, the jeep operated from Kharpu via Sillisalli to Surkhet charges Rs7,000 per person, he said.“We are compelled to change the vehicle as there is no bridge. While crossing the river using the suspension bridge, we need to pay wages to a porter,” Shahi said. “If there were a bridge, we would be able to reach Surkhet by a single vehicle, and the fare would be less.”The price of daily consumable goods in Simkot is sky high, too. “No goods-carriers operate here; small jeeps are permitted to carry passengers only. This means we have to transport goods using porters so the prices refuse to come down,” said Bhim Bahadur Rokaya, a trader at Simkot.“There is no chance of prices falling unless a bridge is constructed across the Kharpu river, allowing for goods to be ferried by trucks,” Rokaya said.Pokharel said that because route permits are issued only from Khulalu of Kalikot to Sillisalli, fares are not fixed. “We have directed the Transport Management Office, Jumla, to manage the route permit and fare. The decision will be taken soon by a meeting of the transportation management committee.” ","summary":"On May 28, presenting the financial plan for the upcoming fiscal year, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said all the 77 districts of the country are now connected by the national road network.But the ground reality is different.Without a bridge over the Karnali river at Chuwa Khola of Kharpunath rural municipality, Simkot, the district headquarters of Humla, remains to be connected to the national road network. Villagers in the northwestern corner of Nepal bordering Tibet in China where the Humla Karnali crosses face hardships in the absence of one bridge.Though the track was opened to Simkot in mid-April, the construction of the bridge has yet to be completed. As a result, a 12 km section still needs to be completed to connect the district headquarters.Now, vehicles carrying goods along the Karnali Corridor can only reach Kharpu. From there, the goods have to be transported by helicopters and carried over the river using cables, resulting in additional costs. This method, however, is possible only when the water level is low.

Along with Kathmandu of Bagmati Province, the outbreak of the deadly disease was reported in several districts of Lumbini, Karnali, Sudurpaschim, Koshi, and Madhesh provinces.And in less than a year of that outbreak, health authorities concerned have been gearing up to declare the entire Madhesh Province fully immunised.“We are all prepared to declare the Madhesh Province fully immunised,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “All the districts of Madhesh Province have been already declared fully covered, and we have decided to declare the province fully immunised.”To declare an area as fully immunised, all children under 15 months old residing there must be administered all vaccines of the routine immunisation programme.Child health experts doubt the claim that all eligible children of the Madhesh Province have been administered the routine vaccines. They say the decision to declare a fully immunised province could raise a sense of complacency in the public, which will ultimately backfire.“Most of the districts across the country have already been declared fully immunised, and the fact is outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, keep getting reported,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Declaration of a fully immunised province could create a sense of complacency in the public. We also declared the entire country open-defecation-free years ago, but outbreaks of waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea and cholera, have not stopped.”Experts say many districts across the country have already been declared fully literate but it’s hard to believe that all the districts are indeed fully literate.“For the last four months, we have been launching extensive vaccination programmes to achieve the target of a fully immunised province,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, chief of the Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “We have also carried out the survey and found 100 percent of children between 15 to 23 months are immunised.”Experts, however, say it is impossible to achieve fully immunised status, as babies are born every hour and every day. Coverage of most health programmes is low in Madhesh Province compared to districts of other provinces. People of certain communities go to maternal homes for child delivery and return months after, and the risk of missing the routine vaccination is high there, according to them.Vaccine coverage is low among people living along the Nepal-India border who keep travelling to India frequently. Most of them opt out of vaccine programmes run by both Nepal and India. Health experts say low vaccination coverage, internal migration, a lack of awareness of importance of vaccines, and government apathy are among the reasons for regular outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.“Due to cross border movements, the trend to go to maternal homes for child delivery, lack of awareness about the importance of vaccination and hygiene and sanitation conditions, risk of children missing routine vaccines is high in Madhesh Province,” said Upreti. “More than the declaration of full immunisation, sustaining that status is very crucial. Childhood vaccination is a continuous process, which never ends, meaning that the target is never achieved.”The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, showed that at least four percent of children aged 12 to 23 months have received no vaccination.The number of children missing basic antigens in the routine immunisation programme in Madhesh Province was also staggering. According to the report, the immunisation coverage rate in Madhesh Province is only 68 percent, which means 32 percent of children in the province didn’t take all the vaccines. It is the lowest of all the seven provinces.The government provides 13 types of vaccines through the national immunisation programme. Gandaki Province has a 93 percent vaccine coverage rate, the highest in the country. The vaccine coverage in Sudurpaschim Province, which is considered less developed and less educated, is 89 percent.The vaccination coverage rate is 81 percent in Koshi, 83 percent in Bagmati, 85 percent in Lumbini, and 84 percent in Karnali Province.Immunisation is considered the most cost-effective and efficient way to control and eliminate vaccine-preventable diseases that contribute to childhood illnesses and deaths.

What concerns public virologists and infectious disease experts in Nepal is that less than one-fifth of cases of influenza-like illnesses are diagnosed, and neither the doctors attending patients nor the authorities concerned bother to know the real cause of ailments. They say that of the swab samples of 8,739 people with an influenza-like illness, only 1,743 tested positive for various kinds of influenza. “The cause of ailments of the rest of people are not known, which should be a cause of serious concern to the researchers as well as policymakers,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “The criteria for collecting the swab samples for influenza test is that patients should have an influenza-like illness, but only less than one-fifth of samples are testing positive for influenza.”The laboratory only maintains a record of the positive cases but does not tell anything about fatalities due to infections. Experts say the number of people infected with influenza could be several times higher than the data provided by the laboratory, as many people suffering from influenza-like illness do not seek treatment. Even for those who do seek treatment, in most cases, the underlying cause of their ailments often remains undiagnosed. “The next pandemic could also be a pandemic of respiratory viruses,” said Pun. “We will not be able to lessen the risk of outbreaks in future if we continue ignoring the risks.

It is far beyond the usual pain and cannot be managed with medication–she’s tried that multiple times. Taking one dose of Meftal (a period pain medication) is never enough. The pain is debilitating most of the time.Despite several visits to gynaecologists, her complaints have been brushed aside as normal period pains. She strongly feels that her pain is abnormal, but feels powerless to address her issues.“The pain is so bad, but I cannot do anything about it,” she says. “I can’t count the number of times that I’ve been told that my debilitating pain is normal,” bemoans Ekta, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy.The normalisation of period pains means serious reproductive conditions like endometriosis often go untreated. People with endometriosis experience severe pelvic pain because tissues like that found outside the uterus grow inside it. Other symptoms of the condition include heavy bleeding during and between periods and fatigue. There is no known cure for this condition, and symptoms can start from the first period onwards.A major challenge experienced by women with endometriosis is the disregard of their symptoms by the public and medical professionals alike. Due to lack of awareness about the debilitating pain typical to endometriosis, both the person suffering from the condition, and their doctors often underestimate their severity.Severe pelvic pain is a key indicator for diagnosing endometriosis, says Dr Reena Shrestha, a gynaecologist at Madhyapur Hospital. When patients seek consultation regarding the kind of severe pain that significantly disrupts their lives, they may undergo two types of tests: transvaginal ultrasound and diagnostic laparoscopy. These procedures are used to determine the presence of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a complex condition, says Dr Hema Pradhan, a consultant gynaecologist at Everest Hospital. Amongst all the patients she meets at her consultations, many frequently turn out to have endometriosis. But, she’s noticed that often patients often delay seeking treatment because period pains are often normalised.“Women who come to me with their symptoms often delay seeking treatment, because, regardless of the severity of their pain, they believe all period pains to be normal,” says Pradhan.Eighteen-year-old Rima (name change) has been struggling with excessive pain before and during periods for years. She also experiences pain while urinating during her periods. Rima has also been diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). The co-occurence of PCOS and endometriosis is not unheard of, although research on them has been minimal.“I can barely walk when I’m on my periods, but I’ve always been told that I should just learn to live with it,” she says.Despite knowing about PCOS, she discovered the possibility of having endometriosis quite later in life. She shares this because period pain, even excessive ones, have been normalised for far too long.The general lack of awareness of endometriosis, and widespread normalisation of period pains, often results in late diagnosis and treatment of the condition.Although there may be no cure to the condition, there are ways to manage its most severe symptoms. Furthermore, receiving a diagnosis can greatly help patients to understand the severity of their condition, according to doctors. “I’m incapable of doing anything during my periods. One time I had to leave the examination in the middle of my exams because of the pain,” says Ekta. “I can’t study, can’t work, all I can do is stay in bed and cry,” she adds.Dr Pradhan reveals another challenging aspect of diagnosing endometriosis. Sometimes the condition may not appear on ultrasound scans initially. Endometrial deposits may appear differently in women due to hormonal changes. Furthermore, symptoms may vary, with some being asymptomatic altogether. According to Dr Shrestha, once a gynaecologist confirms that the patient has endometriosis, they will certainly recommend methods to manage the pain. These include analgesics for pain relief, and home remedies like hot water bag massage.However, the main problem remains. Due to lack of awareness, most patients may only find out about their condition later in life.In some cases women only discover they have endometriosis when they face infertility. Endometriosis is associated with infertility, and 30-50% of people with endometriosis may experience infertility. This also exposes another troubling aspect associated with endometriosis. Ekta shares that her relatives often express concerns about her potential infertility.“They just make me feel bad that I might never get pregnant. And it makes me feel worse,” Ekta adds.Worldwide, endometriosis has been known as a scientifically under-researched condition. It has even been called the ‘missed disease’ because of inconsistencies in its diagnosis and treatment. Endometriosis has also been widely ignored by policy makers.Treatment for endometriosis depends on the individual, says Dr Pradhan. Some are treated with hormonal medication, and others require surgical procedures. The main way to combat endometriosis is timely diagnosis, and timely treatment, she adds.“Raising awareness, timely diagnosis, and treatment are very important,” Dr Pradhan says. ","summary":"Nineteen-year-old Ekta suffers from excruciating pain during her periods. It is far beyond the usual pain and cannot be managed with medication–she’s tried that multiple times. Taking one dose of Meftal (a period pain medication) is never enough. The pain is debilitating most of the time.Despite several visits to gynaecologists, her complaints have been brushed aside as normal period pains. She strongly feels that her pain is abnormal, but feels powerless to address her issues.“The pain is so bad, but I cannot do anything about it,” she says. “I can’t count the number of times that I’ve been told that my debilitating pain is normal,” bemoans Ekta, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy.The normalisation of period pains means serious reproductive conditions like endometriosis often go untreated. People with endometriosis experience severe pelvic pain because tissues like that found outside the uterus grow inside it. Other symptoms of the condition include heavy bleeding during and between periods and fatigue. There is no known cure for this condition, and symptoms can start from the first period onwards.A major challenge experienced by women with endometriosis is the disregard of their symptoms by the public and medical professionals alike. Due to lack of awareness about the debilitating pain typical to endometriosis, both the person suffering from the condition, and their doctors often underestimate their severity.Severe pelvic pain is a key indicator for diagnosing endometriosis, says Dr Reena Shrestha, a gynaecologist at Madhyapur Hospital. When patients seek consultation regarding the kind of severe pain that significantly disrupts their lives, they may undergo two types of tests: transvaginal ultrasound and diagnostic laparoscopy. These procedures are used to determine the presence of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a complex condition, says Dr Hema Pradhan, a consultant gynaecologist at Everest Hospital.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

This gave birth to the idea of Aid for Trade (AfT). The WTO claims that AfT is particularly helpful to the LDCs, which “face a range of supply-side and trade-related infrastructure obstacles which constrain their ability to engage in international trade.” In theory, it mobilises resources to address the trade-related constraints identified by these countries.According to WTO data, $556 billion in AfT was disbursed between 2006 and 2020. AfP’s priority and focus naturally shift with the tide of time. Initially, it focused more on improving trade logistics and enabling small businesses to trade their generally uncompetitive products, wishfully, in developed countries. Now, the weight of the discourse seems to be inclined to climate change issues arising in every knot of the supply chain, the scope of gender equity in sharing trade benefits, and the digital divide as an additional constraint to LDCs when the global trade in both goods and services is being rapidly digitised.Key questionsHas the AfT really helped developing and least-developed countries build their trade capacities and provided the much-needed market share for their goods (and services) in developed countries? The WTO leadership claims that trade (solely?) lifted 1.5 billion people out of abject poverty. It appears as if the global population’s poverty reduction is only because of increased cross-border trade and all the official development assistance received by any poverty-stricken country meant only for trade. Nevertheless, the amount in aggregate disbursement under AfT looks impressive. When it comes to the annual average, it is less than $40 billion a year; when divided among the 137 developing out of 217 economies, the dole out is mere symbolism and not enough to undertake even a single medium-sized project. Forty-five countries are still categorised as LDCs, and 32 are small, landlocked economies like Nepal. When viewed through the challenges faced in accessing trade passage through another sovereign territory, the correlation between their LDC status and landlockedness can’t just be coincidental.For instance, according to the Creditor Reporting System of OECD, Nepal received over $300 million as AfT until 2019. The Enhanced Integrated Framework under the WTO supported the development of the Nepal Trade Integration Strategy (NTIS) to identify the goods with import potential and to conduct several studies like the e-readiness of the businesses. Nepal has developed three versions of the NTIS in the last 15 years—in 2010, 2016 and 2023. The country has increased the list of products and services from 19 to thirty-six. But export trade has only nose-dived over this period, not only in terms of export-import ratio but also in nominal value.Why have we failed in our trade capacity building so badly, and why couldn't all the financial aid flow in support to this end? More importantly, have these international frameworks and support helped developing and least-developed countries excel in balancing their trade in their favour? More often than not, the answer, sadly, is in the negative. Why are LDCs left behind?The 9th Aid for Trade review took place at the WTO headquarters in Geneva in the last week of June. Sessions like “Trade for All” and “Realizing LDCs’ Trade Potential” were also part of the rituals. The reasons for LDCs’ failures may be aplenty, including their inability to set production and trade priorities, bad governance and political instability. However, in the true sense, they are not supported throughout this process. Instead, these voiceless countries are incessantly derided for not doing enough, being reactive, making negativity a survival tactic, and being angry and critical of the Western developed countries for no reason. The reality is different. These essentially neo-colonial narratives are created to cover up the developed countries’ intentions to extend their trade protectionism. They lecture on the developing and poor countries on the perils of climate change while failing to change their own lifestyle and renunciating their luxuries, even partially. Such annual rituals, even publications, highlight achievements that hardly reflect ground reality in the countries concerned; instead, feigned diplomatic niceties rule the roost.Contentious issues like the possibility of the supply chain being destroyed by the Russia-Ukraine war, the trade wars between the major trade partners in the world, like the US and China and India and China, and their gross violations of global trade rules, are hardly discussed in detail. The discussion on peripheral issues chosen by “experienced” consultants makes it easy to evade truly excruciating issues. Underdeveloped and developing countries are instructed to transform into a green economy. But the governments and citizens of developed countries who are using air conditioners, refrigerators and fossil fuel vehicles on a mammoth scale are not ready to give up their lifestyles. The underdeveloped world, which consumes only a very small part of it, is held guilty. The developed countries have no intention of reducing major carbon emissions, and it looks impossible given their consumption patterns. Seventy percent of the electricity consumed by developed countries comes from coal, diesel and petrol plants. Air travel and cargo shipment are unlikely to be replaced by green energy for the next several decades.There is nothing for least-developed countries to sell in the competitive global trade. They cannot be expected to produce and sell high-quality, refined and high-value-low volume goods. They can sell either agricultural products or primary or secondary raw materials. It can never be a profitable and sustainable trade. Lately, organic products have suddenly become the import priority of developed countries. But have chemical fertilisers and pesticides been explored and diffused by developing countries? The production system of the developing world became dependent on harmful fertilisers and pesticides produced and aggressively traded by the developed countries. How, then, will these agriculture-based economies trade with new phyto-sanitation and other rules?Worst of all, the West has monopolised the knowledge products, knowledge systems and discourses related to the trade vulnerability of the LDCs. This has created a significant barrier even for a dispassionate debate on it. The LDCs are once again at the receiving end of the so-called global system—trade. ","summary":"It has been 20 years since the 2005 Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting recognised that developing and, mainly, least developed countries (LDCs) cannot meaningfully participate in the global trading system as envisaged while establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO) without “some kind of support” to enhance their trade capacity. This gave birth to the idea of Aid for Trade (AfT). The WTO claims that AfT is particularly helpful to the LDCs, which “face a range of supply-side and trade-related infrastructure obstacles which constrain their ability to engage in international trade.” In theory, it mobilises resources to address the trade-related constraints identified by these countries.According to WTO data, $556 billion in AfT was disbursed between 2006 and 2020. AfP’s priority and focus naturally shift with the tide of time. Initially, it focused more on improving trade logistics and enabling small businesses to trade their generally uncompetitive products, wishfully, in developed countries. Now, the weight of the discourse seems to be inclined to climate change issues arising in every knot of the supply chain, the scope of gender equity in sharing trade benefits, and the digital divide as an additional constraint to LDCs when the global trade in both goods and services is being rapidly digitised.Key questionsHas the AfT really helped developing and least-developed countries build their trade capacities and provided the much-needed market share for their goods (and services) in developed countries? The WTO leadership claims that trade (solely?) lifted 1.5 billion people out of abject poverty. It appears as if the global population’s poverty reduction is only because of increased cross-border trade and all the official development assistance received by any poverty-stricken country meant only for trade. Nevertheless, the amount in aggregate disbursement under AfT looks impressive. When it comes to the annual average, it is less than $40 billion a year; when divided among the 137 developing out of 217 economies, the dole out is mere symbolism and not enough to undertake even a single medium-sized project. Forty-five countries are still categorised as LDCs, and 32 are small, landlocked economies like Nepal. When viewed through the challenges faced in accessing trade passage through another sovereign territory, the correlation between their LDC status and landlockedness can’t just be coincidental.For instance, according to the Creditor Reporting System of OECD, Nepal received over $300 million as AfT until 2019. The Enhanced Integrated Framework under the WTO supported the development of the Nepal Trade Integration Strategy (NTIS) to identify the goods with import potential and to conduct several studies like the e-readiness of the businesses. Nepal has developed three versions of the NTIS in the last 15 years—in 2010, 2016 and 2023. The country has increased the list of products and services from 19 to thirty-six. But export trade has only nose-dived over this period, not only in terms of export-import ratio but also in nominal value.Why have we failed in our trade capacity building so badly, and why couldn't all the financial aid flow in support to this end? More importantly, have these international frameworks and support helped developing and least-developed countries excel in balancing their trade in their favour? More often than not, the answer, sadly, is in the negative. Why are LDCs left behind?The 9th Aid for Trade review took place at the WTO headquarters in Geneva in the last week of June. Sessions like “Trade for All” and “Realizing LDCs’ Trade Potential” were also part of the rituals. The reasons for LDCs’ failures may be aplenty, including their inability to set production and trade priorities, bad governance and political instability. However, in the true sense, they are not supported throughout this process. Instead, these voiceless countries are incessantly derided for not doing enough, being reactive, making negativity a survival tactic, and being angry and critical of the Western developed countries for no reason. The reality is different. These essentially neo-colonial narratives are created to cover up the developed countries’ intentions to extend their trade protectionism. They lecture on the developing and poor countries on the perils of climate change while failing to change their own lifestyle and renunciating their luxuries, even partially. Such annual rituals, even publications, highlight achievements that hardly reflect ground reality in the countries concerned; instead, feigned diplomatic niceties rule the roost.Contentious issues like the possibility of the supply chain being destroyed by the Russia-Ukraine war, the trade wars between the major trade partners in the world, like the US and China and India and China, and their gross violations of global trade rules, are hardly discussed in detail. The discussion on peripheral issues chosen by “experienced” consultants makes it easy to evade truly excruciating issues. Underdeveloped and developing countries are instructed to transform into a green economy. But the governments and citizens of developed countries who are using air conditioners, refrigerators and fossil fuel vehicles on a mammoth scale are not ready to give up their lifestyles. The underdeveloped world, which consumes only a very small part of it, is held guilty. The developed countries have no intention of reducing major carbon emissions, and it looks impossible given their consumption patterns. Seventy percent of the electricity consumed by developed countries comes from coal, diesel and petrol plants. Air travel and cargo shipment are unlikely to be replaced by green energy for the next several decades.There is nothing for least-developed countries to sell in the competitive global trade. They cannot be expected to produce and sell high-quality, refined and high-value-low volume goods. They can sell either agricultural products or primary or secondary raw materials. It can never be a profitable and sustainable trade. Lately, organic products have suddenly become the import priority of developed countries. But have chemical fertilisers and pesticides been explored and diffused by developing countries? The production system of the developing world became dependent on harmful fertilisers and pesticides produced and aggressively traded by the developed countries. How, then, will these agriculture-based economies trade with new phyto-sanitation and other rules?Worst of all, the West has monopolised the knowledge products, knowledge systems and discourses related to the trade vulnerability of the LDCs. This has created a significant barrier even for a dispassionate debate on it. The LDCs are once again at the receiving end of the so-called global system—trade.

This has continued for ages, and with a changing climate, it is likely to increase. We can’t stop monsoons from entering our territory, nor do we want to; they are the lifeline of Nepal’s agriculture, food security, biodiversity, water recharge and many more. We can’t modify its onset, spread and intensity. However, we would be keenly interested in knowing about its arrival, its impacts, its impact area, and its victims. The progress in hydromet science allows us to forecast rainy days, hot days, cold days and many other hydromet phenomena with reasonable spatial and temporal accuracy. When combined or overlaid with exposure and vulnerabilities (poverty, house structures, settlement locations, etc.), forecasts can tell us who will be affected the most, where and when. This is possible through “impact-based forecast” (IBF). So, why not use this knowledge and gear ourselves up to act whenever we have such information? Well, things have already begun, and it’s time to mainstream this approach to managing disaster risks. The “anticipation or anticipatory action” approach entails acting ahead of predicted hazards to prevent or reduce acute humanitarian impacts before they fully unfold. Anticipatory action, as such, is an integral part of disaster risk management, and it systematically links forecast information to actions that can help reduce disaster impacts and protect lives and livelihoods. When you have credible information about a hazard with its occurrence (time and location) reasonably known, there cannot be any excuse for inaction. Since there are now reasonably accurate forecasts of many natural hazards, it is a matter of using forecast science and information in decision-making. Anticipatory action (AA) is yet to be fully integrated into risk management policies and practices in many countries. However, the intention is to make it an integral part of Disaster Risk Management (DRM) thinking and practice. Some operational challenges and “perceived” difficulties are associated with its integration. Here, I discuss some of those challenges in Nepal’s context. First and foremost is the complexity of the narrative itself. Therefore, the first step is to simply demystify the narrative of anticipation—what it means and doesn’t. In Nepal, anticipatory action was first introduced as “forecast-based financing” (in 2015-16), where rainfall forecasts from the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology were used to inform and prepare organisations to respond better and quicker to looming floods. Somewhere during 2016-17, some of the Disaster Preparedness and Response Plans (DPRPs) and the national DRR Strategic Plan of Action also tried to incorporate anticipation. Nevertheless, those initiatives remained ephemeral as they were marred with classical problems of being supply-driven and top-down and needing more compelling evidence. Furthermore, there was little investment in clarifying the approach, follow-up and communication, as well as strengthening capacities and building systems. Second, to a larger extent, AA has been siloed within non-state actors (mainly with the I/NGOs, UN and donors) and has been limited to small-scale “pilots”. Though the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) is now taking it up, it has not yet been systematically integrated into the government's disaster risk management thinking and practice. Nepal needs a government-led process that brings actors together to agree on an operational framework, harmonise the approach, charter a pathway and milestones, and reinforce mutual accountability. NDRRMA should encourage actors to get out of their “minuscule pilots” and facilitate bigger and scalable impacts. In the meantime, the actors/stakeholders should join hands to support the government in developing and implementing plans for anticipation at scale for different hazards. The obsession with quick wins and tangible results is another classical problem facing many donor-funded initiatives; AA is no exception. While such pursuits are soothing and pleasing, they do not always produce durable and sustainable solutions. Therefore, the donors must emphasise “building/strengthening systems” for anticipatory action through what they call the “build money”. The government needs to strengthen the systems, capacity and infrastructure for the governments to use weather forecasts as decision-support information. Meanwhile, the donor priority for anticipatory action mustn't crowd out funding for long-term preparedness, risk reduction and resilience building. Anticipatory action can be implemented at scale only through a robust disaster risk management system. Sustainable funding for implementing anticipatory action should ideally come from the local and provincial governments. While the federal government, donors and non-state actors can support strengthening systems and capacities, the “fuel money” should come from the local governments, allowing for the implementation of anticipatory actions for imminent threats. The policy and legislative interventions/reforms should empower governments to earmark a portion of their coffer to act ex-ante and release funds for anticipatory actions based on the imminent threat of a hazard. This is not technical and administrative but rather political; it requires bold decisions, innovation and accountability.  ","summary":"Summer has had its time, and monsoon mayhem will make headlines for the next few months.

My interaction with Janesh Bhandari, a local civic campaigner, revealed the unfortunate stagnation of a once-promising project. Funded by the Italian government with approximately 1.4 million Euros allocated for Kathmandu, Dolpa and Bajura, this project saw half of the funds directed to Bajura alone. Preliminary research identified that out of 28 species planted, 24 bore fruit, and 10 were recommended for Nepal.Following the success of the pilot study, the Government of Nepal (GoN) has designated Bajura, encompassing the municipalities of Jagannath, Himali, Swamikartik and Budhinanda, as an olive zone. In 2016, an Olive Zone Implementation Unit was established under the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernisation (2015-25) Project. The main goal of this unit is to promote commercial olive farming and enhance the management and utilisation of natural olive forests to increase farmers’ incomes. Despite such significant investment in research, commercial olive farming remains unfruitful, owing to several challenges.ProspectsEmpirical evidence suggests that olive farming in Bajura could serve as a nature-based solution to diversify the local production system. Investing in both wild and domesticated olives could boost household incomes and generate employment in the region. Given the environmental, social and economic benefits, olive cultivation could enhance the resilience and well-being of smallholding farmers. Research also highlights olive as a crop with a high potential for income, employment opportunities and improvement in economic status.Olive oil is a common product in Nepal, but olive wood handicrafts are globally popular. Handicraft items from olive wood fetch high prices, including wooden bowls and plates, which sell at a range of $20-70. Olive oil is also used in producing soaps, scents, skincare and other cosmetics. Nepal imported olive products worth $616,217 in 2022, which shows a year-on-year value growth of 70.38 percent. With olive oil prices in the Nepali market ranging from Rs2,000 to 3,000 per litre, the market potential for olive oil and its diversified products is substantial, making systematic cultivation a promising avenue for import substitution. The Prime Minister's Agriculture Modernisation Project has initiated a programme to construct infrastructure for olive farming and provide relief of Rs427,000 for 2,386 farmers in Bajura.ChallengesDespite Bajura being designated as an olive production zone, several challenges hinder the commercial farming of olives. One major issue is the underutilisation of wild olives due to the lack of collection and processing centres. In addition to these, another challenge was the lack of a three-phase electricity line essential for the production centre's operation, rendering the plant dysfunctional at the moment.Additionally, there is a significant mindset barrier among farmers and local people. Olive trees take five years to bear fruit, and most farmers attracted to faster-yielding crops like apples are reluctant to invest in olive cultivation. The farmers’ economic status exacerbates this reluctance, as they cannot afford to wait for such a long harvest period.Another challenge is the lack of a technically skilled workforce. Some farmers have fallen short of the necessary knowledge about olive cultivation and its benefits, and others have shifted to high-value crops, abandoning traditional farming practices in the region. Educating them about the economic and health benefits of olive farming could prove beneficial. Policy measuresNepal can draw inspiration from Rajasthan, India, where the government actively promoted olive cultivation by introducing Israeli technology and operational models. The Government of India included olives under the national mission on oilseeds and oil palm. After eight years of nurturing olive saplings, this led to the successful launch of Rajasthan's first indigenous olive oil brand. Similarly, Pakistan has seen impressive success in olive farming. In 2022, the country exported virgin and extra virgin olive oil worth $1.9 million. This achievement was enabled by a project launched in 2012 by the Pakistani government, in cooperation with the Italian government, called \"Promotion of Olive Cultivation for Economic Development and Poverty Alleviation\". This project, run through the Pakistan Agriculture Research Council (PARC), has provided Pakistani farmers with training on pruning techniques and technological support. As a result, Italy and Pakistan now enjoy an annual trade relationship worth €2 billion.With the government initiating an olive zone, it is now crucial for local authorities to take ownership of the project and explore the commercial viability of olive oil extraction. Currently, only a few informed individuals at the policy level are aware of the prospects. Disseminating information to local farmers and communities is imperative, as olive is not a part of Nepal's traditional lifestyle and food habits. The government should implement policy measures such as incorporating olive farming into the curriculum of universities and schools. Agricultural universities should encourage students to intern in olive farming regions for practical experience.Once commercial farming is established, Nepal should register with the International Olive Council to gain wider recognition. Agricultural documents should highlight olives as prospective crops, and proper national records should be maintained on the status of wild and commercially farmed olives. Additionally, it is essential to have trained technicians and experts to oversee olive cultivation and farming. With coordinated action from the government, local officials, farmers and other key stakeholders, olive cultivation could become a lucrative endeavour in Nepal. This could help diversify the country's agriculture sector and foster economic development.

In order to make the federal system work, ways must be found to bridge the troubling mismatch between the expectations of employees of vital institutions and the incentives on offer.  "},{"hash":"d9a6663ac3767f0cf7db6acede74f5cfecafaa8184031264c175f3398397f84b","title":"sea-change-needed-in-see","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/06/28/sea-change-needed-in-see","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/thumb6-1719462319.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1719532800000,"source":"kp","category":"editorial","content":"The famed “iron gate” called the Secondary Education Examinations has closed for 242,313 students, as 52.14 percent of the examinees failed to secure any grades, being categorised as non-graded.

Assange, now 51, stepped into freedom outside of an American court in the US Pacific island territory of Saipan on Wednesday after pleading guilty to a criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified defence documents. As he was sentenced to time he had already served in prison, he was allowed to head home to Australia.Assange’s freedom has come as a relief to his supporters across the globe, especially so for those who value the disclosures made by the company he founded, WikiLeaks. In November 2010, WikiLeaks had released over 250,000 US diplomatic cables with the help of Chelsea Manning, a former US army soldier who was convicted under the US Espionage Act and had her sentence commuted by President Barack Obama. The WikiLeaks exposed, among other things, the fact that the US forces in Baghdad had killed 11 people in a 2007 helicopter attack; criticism of the UK’s military operation in Afghanistan by US commanders and the Afghan president; and thousands of US diplomatic cables that revealed how the US used its embassies for espionage. In 2016, WikiLeaks again came to prominence after exposing thousands of hacked emails of the Democratic National Committee, causing a possible setback for the US Democratic Party presidential candidate Hilary Clinton. WikiLeaks was then accused of collaborating with the Russian government to influence the US presidential elections, which Donald Trump, Clinton’s opponent, won.Shaken by the incriminating revelations on their modus operandi, Western nations, led by the US, launched an all-out war against Assange and WikiLeaks. Assange’s global legitimacy took a hit after Sweden’s abortive attempt to prosecute him for sexual allegations and the Ecuadorian Embassy’s allegation of rude behaviour while staying with them as a refugee-guest. Beyond the questions of his personal conduct, though, Assange continued to be considered a victim of the Western world’s crusade against the free press. Assange found his champions, among other global intellectuals, in Noam Chomsky and Arundhati Roy, both of whom condemned the US government’s anti-democratic attempts at silencing a journalist-crusader. In a strange turn of events, Roy, Indian writer known for speaking on behalf of the freedom of the country’s impoverished Adivasis and Dalits, now faces sedition charges in her home country for a speech she made in 2010. The hounding of Roy is a clear case of the Indian government, led by the right-wing strongman Narendra Modi, silencing dissenting voices. In Nepal, Kailash Sirohiya, the publisher of The Kathmandu Post, spent nine days in jail last month and continues to face prosecution for an alleged forgery of citizenship certificates while in reality, he is being hounded for his publication’s consistent coverage of the corruption allegations against Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane. The abuse of authority to silence journalists, intellectuals and dissenters is a global phenomenon today.

The National Examination Board had enforced the ‘non-graded’ category from this year. The underperformance of the majority of school students has stirred a fresh debate about the test system. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former National Planning Commission member Usha Jha, who led the committee that recommended the government to adopt the letter grading system.How do you analyse the SEE results published on Thursday?People have reacted to it with shock, not me. In fact, on the basis of the teaching system that is being practised in our schools, I think the results are good. We get the results based on what and how we teach students. Over 52 percent of students have been categorised as non-graded. We need to identify and address the causes behind the bad results. I have heard some people blame the letter grading system. This is wrong. A form of letter grading system was already there. We only suggested an upgraded form of the system. If we start blaming the system, we won’t find the real cause of the problem. What may be the real causes that you are hinting at?The first is the poor quality of teachers in our country. A form of letter grading system was there even before. But it had two loopholes. First, the government took an approach whereby all students would pass. That gave an impression to the students that they don’t need to study hard. That degraded the quality of their education. Second, there was a system of giving marks based on the students’ performances in theoretical and practical exams. Of the total 100 marks, the practical exams made up 35 marks. Most students were given maximum marks in the practical exams. That helped them get higher grades even if they didn’t do well in theoretical exams. This system encouraged students to neglect theoretical studies. That has caused huge damage to our education system. The letter grade system introduced this year has closed those loopholes. But the letter grading system requires a learning environment. The system was introduced without adequate preparation for its effective implementation. Also, the Covid pandemic disturbed preparatory works at the time. We should have drastically improved classroom teaching practices, and trained teachers across the country because their teaching methods are outdated. They weren’t trained on the grading system. They give lectures and encourage students to memorise while the letter grading system requires a thorough process and encourages result-oriented learning. It doesn’t prioritise marks. Our teachers and schools lacked the capacity to implement the new system. Teachers weren’t trained and prepared. Even now, most teachers don’t know what the letter grading system is. The system is necessary to make our students compete in global markets.While we upgraded the system, we didn’t upgrade the schools and teachers. Our teachers engage only in routine and formal responsibilities such as completing textbook courses before the examinations. This system should be properly internalised not only by teachers and students but also school management, palikas [local units] and parents of the students. Only then can it be effectively implemented. These are the major reasons behind the poor results. How is the students’ performance evaluated in the letter grading system?First, teachers should study a lot. They take reference of the subject matter from the textbook and teach students giving a broader perspective of the matter. They have to engage the students practically on the issue. The students should be regularly evaluated based on their participation and response in study and activities. The teachers should teach them and constantly monitor whether they are learning and making progress. The marking should be based on that. So, in this system, the examination starts from day 1 and everyday activities contribute to their marks. It also takes other activities such as behaviour, understanding, presentation into consideration. Therefore, it is called a regular assessment system based on a thorough process, unlike the traditional three-hour-long yearly examination method. If the teachers aren’t competent to carry out these activities, this idea can’t yield good results. They badly need capacity enhancement. The pedagogy should be remodelled.What was the rationale behind the decision to implement this system?One reason was to upgrade our education’s standard on par with the international standards and make our students fit for global markets. In the course of formulating this policy, we undertook a comprehensive research of international practices. Based on that evidence-based research, we submitted a report to then education minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. The government studied and endorsed it. Basically, this system was introduced with an objective of upgrading our education system in the changed context. But we lacked preparations to implement this idea.We will make a mistake if we change this system. I heard that the education minister [Sumana Shrestha] decided to make some changes in the policy and allow all non-graded students to sit for chance examinations, whereas the system says only those students who secured non-grades in two subjects can retake exams for the same subjects. There is no point in changing the method to favour even the students who have failed in all the subjects. She should have made it clear what factors made her change the criteria overnight. I cannot understand why the minister made the decision in a haste without considering its impact.In fact, our next step should have been capacity enhancement of teachers. The minister took some right decisions such as separating teachers from political parties. But an incumbent minister changing a system that was implemented by a previous minister would cause a problem. She could have formed a panel to conduct a study to find if the letter grading system is the main cause behind the students’ underperformance. But changing a policy through an order didn’t look good.Results show our students are very poor in mathematics, science and English. What could be the reasons?This is unfortunate. We saw similar trends in previous years as well. Mathematics and science are becoming more challenging. One reason is the lack of sufficient teachers for these subjects. Also, some teachers are under-utilised. Some teachers don’t go to the schools. So special measures need to be taken to manage teachers mainly for these subjects. Otherwise, we will have similar results in the coming years.The committee under your leadership recommended that those getting a GPA below 1.6 have to choose technical courses and those willing to study Grade 11 must score above 1.6 GPA. What was the idea behind that recommendation?The idea was to end the situation of halting students’ study and activities because of their lower grades. We have a government body in the form of the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) which has been offering dozens of vocational training based on the needs and interests of people. So our youths can join a suitable CTEVT course. We need more people in vocational fields. Skilled people aren’t available in the country. A large number of people working in technical fields in Nepal are from India. We included the provision in consultation with CTEVT officials. Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel had also prepared a broad plan to implement the letter grading system and integrate the vocational part in our education system. The present government should improve the education system by enhancing teachers’ capacity and encouraging youths to join vocational training to fill the gaps in the employment market. Are the infrastructure and resources available in our education system sufficient to implement the grading system?Some schools lack even essential resources while in some we find misuse or underuse of resources. So, our education ministry should carry out a comprehensive mapping and find where teachers are required, where they are underutilised and where they are idle. Then, the government can make optimum use of the teachers and make additional investment on need-basis. Such an approach will yield better results. In general, our academic institutions lack resources as there is a trend of allocating insufficient budgets for the education sector. Yes, the letter grading system needs more investment. We have to work on teachers’ capacity enhancement and to provide learning materials to students. When you make an activity participatory, you certainly need resources and investments.Do we need to review our teacher recruitment process and our pedagogy in the universities that produce teachers?The government can consider new requirements while recruiting teachers and train them accordingly. Also, we need to update our curriculum and pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. I have doubts about the quality of our graduates, post-graduates and even PhD holders due to the poor teaching and learning environment of our academic institutions. There is a need for more coordination and collaboration between the government and universities to address such issues.In the end, I want to stress that the government should adopt a clear and consistent policy and avoid ad-hoc decisions. The letter grading system is the best and we should push for that despite the challenges in its implementation. Just that it should have been enforced after enhancing teachers’ capacity. The problems we have now are due to lack of preparation. ","summary":"In the Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) conducted this year, over 52 percent of students failed to graduate to grade 11.

What are the takeaways of the prime minister’s Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government’s decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country’s foreign policy doesn’t change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government’s priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn’t it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn’t affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country’s ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person’s affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn’t seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister’s New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister’s visit doesn’t reflect any misgivings about the government’s decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn’t reflect that. Why aren’t we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country’s views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don’t see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats’ relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don’t get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country’s influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let’s move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister’s level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister’s emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal’s official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister’s Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report’s submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India’s facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour’s support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India’s infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal’s electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven’t developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don’t envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn’t the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects—domestic as well as international use—of the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It’s been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why haven’t we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon. ","summary":"The government’s recent decision to recall ambassadors, particularly Nepal’s envoy to India, just ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to New Delhi, courted widespread controversy. What are the takeaways of the prime minister’s Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government’s decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country’s foreign policy doesn’t change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government’s priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn’t it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn’t affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations.

However, opposition members believe that the investigation will be conducted fairly and impartially.\n\nOpposition members will challenge any biased decisions made by the committee and may issue their own report if necessary.\n\nThe committee's investigation and findings will influence the next steps in the case, including the possibility of Lamichhane's resignation or action against other individuals involved in the scam.","summary":"A parliamentary committee was formed to investigate a cooperative scam, with a task force led by Jiban Pariyar finalizing its terms of reference after extensive negotiations, despite resistance from the ruling parties to include Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane's name in the investigation's scope."},{"hash":"a7ff341d1e89ccc5de6ae13da5ade6065a7cfb6087ede960cfcd8b1ac8aa0047","title":"**Today's Weather for July 2, 2024**","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/weather/2024/07/02/today-s-weather-july-2-2024","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/thumb3-1719887336.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1719878400000,"source":"kp","category":"weather","content":"**Tuesday:**\n\n* Cloudy with rain and thunderstorms\n* Heavy rain in parts of Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudur Pashchim\n* Carry an umbrella\n\n**Tuesday Night:**\n\n* Mostly cloudy\n* Light to moderate rain with thunderstorms\n* Heavy rain possible in isolated areas\n* Risk of very heavy rain in Gandaki and Lumbini Provinces\n\n**Temperature:**\n\n* Hottest: 35.8 degrees Celsius in Dhangadi and Dipayal\n* Coldest: 18.4 degrees Celsius in Jiri","summary":"Rain with thunder and lightning is anticipated Tuesday, with heavy rainfall in several Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudur Pashchim provinces, while one or two locations in Gandaki and Lumbini may experience very heavy rainfall."},{"hash":"0cdd53516bef91c44af16dd758dec58a087133f52f9bb3cae4a8c047fcb60d25","title":"**Today's Weather Forecast for July 1, 2024**","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/weather/2024/07/01/today-s-weather-july-1-2024","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/thumb1-1719801651.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1719792000000,"source":"kp","category":"weather","content":"**Weather Forecast for Monday:**\n\n* Mostly cloudy across the country.\n* Light to moderate rain with thunderstorms in some areas.\n* Heavy rainfall possible in parts of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudur Pashchim Provinces.\n\n**Warnings:**\n\n* Very heavy rainfall expected in Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki Provinces.\n* Extremely heavy rainfall possible in Koshi and Gandaki Provinces tonight.\n\n**Temperature Extremes:**\n\n* Highest temperature: 35.3°C in Dhangadi.\n* Lowest temperature: 14.5°C in Jomsom.","summary":"Expect cloudy weather with light to moderate rain, thunderstorms, and potential heavy rainfall in Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudur Pashchim Provinces, with warnings issued for very heavy rainfall in some areas."},{"hash":"64126b6b3669ef106532ac99ac3d2be8704db11d84e9f19362375a08cf612933","title":"**Today's Weather (June 30, 2024)**","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/weather/2024/06/30/today-s-weather-june-30-2024","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/thumb1-1719713854.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1719705600000,"source":"kp","category":"weather","content":"**Weather Forecast:**\n\n* **Sunday:** Cloudy, light to moderate rain with thunderstorms in Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudurpashchim.
