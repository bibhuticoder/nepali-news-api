Moreover, he said he was positive towards removing the European Union's ban on Nepali airlines from flying over the EU's sky.\nPresident Paudel's visit to Germany is the first visit at the Head of the State level from Nepal to Germany since 1986.\nEarlier, President Paudel observed a Guard of Honour accorded to him by the government of Germany.\nPresident Paudel reached Germany on June 15 after completing the visit to Switzerland.

But four months down the line, Dahal has taken no step towards implementing his commitment, prompting the provinces to exert pressure on the federal government.“The federal system will be incomplete so long as the provinces don’t have their own police force and civil servants,” Bimala Ansari, internal affairs minister in Madhesh Province, told the Post. “The provinces are fed up with the hollow commitments. Once the budget endorsement process is complete, we will be in Kathmandu to demand our constitutional rights.”Ansari said she is in talks with the internal affairs ministers from other provinces and all have agreed to jointly put forward their demands before the federal government in the next two to three weeks. Discussions on the budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 continue in all the provinces. Dinesh Panthi, internal affairs minister in Lumbini Province, said it is unfortunate that the provinces haven’t got to exercise their constitutional authority even after seven years since the provincial governments were first formed. “Implementation of the constitution is the responsibility as well as the liability of the federal government,” Panthi told the Post. “I don’t think there is any further justification to delay the adjustment of the police force.”Successive governments have ignored the provinces’ repeated calls to adjust the police force at the provincial level and promulgate the federal civil service law. To build pressure on Kathmandu, the Madhesh provincial assembly unanimously endorsed a resolution motion on December 6 last year, stating that provinces should be allowed to exercise all the authorities delegated to them by Schedule 6 of the Constitution of Nepal.Led by Saroj Yadav, then chief minister, a team comprising leaders from all the parties presented the resolution motion to Dahal on December 10. Back then, Dahal had sought two weeks to resolve the matter. But he never acted on his commitment.Schedule 6 of the Constitution of Nepal lists 21 exclusive authorities of the provincial governments. Maintaining law and order and having its own provincial police is the first authority on the list. Article 268 (2) also states that each province will have its own police force. Likewise, Clause 3 of the Article says matters relating to the operation, supervision and coordination of functions to be discharged by the Nepal Police and the provincial police shall be as provided for in the federal law.The federal parliament in 2019 endorsed the Police Personnel Adjustment Act and the Act to Govern the Operation, Supervision and Coordination of Nepal Police and Provincial Police Forces. Similarly, all the provinces have endorsed their respective provincial police laws to clear legal hurdles in overseeing their police forces. However, they cannot set up police forces unless the federal government adjusts the existing police force at the provincial level. This has to happen as per the Act endorsed by Parliament in 2019.The Police Personnel Adjustment Act authorises the federal government to assign a deputy inspector general of Nepal Police to serve as provincial police chief. The federal government can transfer such police officers to other provinces or any department of Nepal Police in consultation with the concerned provincial governments.However, in case of other personnel adjusted to provincial police forces, the relevant provincial official can transfer such personnel to any police unit in the province. Ignoring repeated demands of the provinces, successive federal governments have hesitated to implement the Police Personnel Adjustment Act.Similarly, provincial governments have not been able to recruit civil servants either because Kathmandu has yet to promulgate a federal civil service law.“Securing our constitutional authority will be our sole focus once the budget gets through the provincial assembly,” Ansari, the Madhesh minister, said. “We are ready to go to any extent to do so.” ","summary":"Provincial internal affairs ministers plan to pressure the federal government to implement constitutional provisions granting provinces their own police forces and civil servants due to the government's inaction on the matter."},{"hash":"cab6a0199831bcc89d4e32420972b93affc26b5264f7626d85f0d010077a5d29","title":"Socialist leaders are discussing a leadership plan where everyone makes decisions together.

However, many Nepalis feel their government is indifferent to household struggles to secure enough food, leading some to seek better opportunities abroad. There is a growing concern that the budget formulation process and fund allocation lack public participation, which raises questions about transparency and democratic accountability. This sentiment, particularly resonant among the youth, underscores broader global discontent with governance decisions that affect citizens’ lives. As cities and municipalities worldwide explore diverse approaches to address these issues, Nepal must shed its 18th-century mindset and take proactive steps.Participatory budgetingA wave of participatory policy reforms has emerged worldwide, offering remedies to make democracy more functional and inclusive. Facilitated by advancements in internet and smartphone technology, as well as democratic experimentation, these reforms aim to rejuvenate democracy by fostering inclusive governance and civic engagement. At the forefront of these efforts is participatory budgeting, empowering citizens to identify community needs, collaborate with elected officials to formulate budget proposals and vote on the allocation of public funds.Such budgeting represents democratic governance and captures widespread attention for its transformative potential in enhancing citizen engagement and advancing social justice within public finance.

However, many Nepalis feel their government is indifferent to household struggles to secure enough food, leading some to seek better opportunities abroad. There is a growing concern that the budget formulation process and fund allocation lack public participation, which raises questions about transparency and democratic accountability. This sentiment, particularly resonant among the youth, underscores broader global discontent with governance decisions that affect citizens’ lives. As cities and municipalities worldwide explore diverse approaches to address these issues, Nepal must shed its 18th-century mindset and take proactive steps.Participatory budgetingA wave of participatory policy reforms has emerged worldwide, offering remedies to make democracy more functional and inclusive. Facilitated by advancements in internet and smartphone technology, as well as democratic experimentation, these reforms aim to rejuvenate democracy by fostering inclusive governance and civic engagement. At the forefront of these efforts is participatory budgeting, empowering citizens to identify community needs, collaborate with elected officials to formulate budget proposals and vote on the allocation of public funds.Such budgeting represents democratic governance and captures widespread attention for its transformative potential in enhancing citizen engagement and advancing social justice within public finance. It has evolved into a global phenomenon, catalysing democratic decision-making processes surrounding the allocation of public funds within local communities.Participatory budgeting embodies fundamental principles of deliberative democracy, social equity and citizen empowerment.

There was increasing bipartisan support in both the Australian parliament and the US Congress for the Australian citizen’s release. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has made repeated statements on his behalf, and in April, US President Joe Biden said he was “considering” a request from Australia to drop its prosecution of Assange.This all contributed to the sense the matter might be resolved before Assange’s final UK hearing date, previously scheduled for July 9 and 10. The timing of the deal is also a welcome prelude to Albanese’s potential visit to Washington in early July.The United States’ pursuit of Assange has seemingly been relentless since WikiLeaks posted hundreds of thousands of classified military documents in 2010. It wasn’t until 2019 under then President Donald Trump, however, that he was finally indicted on 17 counts of violating the 1917 Espionage Act.The charges against Assange were not just considered unprecedented, they raised significant First Amendment concerns.The apparent desire to punish Assange for the embarrassment caused by the leaks—and to deter others from taking similar action—was so strong the CIA allegedly discussed plans to kidnap and even assassinate Assange during the Trump administration, according to US media reports.In the UK courts, the US Department of Justice had argued Assange should be subject to US law and extradited to face trial for his actions. However, as a non-citizen, there were questions over whether he could rely on the legal protections afforded by those same laws—particularly the constitutional right to free speech.The successful extradition of Assange could have set a precedent by which the US could pursue journalists anywhere in the world for publishing information it did not like, while potentially denying them their fundamental First Amendment rights.In a crucial election year in the US that President Joe Biden is framing as an existential fight for the soul of US democracy, the continued pursuit of Assange was as inconsistent as it was ultimately untenable. Viewed from the outside, it appeared the case was causing the Biden administration international embarrassment.Biden has been careful to maintain an appropriate distance between the presidency and the Department of Justice. He came into office promising to restore faith in the rule of law following the Trump years and has meticulously avoided any appearance of interference in the department’s work as it has investigated and indicted his predecessor.Assange’s case, however, is wholly different to the charges on which Trump has been indicted. It is certainly possible to interpret Biden’s comment that he was “considering” dropping the charges as a gentle public rebuke of the Department of Justice’s pursuit of the case, given its global implications for a free press.The continued pursuit of Assange was also becoming problematic in the context of Australia’s alliance with the US. That relationship is always described as one based on shared democratic values, in contrast to what Biden has repeatedly framed as the coercive and repressive instincts of “authoritarian” powers.The decision by the US to pursue a citizen of one of its closest allies for the publication of information, while simultaneously condemning authoritarian states for doing much the same, was both hypocritical and damaging to American standing in the world.In the context of growing concern in Australia about the terms of the AUKUS submarine deal and the Australian government’s willingness to go “all-in” with the US militarily, the continued pursuit of Assange gave the impression that Australia’s most important security ally did not take its concerns seriously. Australia appeared simply to be snapping at America’s heels.It also added to the sense that the “capital-A Alliance” between the two countries was increasingly dominated by security concerns, often at the expense of democratic accountability.Because of the international campaign to free Assange and the support it received in both Australian and American democratic institutions, there appears to be have been a reconsideration of this focus on security interests over democratic values.It should be noted, though, that the US didn’t drop its prosecution in the end; Assange has agreed to plead guilty to a felony charge of violating the Espionage Act, which in itself may set a concerning precedent for press freedom.And the fact this saga happened at all—and that it has taken more than a decade to get close to resolution—should prompt deep reflection on the values that underpin both Australia’s relationship with its most important security ally and the United States’ role in the world.-The Conversation  ","summary":"After years of legal battles and diplomatic negotiations, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange left the UK following a plea deal with the US on espionage charges, ending a decade-long saga that raised concerns about press freedom and international relations."},{"hash":"d9a6663ac3767f0cf7db6acede74f5cfecafaa8184031264c175f3398397f84b","title":"sea-change-needed-in-see","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/06/28/sea-change-needed-in-see","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/thumb6-1719462319.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1719532800000,"source":"kp","category":"editorial","content":"The famed “iron gate” called the Secondary Education Examinations has closed for 242,313 students, as 52.14 percent of the examinees failed to secure any grades, being categorised as non-graded.

And it’s nice for us to now have that opportunity ...” ","summary":"India will be out to end their global title drought while South Africa are seeking to bury their ‘chokers’ tag at Kensington Oval on Saturday when the tournament’s two unbeaten sides clash in the Twenty20 World Cup final.Their blemish-free campaigns and comprehensive victories in the semi-finals leave no doubt that the 20-team tournament’s best two sides have made the final in Bridgetown.A day after South Africa stopped Afghanistan’s fairytale run in the first semi in Trinidad, India ended England’s title defence in Guyana to make the third consecutive final of a global event across all formats.Skipper Rohit Sharma will hope India, who lost in the finals of the World Test Championship and the 50-overs home World Cup last year, will make it third time lucky.Both Rohit, 37, and stalwart Virat Kohli, 35, are playing what could be their last T20 World Cup, and winning the trophy would be a perfect farewell for them.They appear to have both the game plan and personnel to do just that.At the top of the order, Rohit personifies India’s batting philosophy, which values a string of attacking cameos more than one match-winning knock from any one batter.Their three-pronged spin attack has served them well in the second half of the tournament, while pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah has been almost unplayable so far.Rohit believes a calm dressing room has been key to India’s strong run.“We do understand the occasion but for us it’s important to keep calm and composed,” he said.“That helps us make good decisions. We need to make good decisions through the 40 overs.”Kohli’s struggles for runs appear to be India’s only worry heading into the final but Rohit has no concerns about the form of his opening partner.“We understand his class.

A kind of instability has been created in Nepali diplomacy as those appointed in political quotas are recalled after every government change. As per the recent practice, half the envoys are political appointees while the rest are recommended from among career diplomats.The June 6 decision of the government to recall envoys from 11 countries and Friday’s selection of new faces has yet again raised the question of how long governments will follow the practice that dents the country’s image and makes the conduct of its foreign policy inconsistent.Former foreign minister Narayan Khadka, who is a leader of the opposition Nepali Congress, argues that if an ambassador does not cooperate and support the government and if someone’s performance is poor, the government can recall them, but they should not be recalled en masse.The Cabinet meeting on Friday recommended ambassadors for eight countries while it has yet to pick envoys for three other countries. According to sources in the Prime Minister’s Office, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Narayan Kaji Shrestha was under pressure from Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and KP Sharma Oli, the chair of the major coalition partner CPN-UML, to recall the ambassadors and make new recommendations. An official at the PMO said that Shrestha wanted to recall those who have poor performance and to send ambassadors with good profiles and strong careers. “But that wasn’t meant to be and he eventually had to compromise with the prime minister and the UML chair,” the official said.The recommendation of Bijan Pant as ambassador to the United Kingdom was a major bone of contention between Dahal and Shrestha, said the official. Shrestha did not want to send ambassadors who didn’t have prior experience in diplomacy and international relations. The minister also wanted to avoid sending individuals with controversial backgrounds and those who have gotten repeated opportunities in state affairs, according to sources.The low point of Nepali diplomacy was when the government recalled Ambassador Shankar Sharma from India two days before Prime Minister Dahal’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, said Khadka. “Such decisions are made only by people with zero sense of diplomacy,” he added.Khadka believes that the decision was taken under Oli’s pressure and that the prime minister should at least have avoided recalling the ambassador from India for a few days. The prime minister could have recalled Sharma after he returned from India, he said.“Some ambassadors we picked in 2021 were really good. They deserved continuity but the prime minister, whose own term is uncertain, has decided to recall them,” said Khadka. “This shows the level of our diplomacy, a lack of common sense of our leaders as well as the ugly side of our politics and politicians.”The government on Friday recommended Lokdarshan Regmi, the former chief secretary and Nepal’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, as Nepal’s new envoy to India in place of incumbent ambassador, Sharma. Sharma was appointed under the Nepali Congress quota in 2021 by the Sher Bahadur Deuba government. Similarly, the government has named former commerce and industry secretary Chandra Ghimire Nepal’s new ambassador to the United States. The incumbent, Sridhar Khatri, appointed in the Congress quota in March 2022, has been recalled. Bijan Pant has been named ambassador to the United Kingdom. Pant previously served as a social development adviser to the erstwhile Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, the late Congress leader, and until recently worked as an adviser to the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI). However, this time, he was chosen as an envoy by the CPN (Maoist Centre) in the party’s quota. According to a senior Maoist Centre leader, the sudden entry of Pant has sparked discontent in the prime minister’s party.Former member of the National Human Rights Commission, Sushil Pyakurel, has been recommended for South Korea, according to the Cabinet decision. Pyakurel, who also served as an adviser to the second President of the country, Bidya Devi Bhandari, will replace Jyoti Pyakurel Bhandari. Sumnima Tuladhar, a noted child rights activist and Executive Director of Child Workers in Nepal Concerned Centre (CWIN), has been recommended as Nepal's envoy to Denmark.Similarly, Pushpa Raj Rajkarnikar will replace Sharmila Parajuli Dhakal as envoy to Spain. Rajkarnikar is a former member of the National Planning Commission and an expert in trade and financial management.He was picked by the newly formed Ashok Rai-led Janata Samajbadi Party. The new party also got to pick an envoy for Saudi Arabia, whereby it chose to send Abu Sufayan Khan of Kapilbastu district.In Malaysia, Netra Prasad Timilsina, a long-time NGO activist, has been nominated under the UML quota. He replaces Dilli Raj Poudel, who was appointed under the CPN (Unified Socialist) quota.Among others, Pyakurel, Tuladhar and Timilsina have the background of working in the NGO sector. Of the 11 vacant posts, the government on Friday made recommendations for eight countries. Recommendations for Qatar, Israel, and Portugal are pending. Those recommended get appointed only after parliamentary hearing.Ruling partner Rastriya Swatantra Party will have its say in the appointment of two envoys. But party leaders said they are still unclear which country they will get to recommend the envoys for. “We are still clueless about the countries, but we are nonetheless preparing to find envoys for our quotas,” said an RSP leader.A joint-secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs argued how the latest episode has again underscored the need for the appointment of more career diplomats. “Political parties may still appoint ambassadors to countries like India, China, and the US, but we must send career diplomats to destinations other than the three countries,” he said. At present, out of 30 Nepali embassies and three permanent missions, 16 are headed by career diplomats. The career diplomats are leading the Nepali missions in Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Egypt, France, Germany, Kuwait, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. All three Nepali permanent missions in New York, Geneva, and Vienna are also led by career diplomats.The joint-secretary said the career diplomat pie should increase from the current 50 percent to 80 or 90 percent, or the instability Nepal currently sees would continue. “The appointment of those with controversial backgrounds and despite their conflict of interest have further eroded Nepal’s image abroad. Unfortunately, this couldn’t be avoided in the appointments this time around as well,” rued the foreign ministry official.After 1990, there was the practice of recalling ambassadors after government change but the frequency of such changes greatly increased after 2006, said Yuba Nath Lamsal, former ambassador to Denmark. “If we properly screen ambassadorial candidates before their nomination and send them only after parliamentary hearing, there is no need to recall them so frequently. After all, they have been vetted in the country and have also gotten the required approval, known as ‘agrément’ in diplomatic terms, from the countries hosting them,” he said.Lamsal stressed the need to stop the frequent chopping and changing of the country’s envoys, in order to boost Nepal’s diplomatic credentials. The government in 2019 also came up with the criteria for ambassadorial appointment, but that was not followed by successive governments. Point 5 of the criteria, a copy of which was obtained by the Post, states: In view of the principle of inclusiveness, national welfare and the state’s representation, an experienced candidate with an excellent academic record and diplomatic capability will be appointed the ambassador.Point 6 further states: ambassadors must be capable and have the experience of Nepal’s foreign policy and international relations, and be informed on the dynamics of bilateral and multilateral diplomacy.Both of these criteria were ignored this time, just like they were in the past. Very few nominees have any kind of diplomatic experience or credentials. They meet only a few criteria such as being above 35 years of age, holding a bachelor’s degree, not having criminal records and not having been convicted of corruption. However, little attention is paid to avoid the conflict of interest and to meet the criteria of experience in international relations and expertise in the field of diplomacy. The criteria also states that ambassadorial appointees should hold “country-specific knowledge”. But hardly any of the nominees have relevant experience—professional or academic—on issues related to their host countries.Lamsal called for making the selection process transparent so that the host country takes Nepal’s ambassador seriously. “No doubt, envoys should be appointed on merit and they should be allowed to work for some time. Changing them frequently only tarnishes the country’s image,” he said. “This corrosive practice must stop.” ","summary":"Ambassadorial appointments, mostly after the restoration of democracy in 1990, have not been free from controversy.

As soon as the borders—land and air—opened, and the China-funded international airport in Pokhara was inaugurated, optimism was high. Before the pandemic, market insiders predicted a dramatic surge in Chinese tourists, who were Nepal’s second-largest source market after India before the Covid-19 pandemic. It didn’t happen. Nepal received 60,878 Chinese tourists in 2023, a recovery by a third from the pre-pandemic level when Chinese tourists boomed in Nepal.In the first five months (January–May) of this year, Nepal received 46,671 Chinese, with the highest arrival of 12,093 recorded in March. While Chinese arrivals slowed, Indian tourists boomed in Nepal, reaching an all-time high of 319,936 individuals, according to the Department of Immigration. Among Indians, only those who come by air are counted as tourists in Nepal. In the first five months, Nepal has received 148,861 Indian tourists, the highest number of 38,288 recorded in May. Before the pandemic, India and China were competing neck-to-neck. Now, there is a huge imbalance between the south and north.Will it change? On Monday, during the 16th round of the Nepal-China diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting held in Kathmandu, Beijing made a surprise announcement.It announced plans to promote Nepali tourism in China as part of celebrating 2025 as ‘Visit Nepal Year in China’, which Nepal’s top travel trade entrepreneurs say is a “big statement.” They say they had never before heard China favour any country with such soft power diplomacy.Will 2025 be the year for the potential great return of Chinese tourists then? “So far, I haven’t heard or seen Beijing promote any country’s tourism inside China. This is, in fact, a good gesture of neighbourliness,” said Kishore Raj Pandey, chairman of Saathi Nepal Travel and Tours, who was the first person to bring Chinese tourists to Nepal in 2001.“If it has been announced, Beijing indeed has some policy to encourage Chinese citizens to travel to Nepal.”Tourism is vital for Nepal’s economy. According to the recently released annual World Travel and Tourism Council research report, Nepal’s tourism sector generated Rs327.9 billion ($2.5 billion) in revenue and supported 1.19 million jobs directly and indirectly last year. The report forecasts that Nepal will generate 1.22 million jobs in 2024. Last year, the country received 1 million tourists.Some critics say it’s a lofty promise. Before Monday’s meeting, during the third Nepal Investment Summit held in Kathmandu on April 28, Luo Zhaohui, chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, announced the waiver of visa fees for Nepalis.It was implemented on May 1. There was another announcement, too.“The Chinese government is making arrangements to start new flights from China to Nepal’s two new international airports—Pokhara and Lumbini,” Luo said while addressing the summit.Nepal’s $216 million international airport in Pokhara, the country’s tourism capital, opened in January last year. Beijing financed it.Similarly, Nepal’s second international airport in Bhairahawa, built by Chinese contractors, started operating in May 2022 after four years of construction delays. The objectives of both projects are to decentralise economic activities in the new federal setup, attract more tourists, and prevent Nepalis from going abroad.But only some international flights are operating in the two new shiny airports.“Under Beijing's renewed diplomacy, there is a possibility of the operation of these two new international airports,” said Basant Raj Mishra, a senior tourism entrepreneur. “Once flights from China come, it will create competition.”He said Beijing’s announcement represents a great opportunity for Nepal. “We should be prepared for joint marketing and promotional activities. With a proper policy, we can attract 1 million tourists from China alone in 2025. And for this, we need enhanced flight connectivity.”China is facing many economic obstacles, but Beijing remains optimistic about growth.Reports show that Chinese tourists hit the road in significant numbers during the recent five-day Labor holidays in May but kept a tight grip on their wallets, reflecting still-weak sentiment in the world’s second-largest economy.According to a statement from China’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism, travellers made 28.2 percent more trips, but spending only rose 13.5 percent from the 2019 break. “Of all the countries, China has the largest number of airlines connecting Nepal but brings the lowest number of tourists,” said Vijay Shrestha, vice president (Administration) at Himalaya Airlines, the Nepal-Tibet joint venture. There are five airlines currently connecting China. “The traffic is low,” said Shrestha. “It may be due to low consumer confidence.”Himalaya Airlines has suspended Kathmandu-Beijing flights, and Kathmandu-Shanghai flights are also irregular due to low passenger traffic. Besides, in the other three sectors, the average occupancy is 40 percent,” said Shrestha. “The announcement from Beijing to promote Nepal in China could change that.”Nepal and China established formal diplomatic relations in 1955, and Nepal-Tibet trade goes a long way back. In 1956, four cities of Tibet, namely Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyantse, and Yatung, were designated as major trading cities for Nepali traders.Between the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 and 1982, few residents of China travelled to foreign destinations other than government officials, students, and a few businessmen. In 1983, China allowed citizens from Guangdong Province to travel to the British colony of Hong Kong on organised tours to visit family.Beginning in 1995, the Chinese National Tourism Administration formalised China’s Approved Destination Status (ADS) policy.The history of Chinese tourism in Nepal is not long either. Nepal first participated in the China International Travel Fair in 2000 to promote its tourism sector. Before 2000, the Chinese could only travel to Nepal on official visits.The Chinese government had permitted ADS for Chinese outbound travellers in November 2001. The two countries signed an initial memorandum of understanding on an implementation plan for outbound travel by Chinese people to Nepal on April 16, 2001, laying the groundwork for the ADS.Nepal was given the Approved Destination Status (ADS) by its northern neighbour in 2002, and in June of the same year, Chinese citizens began visiting Nepal officially for the first time as tourists. Nepal was the 18th nation to receive the status and first in South Asia. In 2002, Nepal got 8,715 Chinese tourists.Subsequently, the central banks of the two countries signed an agreement on bilateral cooperation that allowed the Chinese currency to be converted into Nepali rupees in a bid to boost bilateral trade, tourism, and economic cooperation.However, immediately after Nepal received the ADS, arrivals from China fell due to a violent conflict that intensified over 2002-2004, reaching Nepal’s main cities and tourist destinations. Nepal eventually started witnessing a constant growth in Chinese arrivals after June 2009.Chinese arrivals to Nepal crossed the 100,000 mark for the first time in 2013, mainly due to the improved air links between the two countries. According to the tourism ministry’s statistics, around 93 percent of Chinese tourists were first-time visitors to Nepal.In 2014, Nepal received 123,805 Chinese visitors.The 2015 earthquake and India's blockade led to arrivals from China dropping to a four-year low of 64,675 individuals in 2015, down 47.76 percent from 2014.The surface road at the Tatopani border point, where Nepal used to receive many Chinese tourists, was also blocked.On December 25, 2015, Nepal announced ‘free visa’ for Chinese tourists, giving them the same treatment accorded to South Asian visitors. In a bid to revive flagging arrivals, the scheme was implemented in January 2016.Thereon, tourist arrivals from China started rising steadily, and Nepal saw the strongest growth, 46.8 percent, in tourist arrivals from China, with the overall number reaching 153,633 visitors in 2018.In 2019, Nepal received a record 169,543 Chinese tourists.The number fell to 19,257 in 2020. In 2021 and 2022, there were 6,198 and 9,599 Chinese tourists in Nepal—mainly diplomats and those stranded in third countries—who came to Nepal when Beijing enforced never-ending lockdowns.When the Chinese economy started to boom again, Nepali investors pumped money into luxury hotels, which too have multiplied.

While Chinese arrivals slowed, Indian tourists boomed in Nepal, reaching an all-time high of 319,936 individuals, according to the Department of Immigration. Among Indians, only those who come by air are counted as tourists in Nepal. In the first five months, Nepal has received 148,861 Indian tourists, the highest number of 38,288 recorded in May. Before the pandemic, India and China were competing neck-to-neck. Now, there is a huge imbalance between the south and north.Will it change? On Monday, during the 16th round of the Nepal-China diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting held in Kathmandu, Beijing made a surprise announcement.It announced plans to promote Nepali tourism in China as part of celebrating 2025 as ‘Visit Nepal Year in China’, which Nepal’s top travel trade entrepreneurs say is a “big statement.” They say they had never before heard China favour any country with such soft power diplomacy.Will 2025 be the year for the potential great return of Chinese tourists then? “So far, I haven’t heard or seen Beijing promote any country’s tourism inside China. This is, in fact, a good gesture of neighbourliness,” said Kishore Raj Pandey, chairman of Saathi Nepal Travel and Tours, who was the first person to bring Chinese tourists to Nepal in 2001.“If it has been announced, Beijing indeed has some policy to encourage Chinese citizens to travel to Nepal.”Tourism is vital for Nepal’s economy. According to the recently released annual World Travel and Tourism Council research report, Nepal’s tourism sector generated Rs327.9 billion ($2.5 billion) in revenue and supported 1.19 million jobs directly and indirectly last year. The report forecasts that Nepal will generate 1.22 million jobs in 2024. Last year, the country received 1 million tourists.Some critics say it’s a lofty promise. Before Monday’s meeting, during the third Nepal Investment Summit held in Kathmandu on April 28, Luo Zhaohui, chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, announced the waiver of visa fees for Nepalis.It was implemented on May 1. There was another announcement, too.“The Chinese government is making arrangements to start new flights from China to Nepal’s two new international airports—Pokhara and Lumbini,” Luo said while addressing the summit.Nepal’s $216 million international airport in Pokhara, the country’s tourism capital, opened in January last year. Beijing financed it.Similarly, Nepal’s second international airport in Bhairahawa, built by Chinese contractors, started operating in May 2022 after four years of construction delays. The objectives of both projects are to decentralise economic activities in the new federal setup, attract more tourists, and prevent Nepalis from going abroad.But only some international flights are operating in the two new shiny airports.“Under Beijing's renewed diplomacy, there is a possibility of the operation of these two new international airports,” said Basant Raj Mishra, a senior tourism entrepreneur. “Once flights from China come, it will create competition.”He said Beijing’s announcement represents a great opportunity for Nepal. “We should be prepared for joint marketing and promotional activities. With a proper policy, we can attract 1 million tourists from China alone in 2025. And for this, we need enhanced flight connectivity.”China is facing many economic obstacles, but Beijing remains optimistic about growth.Reports show that Chinese tourists hit the road in significant numbers during the recent five-day Labor holidays in May but kept a tight grip on their wallets, reflecting still-weak sentiment in the world’s second-largest economy.According to a statement from China’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism, travellers made 28.2 percent more trips, but spending only rose 13.5 percent from the 2019 break. “Of all the countries, China has the largest number of airlines connecting Nepal but brings the lowest number of tourists,” said Vijay Shrestha, vice president (Administration) at Himalaya Airlines, the Nepal-Tibet joint venture. There are five airlines currently connecting China. “The traffic is low,” said Shrestha. “It may be due to low consumer confidence.”Himalaya Airlines has suspended Kathmandu-Beijing flights, and Kathmandu-Shanghai flights are also irregular due to low passenger traffic. Besides, in the other three sectors, the average occupancy is 40 percent,” said Shrestha. “The announcement from Beijing to promote Nepal in China could change that.”Nepal and China established formal diplomatic relations in 1955, and Nepal-Tibet trade goes a long way back. In 1956, four cities of Tibet, namely Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyantse, and Yatung, were designated as major trading cities for Nepali traders.Between the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 and 1982, few residents of China travelled to foreign destinations other than government officials, students, and a few businessmen. In 1983, China allowed citizens from Guangdong Province to travel to the British colony of Hong Kong on organised tours to visit family.Beginning in 1995, the Chinese National Tourism Administration formalised China’s Approved Destination Status (ADS) policy.The history of Chinese tourism in Nepal is not long either. Nepal first participated in the China International Travel Fair in 2000 to promote its tourism sector. Before 2000, the Chinese could only travel to Nepal on official visits.The Chinese government had permitted ADS for Chinese outbound travellers in November 2001. The two countries signed an initial memorandum of understanding on an implementation plan for outbound travel by Chinese people to Nepal on April 16, 2001, laying the groundwork for the ADS.Nepal was given the Approved Destination Status (ADS) by its northern neighbour in 2002, and in June of the same year, Chinese citizens began visiting Nepal officially for the first time as tourists. Nepal was the 18th nation to receive the status and first in South Asia. In 2002, Nepal got 8,715 Chinese tourists.Subsequently, the central banks of the two countries signed an agreement on bilateral cooperation that allowed the Chinese currency to be converted into Nepali rupees in a bid to boost bilateral trade, tourism, and economic cooperation.However, immediately after Nepal received the ADS, arrivals from China fell due to a violent conflict that intensified over 2002-2004, reaching Nepal’s main cities and tourist destinations. Nepal eventually started witnessing a constant growth in Chinese arrivals after June 2009.Chinese arrivals to Nepal crossed the 100,000 mark for the first time in 2013, mainly due to the improved air links between the two countries. According to the tourism ministry’s statistics, around 93 percent of Chinese tourists were first-time visitors to Nepal.In 2014, Nepal received 123,805 Chinese visitors.The 2015 earthquake and India's blockade led to arrivals from China dropping to a four-year low of 64,675 individuals in 2015, down 47.76 percent from 2014.The surface road at the Tatopani border point, where Nepal used to receive many Chinese tourists, was also blocked.On December 25, 2015, Nepal announced ‘free visa’ for Chinese tourists, giving them the same treatment accorded to South Asian visitors. In a bid to revive flagging arrivals, the scheme was implemented in January 2016.Thereon, tourist arrivals from China started rising steadily, and Nepal saw the strongest growth, 46.8 percent, in tourist arrivals from China, with the overall number reaching 153,633 visitors in 2018.In 2019, Nepal received a record 169,543 Chinese tourists.The number fell to 19,257 in 2020. In 2021 and 2022, there were 6,198 and 9,599 Chinese tourists in Nepal—mainly diplomats and those stranded in third countries—who came to Nepal when Beijing enforced never-ending lockdowns.When the Chinese economy started to boom again, Nepali investors pumped money into luxury hotels, which too have multiplied.

We called a snake handler and handed over the king cobra.”Sindhupalchowk is a mountain district where venomous snakes were thought of as non-existent. However, incidents of king cobra bites in mountain districts like Sindhupalchowk suggest that venomous snakes have started migrating towards hill and mountain districts, and rising temperatures caused by climate change are the main culprit, experts say.Nepal is among the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising at a faster rate of 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year. Compared to districts of the Tarai region, those in hills and mountains have been witnessing a more rapid increase in daytime maximum temperatures, which could have helped venomous snakes survive there, experts say.“Not only in Sindhupalchowk, but a king cobra bite was also spotted in Godawari of Lalitpur district last year,” said Basaula. “Snakebite cases have started rising alarmingly of late.”Of the 31 patients admitted to the hospital on Sunday, 16—more than 50 percent—were snakebite cases. Doctors at the hospital say eight to ten snakebite victims seek treatment there every day, and most victims seeking care at the hospital are from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from those adjoining the Valley.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.However, snakebite cases are vastly underreported in the country. The Ministry of Health and Population said that only 14 deaths and 1,220 cases of snakebites had been reported in 11 months of the current fiscal year. Officials admit that venomous snakebite incidents are being reported from hill and mountain districts, and the demand for anti-snake venom is on the rise. They attribute this rise in snakebite incidents to rising temperatures. “Health facilities in some mountainous and hilly districts—like Darchula and Bajura—have asked for anti-snake venom,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Snakebite incidents have been on the rise,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the division. “With the onset of the monsoon, people living in the risk areas should remain vigilant.”Every year, the Health Ministry purchases around 25,000 vials of anti-snake venom and distributes them to around 100 snakebite treatment centres in the country.Officials say as snakebite cases surge, so will the demand for additional treatment centres. “This year, we are planning to set up an additional 15 snakebite treatment centres,” said Ojha. Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive about the risks. They say people living in thatched-roof houses are particularly vulnerable to snakebites, as snakes often enter such homes in search of rats. They say people should be asked to keep their homes and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in bushy areas, avoid venturing out at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.Likewise, women and children who have to work in fields and go to the jungle are at the highest risk of snakebites. Small children are at risk of dying from snakebites, as they do not tell their parents about the bites on time due to fear of getting scolded for playing in the bushes, according to doctors.“We should make people aware so that they seek medical attention immediately after a snakebite, using whatever means of transport they get,” said Ojha. “The faster you reach the hospital, the greater your chances of survival.” ","summary":"Last month, a local from Sindhupalchowk district was brought to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital to treat a snakebite.

The duel has attracted numerous newspaper articles, set social media on fire and provided YouTubers a field day. What is Oli’s motive in mobilising his whole party to attack Balen, and what is Balen—a lone man with no political experience and political following—doing picking a fight with Oli? How will the duel impact Oli’s party and Balen’s aspirations going forward? The fightThe Balen-Oli fight began when the metropolitan city started to clear buildings built illegally on municipal land or business advertisements that did not comply with municipal regulations. The city would order the current occupants of the offending buildings or business owners to comply with the law and vacate the premises. In most cases, the occupants would ignore the order. Like in old times, they relied on their political connections to continue to subvert the law. However, that did not work with Balen. He sent municipal forces to demolish the encroachment and non-compliant adverts. The first property subjected to the mayor's action belonged to someone connected to the UML. Soon after the clearance, a Central Committee member of the UML, Mahesh Basnet, called upon his minions to physically harm Balen if he did not “mend his ways”.Balen’s attempt to clean up Kathmandu from squatters occupying public land, particularly river banks, intensified the conflict. Oli publicly mocked Balen for using bulldozers to demolish plastic shades built by “poor squatters.” Some “squatters” are believed to occupy multistory buildings constructed on public land and own businesses worth millions of rupees. The majority of them are UML voters, “UMLs’ vote bank”, observed a Balen supporter. The squatter problem is not new. All previous governments, including the one led by Oli, recognised it. The conflict became increasingly acrimonious when Balen opened the basement of Dharahara for car parking. The government objected, arguing that the reconstruction of Dharahara is still incomplete and the car park is unsafe to use. Balen retorted, “Dharahara was inaugurated as a completed project by Prime Minister Oli before the last election. How can it be incomplete?” The inauguration of the work-in-progress was one of Prime Minister Oli’s pre-election charades. The car park is safe and currently in use; the reconstruction continues. The recent New Road imbroglio added fuel to the fire. Balen started widening the footpath on New Road to comply with the standards set by the Nepal Department of Roads (NDR). A local ward chair, a UML member, objected and complained to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ragubhir Mahaseth, an Oli acolyte. The NDR, which reports to Mahaseth, issued a “stop work” order. Incensed, Balen asked Oli to expeditiously arrange repayment for those who cheated the so-called Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land plotting scandal. Oli’s apparatchiks compared Balen to “a puppy” (a good-for-nothing weakling) and chastised him for maligning “our respected Chairman”. Oli himself has described Balen as a “bubble” which will fizzle out in no time. The fightersOli is old, witty, foxy, prickly, intolerant of criticism and, like all other politicians, corrupt in the public eye. As enunciated during his premiership, his vision of economic development includes building view towers, providing Kathmandu households with piped gas within six months, and building facilities for maritime trade—the latter two unachievable pipe dreams or political ploys. Balen is young, angry, ambitious, audacious, brash, bold, impulsive, focussed and untainted by corruption. His vision for Kathmandu is to make it a clean, functioning, beautiful heritage city. In about two years since he became mayor, Kathmandu has become relatively cleaner and greener. Its roads are rid of perpetual potholes; its sidewalks are walkable; teaching standards in public schools have improved; private schools who were short-changing on paying taxes have been forced to pay their share; emergency ambulance service has become more dependable, and so on. All of the above, despite a lack of support from political parties and the government. Parties do not support him because his success will spotlight their past failures. Despite the odds, his accomplishments have made him hugely popular throughout the country. “If we have ten leaders like Balen, we can change the country,” an exuberant Kathmandu taxi driver told me. Even the international press has taken note of Balen’s leadership. The New York Times published a story on Balen last year. He was named one of the 100 upcoming leaders in 2023 by the internationally known Time Magazine, published in the US. Balen’s public support is so visceral that he gets away even with outrageous comments like “burning Singha Durbar’, Nepal’s central secretariat, the office of Nepal’s Ministries, and irrelevant dragging of Oli into the “Giri Bandhu Tea Estate” scandal, and other similar outbursts. Although the overwhelming support for such comments on social media is surprising, it is indicative of the intensity of public dislike of established politicians.The future Balen knows that he owes his popularity as much to his performance as his refusal to bow down to political pressure and to stay clean from corruption scandals. In the two years since he assumed office, he has given confidence to the city dwellers that with exemplary leadership, the city and the country can be changed. His future depends on whether he can continue to ignore political pressure and demonstrate his perseverance, will, guts and vision to turn chaotic Kathmandu into a livable metropolis. As for Oli, UML lost the last election in Kathmandu because its mayor, a UML member, was a dismal failure. The confrontation with Balen for political upmanship and ego inflation will unlikely win Kathmandu for him. Cooperation may work better than confrontation.    ","summary":"The duel between Kathmandu’s 34-year-old mayor Balendra Shaha (popularly called Balen), a structural engineer, reputed rapper and political novice, and 72-year-old Khagda Prasad Sharma Oli, a high school dropout, two-time prime minister, political veteran and chairperson of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) is a caricature of contemporary Nepali politics marred by the conflict between the old and the young.

After the electoral setback in Ilam-2, where the party’s candidate could not even retain the security deposit, an RSP secretariat meeting on May 3 had tasked General Secretary Dhakal with the responsibility of conducting a nationwide tour to assess public sentiment towards the party.Political observers see Dhakal’s call as obvious. As new political outfits get less space to manoeuvre while working with traditional parties, not only the RSP but other newer political forces also find it challenging to assert their relevance.“As the new party that emerged as a political force by capitalising on public discontent with traditional parties failed to outperform them, a negative narrative is taking shape,” Chandra Dev Bhatta, a political scientist, told the Post. Any political party needs a political plank to survive for any length of time. However, new outfits lack this, making it difficult for them to work with other political parties, especially the traditional ones, says Bhatta. “When new political parties lack clear agenda and principles, on what basis will they have smooth cooperation with the traditional guards?” Bhatta added. “This is why new political forces will face difficulties while working with the old parties.”But the RSP had a political plank. During the 2022 general elections, the party capitalised on the public disillusionment with the old political parties by promising good governance, and a crackdown on corruption. The anti-corruption campaign quickly propelled the party into national politics within a short time after its establishment. However, the party failed to live up to the political agenda it championed during the election campaign when it joined the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government on December 25, 2022, for the first time. The party quit the government within months after Lamichhane was stripped of his parliamentary position following controversy over his citizenship certificate. The party rejoined the Dahal-led government on March 4 after the changes in the coalition.The RSP leaders have been criticised for failing to live up to their promises and colluding with traditional parties. Dhakal, after submitting his assessment report to party chief Lamichhane, acknowledged that the party failed to fulfil the promises made to voters on the campaign trail. “It was a mistake of the party to ally with the old guards of politics which the RSP heavily criticised in the past,” Dhakal told the Post.Leaders from other new outfits think that it is a compulsion to work with the old forces despite differences in working styles. Chandan Jha, general secretary of the Janamat Party, another new political outfit that emerged after the 2022 elections, says it is natural for new parties to feel uncomfortable while cooperating with traditional ones.“One reason why new parties face problems while allying with old ones is differences in operational approaches between them,” Jha told the Post. “The working styles of new and old ones are different, which makes it difficult to collaborate.”However, given our electoral system that has made it difficult for a political party to secure a majority in parliament, cooperation with other parties is the only way to form a government and survive, Jha adds. The Janamat Party has succeeded in taking the leadership of the Madhesh provincial government by unseating the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal of veteran Madhesh leader Upendra Yadav. Various parties that Yadav led had continuously led the provincial government for over seven years. The CK Raut-led Janamat Party succeeded in displacing Yadav’s party only with the support of traditional parties like the UML and the Maoist Centre. The Janamat Party supported the Dahal-led coalition at the centre and the UML-Maoist coalition backed the party’s leadership in the province. A leader of the Maoist Centre describes the statement of RSP General Secretary Dhakal as a reflection of growing public frustration with the party. The new party that had enjoyed overwhelming public support during the 2022 election is now facing a reality check, says the Maoist leader.“It is true that people disillusioned with traditional political parties supported the RSP and other new outfits during the 2022 elections,” Lekh Nath Dahal, Maoist Centre lawmaker told the Post. “But the level of public frustration is not always the same, and not always against the same parties.”The RSP, which has failed to perform while in government, however, is blaming the old parties for its failure, Dahal said.“What has the RSP done while leading the home ministry?” Dahal questioned. “Like the old parties, the president of a new political party is promoting and transferring police personnel at his whim.” The Post briefly talked to the RSP’s Dhakal on Wednesday, immediately after he submitted the report to party president Lamichhane. He said that the party should explore the chances of collaborating with independent figures such as mayors Shah and Hamal even though the party does not endorse all of their activities.“To start with, the RSP should cooperate with Shah on some of his plans such as clearing illegally occupied land in slum areas in Kathmandu,” Dhakal said. “By the end of 2083 BS [a year ahead of the 2027 election], the party should also consider forming alliances with Shah and Hamal.”But political analyst Bhatta doubts the chances of collaboration between RSP and independent mayors Shah and Hamal. Bhatta says the working styles and issues championed by Shah, Hamal, and RSP leadership don’t match. “However, if they somehow come together, they can possibly be a powerful political force,” Bhatta adds. ","summary":"“It would be most appropriate for us to collaborate with independent forces such as Balen and Gopi Hamal instead of Oli and Prachanda [Pushpa Kamal Dahal].”This statement by Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) General Secretary Mukul Dhakal on Wednesday has stirred a debate: are the new and traditional political forces really so incompatible that they cannot collaborate, and how likely is it for the new forces to come together?RSP General Secretary Dhakal emphasised the need for working with new forces such as Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah and Mayor of Dhangadhi Sub-metropolitan City Gopi Hamal, rather than entering into coalitions and partnerships with older crop of politicians like CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who is also chief of the CPN (Maoist Centre).Dhakal said so after submitting an assessment report on the RSP’s standing among the people to party president Rabi Lamichhane, who is deputy prime minister and home minister in the Dahal-led government.Dhakal prepared the 32-page report after touring 38 districts and interacting with nearly 3,000 people in a period of one month as tasked by the party soon after its by-election debacle in Ilam-2.After the tour, Dhakal concluded that giving continuity to the partnership with traditional political parties like the UML and the Maoist Centre could prove counterproductive for the RSP in the long run. After the electoral setback in Ilam-2, where the party’s candidate could not even retain the security deposit, an RSP secretariat meeting on May 3 had tasked General Secretary Dhakal with the responsibility of conducting a nationwide tour to assess public sentiment towards the party.Political observers see Dhakal’s call as obvious. As new political outfits get less space to manoeuvre while working with traditional parties, not only the RSP but other newer political forces also find it challenging to assert their relevance.“As the new party that emerged as a political force by capitalising on public discontent with traditional parties failed to outperform them, a negative narrative is taking shape,” Chandra Dev Bhatta, a political scientist, told the Post. Any political party needs a political plank to survive for any length of time. However, new outfits lack this, making it difficult for them to work with other political parties, especially the traditional ones, says Bhatta. “When new political parties lack clear agenda and principles, on what basis will they have smooth cooperation with the traditional guards?” Bhatta added. “This is why new political forces will face difficulties while working with the old parties.”But the RSP had a political plank. During the 2022 general elections, the party capitalised on the public disillusionment with the old political parties by promising good governance, and a crackdown on corruption. The anti-corruption campaign quickly propelled the party into national politics within a short time after its establishment. However, the party failed to live up to the political agenda it championed during the election campaign when it joined the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government on December 25, 2022, for the first time. The party quit the government within months after Lamichhane was stripped of his parliamentary position following controversy over his citizenship certificate. The party rejoined the Dahal-led government on March 4 after the changes in the coalition.The RSP leaders have been criticised for failing to live up to their promises and colluding with traditional parties. Dhakal, after submitting his assessment report to party chief Lamichhane, acknowledged that the party failed to fulfil the promises made to voters on the campaign trail. “It was a mistake of the party to ally with the old guards of politics which the RSP heavily criticised in the past,” Dhakal told the Post.Leaders from other new outfits think that it is a compulsion to work with the old forces despite differences in working styles. Chandan Jha, general secretary of the Janamat Party, another new political outfit that emerged after the 2022 elections, says it is natural for new parties to feel uncomfortable while cooperating with traditional ones.“One reason why new parties face problems while allying with old ones is differences in operational approaches between them,” Jha told the Post. “The working styles of new and old ones are different, which makes it difficult to collaborate.”However, given our electoral system that has made it difficult for a political party to secure a majority in parliament, cooperation with other parties is the only way to form a government and survive, Jha adds.

Fueled by alcohol, they spew an exorbitant amount of profanity in every sentence. “What a bitch!” they whine repeatedly (among other disgraceful rants.) As their profanity intensifies and they descend into a frenzy, the story unfolds: their female colleague had merely voiced her frustration about feeling underutilised and underestimated in the office. She communicated, though cunningly, about how she was given fewer projects than her male colleague, who contributed little. Communicating assertively about discrimination in the workforce? Indeed! What a bitchy thing to do.Sexist men in the workplace are infuriating beyond belief. This fury and exasperation is amplified in the workforce because sexist men severely underestimate women. They often refuse to collaborate with you due to their long-internalised assumption of female incompetence. ‘Play the System’ is a familiar play because it reflects the common sexism and discrimination women and girls face in the workforce. To sexist ‘corporate bros,’ women are merely decorative, and subservience is a woman’s most remarkable quality. This theatre production capitalises on stereotypes, increasing its relatability. Kausi Theatre's compactness fully envelops the audience, and the wonderful actors completely captivate from the start. You are so intensely focused that you find yourself cursing alongside the characters, feeling their frustration boiling within you, and recollecting similar experiences from your own life.Sailesh (played by Eelum Dixit) is the boss who favours his male colleague over his female counterpart and exhibits severe discrimination against women. Biswas (played by Suraj Malla) is the enabler, a bystander who occasionally voices mild dissonance about women to appease his boss but generally remains silent. Pankaj (played by Rishikesh Basyal) is a stereotypical slacker, all talk and no action, who uses philosophical jargon to mask his incompetence. Chahana (played by Roshani Syanbo) is a quintessential “pick me” character. She is eager to please the men in the office, switching her tone to please them and complying without protest. She is the embodiment of submission, which is why the men in the office tolerate her. Namita (played by Ranjana Bhattarai) is confident, smart, and exceptionally talented, but in this competitive architecture firm, she must navigate the system carefully to be taken seriously.Namita’s theme song would undoubtedly be Taylor Swift's ‘The Man’: “I'm so sick of running as fast as I can, wondering if I would get there quicker if I was a man.” In contrast to her colleague Pankaj, who garners praise for minimal effort, Namita struggles to secure meaningful assignments and faces pervasive assumptions of incompetence. Even when she delivers, her achievements are frequently overlooked and overtly scrutinised. Her story reflects the broader challenges working women endure in male-dominated fields, where despite their undeniable talent, they are often unfairly judged as sub-par or deemed incompetent.Women often have to go out of their way just to be acknowledged or appreciated. The rat race and corporate grind become even more intense for women due to the additional hurdles they face. Namita has no choice but to become the “bitch” her coworkers think she is, or she won't survive the workplace. Despite the discrimination and frustrations she faces, Namita persists. The dynamics between Namita and Chahana are deeply interesting to watch. Both women are victims of rampant sexism in their workplace, but they respond differently: Chahana bends to the discrimination, while Namita protests against it.From the audience's perspective, neither woman is wrong—they are simply doing what it takes to survive in a male-dominated, toxic environment. They clash over this difference, with Namita judging Chahana for choosing to stay ignorant, while Chahana criticises Namita for being too confrontational and not complying with the 'system' that discriminates against her.Watching these characters interact with one another is highly amusing. A recurring joke about ‘piping’ threads throughout the production, becoming funnier each time the issue is mentioned. The actors skillfully make the audience love and hate them simultaneously—all characters are grey to varying degrees.It can be enjoyable to watch a grey female character; the majority of the audience may even think ‘good for her,’ when Namita cunningly plays games to preserve herself within the system.For women, this play is catharsis. The moment when Namita breaks down, overwhelmed by the realisation that no matter how hard she tries, it is never enough, becomes a pivotal point of emotional release. Watching how Namita is treated by the audience may also help women recognise that, more often than not, they are not the problem; sexism is.This play would’ve easily been five stars if it didn’t have the ending it does. It felt as if the ending drove the play away from the message it was originally trying to convey.However, with brilliant writing, wonderful actors, beautiful set design, and an evocative storyline that represents women’s plight, this play is a must-watch. For me, it might even warrant a re-watch because it delivers an important message while being deeply engaging, funny, delightful, and wholesome at times.It accurately depicts human relationships and is a release for women who have always been suppressed or labelled as ‘bossy’ for simply being competent and confident.Despite claims that feminism is unnecessary and sexism is non-existent (by the Saileshs and Pankajs themselves), the impact this play has on women proves otherwise.With sexism, it is important to take the bull by the horns, as there is no progress in the face of denial. By acknowledging the impacts of sexism, we are actively sparing confident little girls who are unfairly labelled as 'bossy' or 'annoying' from the challenges faced by women like Namita.Play the SystemDirector: Akanchha KarkiCast: Eelum Dixit, Ranjana Bhattarai, Suraj Malla, Roshani Syangbo, Rishikesh BasyalDuration: 1 hour 30 minutesVenue: Kausi Theatre, TekuShowtimes: Every day at 5:15 pm and an extra 1:00 pm show on Saturday until July 15 ","summary":"In the highest room of the office, illuminated by lights ranging from warm yellows to cold blues, two men launch into a vile tirade about their female colleague.

After handing over the 32-page report to party president Rabi Lamichhane on Wednesday, Dhakal told the Post: “After the review tour, I have come to the conclusion that if the party continues to run as it does now, it will crash within a short period.”The report Dhakal submitted to Lamichhane, who is the deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs, claims that the popularity of the party which emerged by winning 20 seats in the 2022 election has nosedived. Additionally, the report argues that Lamichhane’s popularity has also dipped. Dhakal demanded that the party should make his report public. But an RSP leader, who is also a federal lawmaker, says as the report deals with the party’s internal matters, it should first have been discussed within the RSP secretariat.“General Secretary Dhakal made a mistake by going to the media before discussing the matter in the party,” the leader told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “Why Dhakal went to the media is a curious matter.”However, Dhakal responded that as the general secretary, he came to the media for the first time since the party’s establishment two years ago. “You should understand why the party is being criticised from various quarters today,” Dhakal told the Post. “The party has faced ruin due to someone’s loose talk. I haven’t done so.”Dhakal’s apparent target was party president Lamichhane, who is often criticised for making unnecessary comments and promises. Although the general secretary has submitted a report based on his observations during the review trip, the implementation of the findings will come only after the party’s secretariat meeting, said Kabindra Burlakoti, the organisational committee head and joint general secretary of the party. “The general secretary personally prepared and submitted the report. No other leaders of the party were involved in its preparation,” Burlakoti told the Post. “The report might not be implemented as it is, and the party’s secretariat might amend it.”Soon after the by-election debacle in April this year, a secretariat meeting of the party on May 3 decided to conduct a cross-country review tour under a Dhakal-led team.The RSP had won one more seat in the House of Representatives from the by-elections held a year ago. But this year, the party’s candidate in Ilam-2 did not win enough votes and even lost the security deposit. RSP candidate Milan Limbu stood fourth when independent candidate Dikendra Singh Limbu won third-highest votes in the constituency.Dhakal commenced the journey on May 19 with the objective of identifying the party’s strengths and weaknesses, in relation to its policies, decisions, and organisational structure. While seeing off Dhakal, Lamichhane expressed his belief that the suggestions and insights gathered during the tour would make the party stronger. The party, which last year secured two out of three by-election seats in Chitwan-2 and Tanahun-1, was optimistic about giving the competitors a tough fight in Ilam-2 in April. While talking to the Post, party leaders engaged in the campaign were then confident of a good performance. On the campaign trail of the 2022 election, RSP leaders, mainly its chair Lamichhane, fiercely criticised leaders of traditional parties and asked voters to remove them from power. However, the RSP leaders then stood accused of working in collusion with the same old parties and their leaders, especially the UML. Additionally, when Lamichhane was linked to various scams, most recently the routing of the cooperative’s money to Gorkha Media Network, the party lost its lustre, leading to its poor performance in Ilam-2. During the election campaign in Ilam-2, Lamichhane was also questioned over a conflict of interest, as his ministry was commanding the police force that was investigating such scams. The RSP joined the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government on March 4. RSP President Lamichhane won back the home ministry by driving a hard bargain. Some saw Lamichhane’s insistence on the home ministry as an attempt to try to influence the investigation into the cooperative scam. General Secretary Dhakal claims that the party’s popularity has taken a beating, not only due to the cooperative scam but also because of the party leaders’ unfulfilled promises to voters.Before joining the government on March 4, RSP leaders extensively discussed the ‘Mission 2084’ aimed at making the RSP the largest force in the next general elections. Observers said that the party had joined the government even when it is not in a position to honour its promises to the people.Santosh Pariyar, chief whip of the party in the federal parliament, said he is not fully informed on the report submitted by the party general secretary.“I can’t comment on the report without first going through it,” Pariyar told the Post. “We can say something concrete only after the report is formally presented at the party’s secretariat meeting.”However, party insiders claim that the report criticises the party leadership’s rush for power without much care for the RSP’s original agenda. Another party leader, who also asked not to be named, said the report suggests that the party should have allied with leaders such as Balendra Shah, the mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan City, rather than joining hands with traditional forces like the UML and the Maoist Centre.Shah is believed to be quietly laying the ground for launching his own political party, cashing in on the public anger against traditional forces.Dhakal also acknowledged that he wants the party to better communicate with Mayor Shah. The RSP should explore the chances of cooperating with him even though the party does not endorse all of his recent activities, Dhakal told the Post.“To start with, the RSP should cooperate with Shah on an agenda like evacuating illegally occupied land in slum areas,” Dhakal said. “By the end of 2083 BS [a year ahead of the 2027 election], the party should also consider allying with Shah.”Despite being in the government, some RSP ministers and party leaders have voiced their dissatisfaction. Minister for Youth and Sports Biraj Bhakta Shrestha, addressing a function a few weeks ago, said that time had come to review the party’s participation in the government and its support for the coalition. Shrestha even warned the party leaders to be ready to quit the government. Claiming that they carry resignation letters all the time, Shrestha said, “As soon as we start feeling frustrated, we will put in our papers.” ","summary":"Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) General Secretary Mukul Dhakal, in his political document prepared after a review tour of 32 districts, has claimed that the party is headed for an accident.In his political report, Dhakal has pointed out things the two-year old party needs to rectify in order to avert such an accident.

Twelve aspirants—nine men and three women—filed their candidacies for the three posts of deputy general secretary.Besides, three leaders were in the fray for a treasurer position; and 34 leaders had filed their candidacies for seven positions of secretary.To the question of whether the leaders had deferred the election finding it difficult to pick individuals for available positions, party insiders gave multiple answers.A leader linked the leadership election deferral to the party split in the first week of May.A group of JSP-Nepal leaders split the party and formed the Janata Samajbadi Party under the leadership of Ashok Rai. The Election Commission registered the new outfit on May 6.The JSP-Nepal led by Yadav on May 13 moved the Supreme Court, accusing the commission of recognising its splinter group as a party without the legal basis.Yadav, in his petition, claimed that the commission had registered the party even without the required 40 percent central members on its side. The top court has ordered the relevant authorities to stall the process until the verdict and the case is still sub judice.The uncertainty prevents the newly formed Rai-led party from expediting its activities in a formal way. Seven of the 12 JSP-Nepal lawmakers in the federal parliament and 30 of the 406 party central committee members are with Rai.The new outfit’s plan to build its organisation at the provincial and local levels is in limbo due to the delayed court process. Leaders from the new party claimed that a large number of leaders and cadres are waiting to join the new organisation. Moreover, they are planning to embrace those aspirants of top positions when they are denied posts in central bodies. Observers of Madhesh politics claimed that the JSP-Nepal was unable to complete its election process with the splinter faction eying to lure its members. However, Manish Kumar Suman, one of the aspirants for general secretary in the JSP-Nepal, denied it. He claimed that the stalled general convention process, including the selection of leaders for office bearers positions, would be completed within a week.“As per the election commission deadline, we have to complete the whole general convention process within 35 days,” Suman told the Post. “We will complete the process before the timeframe.”Some political observers say the JSP-Nepal went for the general convention only out of the constitutional compulsion. If the party really wanted to follow the democratic process, it should have allowed the election process to go forward.Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates the political parties to hold the general convention at least once in five years.“Upendra Yadav has made himself the JSP-Nepal patron,” Shiva Chandra Chaudhary, a Madhesh political observer, told the Post. “He can select leaders loyal to him, having been reelected the party chairman. So he stalled the democratic process.”On the other hand, the new outfit—Janata Samajbadi Party—too has failed to give momentum to the party building process in the six weeks since its inception.The new outfit has gained prominence apparently with the support of the ruling coalition. The Election Commission swiftly registered the new party on May 6 with the name similar to the mother party despite legal ambiguities in the process. The JSP joined the ruling coalition immediately after its formation and supported the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government. The Rai-led party has been given a Cabinet minister and a state minister. On Saturday, when the Cabinet made recommendations for ambassadors to eight countries, two nominations went to the new outfit’s supporters. Ambassadors for Saudi Arabia and Spain were appointed in the JSP quotas. Days after the JSP-Nepal withdrew its support to the government, the Rai-led JSP gave its trust vote to Dahal and it supported the government in its policies and programmes.Lawmaker Sushila Shrestha of the JSP tried to downplay the difficulties saying that they were carrying out the party’s activities quietly. “We are engaged in several activities to strengthen the newly formed party, but we are not visible in the media,” Shrestha claimed. “Next Saturday and Sunday, our party’s central committee is meeting.” Shrestha claimed that her party is stronger than the JSP-Nepal in the provinces except for Madhesh. “We have been holding the meetings of provincial committees and are working to make our presence felt in Madhesh Province too.”Though Shrestha claims there are a number of activities within the party, political observers believe that its activities are stagnant due to the case sub judice in the court. “A writ petition in the Supreme Court related to the party split has stalled the new party formation,” Tula Narayan Shah, a political analyst, told the Post.Yadav has claimed the commission registered the party despite its failure to fulfil the required 40 percent support of central members for a party split. JSP-Nepal had 406 central committee members at the time of the party split, but the splinter group only had 30 central members with it.The newly formed JSP was registered amid a legal void as the Political Parties Act 2017 was replaced by an ordinance but not revived afterwards. According to the Act, a group of dissidents can split a party and form a new one if they can prove the support of at least 40 percent of the central committee members and at least 40 percent of the party’s lawmakers.However, this provision was nullified through an ordinance three years ago, leaving no legal basis for a party split. On June 9, the Supreme Court referred the dispute related to the party to the full bench.

Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.“Every Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,” said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. “Decisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.

The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Due to the lack of doctors at our urban health promotion centres, patients suffering from mental health problems have been deprived of timely treatment,” said Nali Bajracharya, a senior public health officer at the department. “Now patients having mental health issues and seeking care at our health centres will also get mental health treatment.”Though neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that a lot of people could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems—anxiety, depression and others.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Health workers say that many city dwellers, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results. For that, early diagnosis is crucial,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Other local units should also follow the initiative to provide mental health screening training to health workers, including doctors.”Nepal is among the countries with highest rates of suicide, which is an extreme manifestation of a mental health problem.According to Nepal Police data, 6,993 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2022-2023. This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide.

Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu.

One crashed in Nepalgunj.The five planes have been grounded at the remote parking bay on the eastern side of Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu since 2020 and are gathering rust.In July 2020, the board of directors of Nepal Airlines unanimously decided to stop flying the Chinese planes as they cost more money to operate than they brought in.Nepal Airlines twice issued notices to lease them out on September 14, 2022, but no one was interested.Then, Nepal Airlines decided to get rid of them permanently.On January 19, the airline requested proposals for a full appraisal of the two MA60 and three Y12e aircraft. An American company that did the appraisal valued the aircraft at Rs220 million.But fearing selling the aircraft at junkyard price may attract the anti-graft body’s interest, Nepal Airlines management decided to do a separate internal assessment.As per the Nepal Airlines value, the asking price of the MA60s, with registration mark 9N-AKR, was $8,225,501; for 9N-AKQ, it was $4,922,235.Similarly, the asking price for Y12e, with registration mark 9N-AKV, was $2,412,671, 9N-AKT was valued at $2,358,860 and 9N-AKS at $1,658,517.In contrast to the valuation made by the American company, Nepal Airlines set the asking price of five Chinese planes at $19,577,784 (Rs2.60 billion).Now, Nepal Airlines is determined to give one last try to auction the Chinese planes. Officials are working tirelessly, and they believe a successful third attempt is possible, despite the challenges. Failing to get the bidders on the third attempt would put the national carrier under pressure to sell them at scrap value, but the team is not giving up.“We are in the process of starting a fresh auction. This will be the third attempt,” said Devendra Pun, spokesperson (technical) for Nepal Airlines.“There will be a new evaluation of the aircraft rates, and we are hopeful of a positive outcome,” said Pun. The sale of these planes could mark a new beginning for the airline, reducing some financial burden they are responsible for.After spending $20,000 on the international appraisal report, there will be little appetite for another appraisal. Pun said he is unsure whether Nepal Airlines would hire another international appraiser or do it internally.The management had tabled the proposal to auction the planes for the third time at the board on April 2. The board, however, is yet to decide. “The management is carefully considering all options and is committed to making the best decision for the future of Nepal Airlines,” said Pun.Nepal Airlines officials say the grounded planes have been more trouble than they are worth.Operating the aircraft was a massive financial strain, exacerbated by breakdowns and a lack of pilots. The company is in great distress, saddled with a debt totalling nearly Rs50 billion.Officials said the Chinese-made aircraft had turned into white elephants right after they arrived. They doubt anyone will buy them.The national flag carrier put the Chinese planes up for lease on September 14, 2022. Prospective bidders were given an October 31 deadline. As there were no bids, the deadline was extended until November 16. There were still no takers, and the management decided to sell them off.The MA60 is a turboprop-powered airliner produced by China’s Xi’an Aircraft Industrial Corporation. Both manufacturers are subsidiaries of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), a government undertaking.The Y12e is a twin-engine turboprop utility aircraft built by Harbin Aircraft Industry Group, previously Harbin Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation.Except for flying to a few airports in the Tarai, these aircraft spent more time on the ground than in the air, even during operating hours.Before the planes were grounded, the total accumulated losses of these planes came to Rs1.9 billion, nearly half of their cost.A brief report submitted to the tourism ministry shows that the airline is paying insurance, parking and regular check-up charges for the grounded planes. Nepal Airlines signed a commercial agreement with China AVIC in November 2012 to procure six aircraft—two MA60s and four Y12es.China provided grant and concessional loan worth 408 million Chinese yuan (Rs6.67 billion) to purchase the six aircraft.Of the total aid, a grant of 180 million yuan (Rs2.94 billion) went to pay for one MA60 and one Y12e aircraft, and a 228 million yuan (Rs3.72 billion) loan was used to purchase an MA60 and three Y12e aircraft.As per the agreement, the Nepal government has to pay 1.5 percent annual interest, a service charge, and management expenses amounting to 0.4 percent of the overall loan taken by the Ministry of Finance.The ministry, in turn, would charge Nepal Airlines an annual interest of 1.75 percent on the disbursed loan amount.As per the November 2012 agreement, China gave Nepal Airlines a seven-year grace period during which it would not have to pay interest or instalments. The planes have completed the seven-year grace period.The loan’s payback period is 20 years or by March 21, 2034. Nepal received the first batch of planes in 2014. However, due to issues with the first batch, the delivery of the rest was stalled for years.The second batch of MA60 and Y12e aircraft arrived in January 2017 as part of the six-aircraft deal between Nepal and China.The corporation received the final two Y12e aircraft in February 2018.

A merchant transaction refers to any payment made by a customer to a business or seller. The service has been opened only for goods and service payments in India.With Nepal’s central bank allowing cross-border payment, Nepali payment system operators say they would begin the service in India soon.In a separate circular, the central bank said that Nepali companies involved in digital cross-border payment systems should get prior approval from Nepal Rastra Bank to sign a memorandum of understanding with foreign partners. “We were allowed to receive the payment by the Indian citizens using QR codes in Nepal. Now, the new provision has allowed the banking and financial institutions associated with Fonepay to make payments using QR codes through their respective mobile banking apps in India,” said Paras Kunwar, Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Fonepay. “We will soon begin the service for Nepalis in India.”“Besides a few document works, we are technically ready,” Kunwar said.Starting March 1, Indians were allowed to make payments through their mobile phones. The development was hailed as a milestone in cross-border digital payment between Nepal and India, facilitating the students and people going to India for medical purposes.Nepal’s Fonepay Payment Service has partnered with India’s NPCI International Payments to launch the cross-border payment service using quick response (QR) codes.According to officials, Nepal’s central bank has introduced a retail payment switch to facilitate person-to-person transactions. Nepal Clearing House, a public limited company, can also transact through the retail payment switch.With the delay in implementing the National Payment Switch, the central bank has provisioned a retail switch for inter-country payment through a quick QR code system.On March 15, Nepal Rastra Bank amended the inter-country payment system through QR code guidelines and introduced a provision for Indian workers in Nepal who have accounts in Nepali banks to send money through e-banking, interbank payment, mobile banking, and QR code to Indian banks and financial institutions through the national payment switch.However, a circular published on Thursday provisioned sending money through the retail payment switch until the national payment switch comes into full operation.The central bank has set a limit of INR15,000 per day or INR100,000 monthly for person-to-person (P2P) transfers, which are electronic money transfers between individuals through an intermediary.Laxmi Prasad Prasai, director of Nepal Rastra Bank’s payment department, said the national payment switch may take longer.“The national payment switch has not been finalised. Once the switch is completed, the retail payment switch will be routed through it.” National payment switch is the core infrastructure for routing and settlement of retail transactions, ensuring the interoperability of card and non-card-based payments within Nepal. It includes a retail payment switch for handling retail (non-card) based transactions and retail instruments.The retail payment switch is an operational real-time retail payment switch with additional instruments to support virtual private address-based payment, request-to-pay-based pull transactions, interoperable QR, biller gateway, wallet interoperability, and payment system operator settlements.Card switches and domestic card schemes are currently being implemented.While sending remittances from India to Nepal under the ‘Indo-Nepal Remittance Facility Scheme’, Nepali citizens who have accounts in Indian banks and financial institutions can send remittances to Nepal using e-banking, interbank payment, mobile banking and QR codes through retail payment switch.The new guideline issued on Thursday states that remittances sent from India will be available in the Nepali currency in the beneficiaries’ bank account or e-wallet.The central bank’s circular states that the concerned banking and financial institutions and payment service providers need to minimise all risks and maximise the benefits of digital transactions.The new amended guideline provides merchant payment for the sale of goods and services by Nepali traders through QR code and other digital payment modes from Indian payment instruments issued. Nepal’s central bank has already opened the digital payment system for third countries, allowing foreign citizens to pay through a QR code for purchases in Nepal.

The development was hailed as a milestone in cross-border digital payment between Nepal and India, facilitating the students and people going to India for medical purposes.Nepal’s Fonepay Payment Service has partnered with India’s NPCI International Payments to launch the cross-border payment service using quick response (QR) codes.According to officials, Nepal’s central bank has introduced a retail payment switch to facilitate person-to-person transactions. Nepal Clearing House, a public limited company, can also transact through the retail payment switch.With the delay in implementing the National Payment Switch, the central bank has provisioned a retail switch for inter-country payment through a quick QR code system.On March 15, Nepal Rastra Bank amended the inter-country payment system through QR code guidelines and introduced a provision for Indian workers in Nepal who have accounts in Nepali banks to send money through e-banking, interbank payment, mobile banking, and QR code to Indian banks and financial institutions through the national payment switch.However, a circular published on Thursday provisioned sending money through the retail payment switch until the national payment switch comes into full operation.The central bank has set a limit of INR15,000 per day or INR100,000 monthly for person-to-person (P2P) transfers, which are electronic money transfers between individuals through an intermediary.Laxmi Prasad Prasai, director of Nepal Rastra Bank’s payment department, said the national payment switch may take longer.“The national payment switch has not been finalised. Once the switch is completed, the retail payment switch will be routed through it.” National payment switch is the core infrastructure for routing and settlement of retail transactions, ensuring the interoperability of card and non-card-based payments within Nepal. It includes a retail payment switch for handling retail (non-card) based transactions and retail instruments.The retail payment switch is an operational real-time retail payment switch with additional instruments to support virtual private address-based payment, request-to-pay-based pull transactions, interoperable QR, biller gateway, wallet interoperability, and payment system operator settlements.Card switches and domestic card schemes are currently being implemented.While sending remittances from India to Nepal under the ‘Indo-Nepal Remittance Facility Scheme’, Nepali citizens who have accounts in Indian banks and financial institutions can send remittances to Nepal using e-banking, interbank payment, mobile banking and QR codes through retail payment switch.The new guideline issued on Thursday states that remittances sent from India will be available in the Nepali currency in the beneficiaries’ bank account or e-wallet.The central bank’s circular states that the concerned banking and financial institutions and payment service providers need to minimise all risks and maximise the benefits of digital transactions.The new amended guideline provides merchant payment for the sale of goods and services by Nepali traders through QR code and other digital payment modes from Indian payment instruments issued. Nepal’s central bank has already opened the digital payment system for third countries, allowing foreign citizens to pay through a QR code for purchases in Nepal.

Along with Kathmandu of Bagmati Province, the outbreak of the deadly disease was reported in several districts of Lumbini, Karnali, Sudurpaschim, Koshi, and Madhesh provinces.And in less than a year of that outbreak, health authorities concerned have been gearing up to declare the entire Madhesh Province fully immunised.“We are all prepared to declare the Madhesh Province fully immunised,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “All the districts of Madhesh Province have been already declared fully covered, and we have decided to declare the province fully immunised.”To declare an area as fully immunised, all children under 15 months old residing there must be administered all vaccines of the routine immunisation programme.Child health experts doubt the claim that all eligible children of the Madhesh Province have been administered the routine vaccines. They say the decision to declare a fully immunised province could raise a sense of complacency in the public, which will ultimately backfire.“Most of the districts across the country have already been declared fully immunised, and the fact is outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, keep getting reported,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Declaration of a fully immunised province could create a sense of complacency in the public. We also declared the entire country open-defecation-free years ago, but outbreaks of waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea and cholera, have not stopped.”Experts say many districts across the country have already been declared fully literate but it’s hard to believe that all the districts are indeed fully literate.“For the last four months, we have been launching extensive vaccination programmes to achieve the target of a fully immunised province,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, chief of the Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “We have also carried out the survey and found 100 percent of children between 15 to 23 months are immunised.”Experts, however, say it is impossible to achieve fully immunised status, as babies are born every hour and every day. Coverage of most health programmes is low in Madhesh Province compared to districts of other provinces. People of certain communities go to maternal homes for child delivery and return months after, and the risk of missing the routine vaccination is high there, according to them.Vaccine coverage is low among people living along the Nepal-India border who keep travelling to India frequently. Most of them opt out of vaccine programmes run by both Nepal and India. Health experts say low vaccination coverage, internal migration, a lack of awareness of importance of vaccines, and government apathy are among the reasons for regular outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.“Due to cross border movements, the trend to go to maternal homes for child delivery, lack of awareness about the importance of vaccination and hygiene and sanitation conditions, risk of children missing routine vaccines is high in Madhesh Province,” said Upreti. “More than the declaration of full immunisation, sustaining that status is very crucial. Childhood vaccination is a continuous process, which never ends, meaning that the target is never achieved.”The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, showed that at least four percent of children aged 12 to 23 months have received no vaccination.The number of children missing basic antigens in the routine immunisation programme in Madhesh Province was also staggering. According to the report, the immunisation coverage rate in Madhesh Province is only 68 percent, which means 32 percent of children in the province didn’t take all the vaccines. It is the lowest of all the seven provinces.The government provides 13 types of vaccines through the national immunisation programme. Gandaki Province has a 93 percent vaccine coverage rate, the highest in the country. The vaccine coverage in Sudurpaschim Province, which is considered less developed and less educated, is 89 percent.The vaccination coverage rate is 81 percent in Koshi, 83 percent in Bagmati, 85 percent in Lumbini, and 84 percent in Karnali Province.Immunisation is considered the most cost-effective and efficient way to control and eliminate vaccine-preventable diseases that contribute to childhood illnesses and deaths. ","summary":"After a 2022 measles outbreak, Madhesh Province is preparing to declare full immunization despite doubts and low coverage in some areas, highlighting challenges in sustaining immunization efforts and controlling vaccine-preventable diseases."},{"hash":"ad7a7a2ab50b9d4723101af69f807506b6eacb0d670adb9ff2ac89c7f370abd7","title":"over-1-000-people-infected-with-swine-flu-virus-since-january","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/health/2024/06/25/over-1-000-people-infected-with-swine-flu-virus-since-january","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/thumb6-1719279220.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1719273600000,"source":"kp","category":"health","content":"At least 1,072 people from across the country have been infected with A(H1N1), also known as the swine flu virus, since January, this year.Data provided by the National Public Health Laboratory shows that 373 others were infected with the influenza B virus, 75 with the A (H3) virus, also known as Hong Kong Flu, 13 with co-infection of swine flu and coronavirus, and two with co-infection of influenza B and coronavirus. What concerns public virologists and infectious disease experts in Nepal is that less than one-fifth of cases of influenza-like illnesses are diagnosed, and neither the doctors attending patients nor the authorities concerned bother to know the real cause of ailments. They say that of the swab samples of 8,739 people with an influenza-like illness, only 1,743 tested positive for various kinds of influenza. “The cause of ailments of the rest of people are not known, which should be a cause of serious concern to the researchers as well as policymakers,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “The criteria for collecting the swab samples for influenza test is that patients should have an influenza-like illness, but only less than one-fifth of samples are testing positive for influenza.”The laboratory only maintains a record of the positive cases but does not tell anything about fatalities due to infections. Experts say the number of people infected with influenza could be several times higher than the data provided by the laboratory, as many people suffering from influenza-like illness do not seek treatment. Even for those who do seek treatment, in most cases, the underlying cause of their ailments often remains undiagnosed. “The next pandemic could also be a pandemic of respiratory viruses,” said Pun. “We will not be able to lessen the risk of outbreaks in future if we continue ignoring the risks.

It is far beyond the usual pain and cannot be managed with medication–she’s tried that multiple times. Taking one dose of Meftal (a period pain medication) is never enough. The pain is debilitating most of the time.Despite several visits to gynaecologists, her complaints have been brushed aside as normal period pains. She strongly feels that her pain is abnormal, but feels powerless to address her issues.“The pain is so bad, but I cannot do anything about it,” she says. “I can’t count the number of times that I’ve been told that my debilitating pain is normal,” bemoans Ekta, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy.The normalisation of period pains means serious reproductive conditions like endometriosis often go untreated. People with endometriosis experience severe pelvic pain because tissues like that found outside the uterus grow inside it. Other symptoms of the condition include heavy bleeding during and between periods and fatigue. There is no known cure for this condition, and symptoms can start from the first period onwards.A major challenge experienced by women with endometriosis is the disregard of their symptoms by the public and medical professionals alike. Due to lack of awareness about the debilitating pain typical to endometriosis, both the person suffering from the condition, and their doctors often underestimate their severity.Severe pelvic pain is a key indicator for diagnosing endometriosis, says Dr Reena Shrestha, a gynaecologist at Madhyapur Hospital. When patients seek consultation regarding the kind of severe pain that significantly disrupts their lives, they may undergo two types of tests: transvaginal ultrasound and diagnostic laparoscopy. These procedures are used to determine the presence of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a complex condition, says Dr Hema Pradhan, a consultant gynaecologist at Everest Hospital. Amongst all the patients she meets at her consultations, many frequently turn out to have endometriosis. But, she’s noticed that often patients often delay seeking treatment because period pains are often normalised.“Women who come to me with their symptoms often delay seeking treatment, because, regardless of the severity of their pain, they believe all period pains to be normal,” says Pradhan.Eighteen-year-old Rima (name change) has been struggling with excessive pain before and during periods for years. She also experiences pain while urinating during her periods. Rima has also been diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). The co-occurence of PCOS and endometriosis is not unheard of, although research on them has been minimal.“I can barely walk when I’m on my periods, but I’ve always been told that I should just learn to live with it,” she says.Despite knowing about PCOS, she discovered the possibility of having endometriosis quite later in life. She shares this because period pain, even excessive ones, have been normalised for far too long.The general lack of awareness of endometriosis, and widespread normalisation of period pains, often results in late diagnosis and treatment of the condition.Although there may be no cure to the condition, there are ways to manage its most severe symptoms. Furthermore, receiving a diagnosis can greatly help patients to understand the severity of their condition, according to doctors. “I’m incapable of doing anything during my periods. One time I had to leave the examination in the middle of my exams because of the pain,” says Ekta. “I can’t study, can’t work, all I can do is stay in bed and cry,” she adds.Dr Pradhan reveals another challenging aspect of diagnosing endometriosis. Sometimes the condition may not appear on ultrasound scans initially. Endometrial deposits may appear differently in women due to hormonal changes. Furthermore, symptoms may vary, with some being asymptomatic altogether. According to Dr Shrestha, once a gynaecologist confirms that the patient has endometriosis, they will certainly recommend methods to manage the pain. These include analgesics for pain relief, and home remedies like hot water bag massage.However, the main problem remains. Due to lack of awareness, most patients may only find out about their condition later in life.In some cases women only discover they have endometriosis when they face infertility. Endometriosis is associated with infertility, and 30-50% of people with endometriosis may experience infertility. This also exposes another troubling aspect associated with endometriosis. Ekta shares that her relatives often express concerns about her potential infertility.“They just make me feel bad that I might never get pregnant. And it makes me feel worse,” Ekta adds.Worldwide, endometriosis has been known as a scientifically under-researched condition. It has even been called the ‘missed disease’ because of inconsistencies in its diagnosis and treatment. Endometriosis has also been widely ignored by policy makers.Treatment for endometriosis depends on the individual, says Dr Pradhan. Some are treated with hormonal medication, and others require surgical procedures. The main way to combat endometriosis is timely diagnosis, and timely treatment, she adds.“Raising awareness, timely diagnosis, and treatment are very important,” Dr Pradhan says.

Doctors at the National Cardiac Center, who attended to the patient prescribed medicines and advised her to change her lifestyle and eating habits to control the ailments.“The patient, who was worried about her health conditions, took the doctors’ advice seriously and joined a yoga class in the morning, made a drastic change in her eating habits, and engaged in physical activities,” said Dr Om Murti Anil, a senior cardiologist. “Her blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels are now under control, and she has also reduced her weight. Now, she doesn't need the high dose of medicines like in the past. ”This was a common refrain among a few patients, who took doctors' advice seriously, changed their lifestyles and eating habits, joined yoga classes, and increased physical activity, which helped them control high blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels.Public health experts say changing eating habits, lessening body weight, and starting physical activities, including yoga and physical exercises, help control non-communicable diseases, which have emerged as a major public health problem in Nepal.Studies show that non-communicable diseases have emerged as a serious public health issue in Nepal, accounting for around 80 percent of total deaths. A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases found that they accounted for 71 percent of the deaths in the country. The study primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption—and biological risk factors—raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. The findings showed that the leading risk factor for death in 2019 was smoking, accounting for 17.7 percent deaths, followed by high systolic blood pressure at 12.3 percent, household air pollution at 11.2 percent, ambient air pollution at 9.3 percent, diabetes at 8 percent, as well as high cholesterol, kidney dysfunction.Additionally, around 8 percent of the deaths were attributed to accidents, including road traffic accidents.“For many patients, doctors have to increase the doses of medicines, as every time they come for follow-up, their reports often get worse,” said Anil. “To reduce weight, change lifestyle and eating habits, strong commitments are needed, and very few people have such determination.”Many patients, despite knowing that they are at high risk of dying due to inactivity, do not change their lifestyle or start physical activity. Doctors warn that non-communicable diseases—hypertension, heart disease, stroke and diabetes, among others—could lead to a public health crisis if not addressed immediately. They blame a sedentary lifestyle and the consumption of processed foods as chief culprits for the growing burden of non-communicable diseases and obesity.They warn that people from all walks of life have been affected by the repercussions of changing lifestyles and food habits. Entire family members suffer if any member, particularly the breadwinner, faces serious health problems.Experts say continuous awareness campaigns about the rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases, the promotion of healthy lifestyles, and the start of yoga classes in community centres, schools, and open-air gyms could help lessen the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. “Physical exercises not only help in managing the disease conditions but also lessen the risk of developing non-communicable diseases,” said Dr Munkarna Thapa, information officer at the Department of Ayurveda and Alternative Medicine. “Along with physical fitness, they contribute to the mental well-being of people.”Meanwhile, department officials said that they have allocated a budget to promote open-air fitness centres, yoga classes, and alternatives, keeping in mind the growing burden of non-communicable diseases in society.Open-air gyms have been set up in public places, and the public can use them free of charge. Apart from setting up outdoor gyms, imparting training to communities and school students and promoting healthy lifestyles to reduce the major risk factors associated with non-communicable diseases, Thapa said.The department, which has already set up open-air fitness centres at the headquarters of all seven provinces, plans to set up 10 more such centres in the upcoming fiscal year. Several local units also have set up such facilities in their areas. ","summary":"A 45-year-old woman from Dhapasi, Kathmandu was diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes some six months ago. Doctors at the National Cardiac Center, who attended to the patient prescribed medicines and advised her to change her lifestyle and eating habits to control the ailments.“The patient, who was worried about her health conditions, took the doctors’ advice seriously and joined a yoga class in the morning, made a drastic change in her eating habits, and engaged in physical activities,” said Dr Om Murti Anil, a senior cardiologist. “Her blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels are now under control, and she has also reduced her weight. Now, she doesn't need the high dose of medicines like in the past. ”This was a common refrain among a few patients, who took doctors' advice seriously, changed their lifestyles and eating habits, joined yoga classes, and increased physical activity, which helped them control high blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels.Public health experts say changing eating habits, lessening body weight, and starting physical activities, including yoga and physical exercises, help control non-communicable diseases, which have emerged as a major public health problem in Nepal.Studies show that non-communicable diseases have emerged as a serious public health issue in Nepal, accounting for around 80 percent of total deaths. A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases found that they accounted for 71 percent of the deaths in the country. The study primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption—and biological risk factors—raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. The findings showed that the leading risk factor for death in 2019 was smoking, accounting for 17.7 percent deaths, followed by high systolic blood pressure at 12.3 percent, household air pollution at 11.2 percent, ambient air pollution at 9.3 percent, diabetes at 8 percent, as well as high cholesterol, kidney dysfunction.Additionally, around 8 percent of the deaths were attributed to accidents, including road traffic accidents.“For many patients, doctors have to increase the doses of medicines, as every time they come for follow-up, their reports often get worse,” said Anil. “To reduce weight, change lifestyle and eating habits, strong commitments are needed, and very few people have such determination.”Many patients, despite knowing that they are at high risk of dying due to inactivity, do not change their lifestyle or start physical activity.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon.

But his up-and-down evening could deepen voter concerns that the 81-year-old is too old to serve another four-year term.Trump, meanwhile, unleashed a barrage of criticisms, some of which were well-worn falsehoods he has repeated on the campaign trial, including claims that migrants have carried out a crime wave and that Democrats support infanticide.Biden and Trump, 78, were under pressure to display their command of issues and avoid verbal gaffes as they sought a breakout moment in a race that opinion polls show has been deadlocked for months. Biden, in particular, has been dogged by questions about his age and sharpness, while Trump’s incendiary rhetoric and sprawling legal woes remain a vulnerability.Asked about the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters, the former president refused to accept any responsibility and claimed that many of those arrested were innocent.“This guy has no sense of American democracy,” Biden scoffed in response.Biden also blamed Trump for enabling the elimination of a nationwide right to abortion by appointing conservatives to the US Supreme Court, an issue that has bedeviled Republicans since 2022.Trump countered that Biden would not support any limits on abortions and said that returning the issue to the states was the right course of action.Trump said Biden had failed to secure the southern US border, ushering in scores of criminals.“I call it Biden migrant crime,” he said.Biden replied, “Once again, he’s exaggerating, he’s lying.”Studies show immigrants do not commit crimes at a higher rate than native-born Americans.The televised clash on CNN was taking place far earlier than any modern presidential debate, more than four months before the Nov. 5 Election Day.The two candidates appeared with no live audience, and their microphones automatically cut off when it was not their turn to speak - both atypical rules imposed to avoid the chaos that derailed their first debate in 2020, when Trump interrupted Biden repeatedly.As the debate began, the two men - who have made little secret of their mutual dislike - did not shake hands or acknowledge one another.But there were plenty more moments in which their bad blood was evident. Each called the other the worst president in history; Biden referred to Trump as a “loser” and a “whiner,” while Trump called Biden a “disaster.”At one point, the rivals bickered over their golf games, with Trump bragging about hitting the ball farther than Biden and Biden retorting that Trump would struggle to carry his own bag.POLARIZED NATIONThe first questions focused on the economy, as polls show Americans are dissatisfied with Biden’s performance despite wage growth and low unemployment.Biden acknowledged that inflation had driven prices substantially higher than at the start of his term but said he deserves credit for putting “things back together again” following the coronavirus pandemic.Trump asserted that he had overseen “the greatest economy in the history of our country” before the pandemic struck and said he took action to prevent the economic freefall from deepening even further.The debate took place at a time of profound polarization and deep-seated anxiety among voters about the state of American politics. Two-thirds of voters said in a May Reuters/Ipsos poll that they were concerned violence could follow the election, nearly four years after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol.Trump took the stage as a felon who still faces a trio of criminal cases, including to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The former president, who persists in falsely claiming his defeat was the result of fraud, has suggested he will punish his political enemies if returned to power, but he will need to convince undecided voters that he does not pose a mortal threat to democracy, as Biden asserts.Biden’s challenge was to deliver a forceful performance after months of Republican assertions that his faculties have dulled with age.While national polls show a tied race, Biden has trailed Trump in polls of most battleground states that traditionally decide presidential elections. Just this month he lost his financial edge over Trump, whose fundraising surged after he was criminally convicted of trying to cover up hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels.Neither Biden nor Trump is popular and many Americans remain deeply ambivalent about their choices. About a fifth of voters say they have not picked a candidate, are leaning toward a third-party candidate or may sit the election out, the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed.Trump’s niece Mary Trump, who has been critical of her uncle, will join Biden’s campaign in its media spin room following the debate, a campaign official said.Several contenders to be Trump’s vice presidential pick - North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and US senators J.D. Vance and Marco Rubio - traveled to Atlanta and were expected to make Trump’s case in the post-debate spin room.The second and final debate in this year’s campaign is scheduled for September.

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

After 14 years of an arduous accession process that began in 1989, the fifth WTO Ministerial Meeting in 2003 approved Nepal's membership, and the country formally joined the organisation in April 2004 after the government ratified it. Nepal had two main reasons to enter into the multilateral trading system, despite its complexities. First, it was indispensable for Nepal to fill the void in its external trade caused by the termination of its trade and transit agreements with India, which shared almost 90 percent of the country’s external trade at that time. Second, the multilateral trading system could help diversify Nepal’s India-dominated external trade with third countries, as stipulated in its plans and policies until the late 80s. Nepal’s objectives in joining the WTO were to guarantee transit rights and trade diversification under non-discriminatory treatment in trade with its partners, as assured by the basic norms of the multilateral trading system. However, Nepal’s affiliation to the WTO can also be evaluated for other reasons. When Nepal joined the WTO, the WTO Doha Round of trade negotiations, initiated in 2001 (yet to be concluded), was at the centre of global attention because it embraced the interests of both developed and developing countries. The Doha Round has special bearings for Nepal. Renowned for the understanding to cut agriculture subsidies and tariffs as well as to improve market access for non-agriculture products, the essence of the Doha Round for the least-developed countries (LDCs), including Nepal, rested on the introduction of preferential market access for the first time under the multilateral system. It was later incorporated into the Doha agenda as a duty- and quota-free programme. The agenda included trade capacity building provision through the Aid for Trade programme to compensate for trade losses of such countries due to the erosion of preference as world average tariff rates are reduced under the multilateral system. This suggested that the value of trade preference would diminish with the erosion of preference margins for Nepal’s trade, whereas the preference would gradually lose its importance after Nepal graduates from LDC status in 2026. The LDC-specific preference is not permitted for non-LDCs under different preferential schemes, including the popular Generalised System of Preference programme. Thus, Nepal’s fate in the WTO will eventually depend on its trade efficiency and trade policy rather than the preferential treatment. Nepal must do many things to reap the benefits of its WTO membership. First and foremost, it is necessary to assess our bilateral trade agreements vis-à-vis the country’s current trade regime, which is already under the multilateral system. Except for the trade treaty with India, Nepal’s other bilateral agreements seem redundant in this context. Nepal’s trade agreement with India includes partially reciprocal trade preferences at its core and goes deeper than the multilateral system. However, the rest of the others are confined to the most favoured nation (MFN) treatment concerning customs tariffs and trade procedures, almost equivalent to the WTO’s MFN treatment or the principle of trade without discrimination. That means such agreements are superfluous unless they have distinctive features from the WTO system. Therefore, Nepal should revise the bilateral agreements, giving due consideration to the issues that do not fall under the WTO mechanism. For example, the bilateral trade negotiations could be an effective means to sort out the problem of non-tariff measures (NTMs), which are intense in Nepal’s trade enhancement and diversification initiative. The NTMs have been problematic even during the WTO negotiations. Paradoxically, the domestically ingrained NTMs are more detrimental to Nepal’s trade endeavour than the non-tariff barriers subjected to its trade with partners, according to a study by the International Trade Centre. In addition to the challenges, there is a rationale behind Nepal’s membership in the WTO. One of the most significant aspects is the predictable trading environment guaranteed by the WTO principles, which are based on non-discrimination, fair trade and transparency. Furthermore, in the case of unfair trade practices, the WTO has contingency measures, such as anti-dumping and countervailing duties, to defend the country’s trade interests from such incidents. And there is a powerful dispute settlement mechanism at its disposal to sort out the trade wrangling, if any. These measures are worthwhile as the country’s trade expands.It is worth mentioning some achievements Nepal made after entering the WTO. Backed by the policy of free trade, Nepal’s exports have grown steadily in the face of escalated import trade since it pursued the multilateralism policy. The liberalisation of import trade has helped the country diversify its exports through comparative advantage. Nepal’s achievement in the area of service trade cannot be undermined with respect to export prospects and diversification. Besides these accomplishments, Nepal has also made strides in trade-related laws. While the rules on intellectual property rights—one of the strict WTO requirements—have been introduced, the laws dealing with competition and anti-dumping, which are prerequisites to international business, are also effective now. However, this is not the end of the challenges. Nepal’s benefits from WTO membership will rely on its dedication to an enabling trading environment. This will also depend on its ability to adapt to the multilateral trading system, which is facing a credibility crisis following the Doha deadlock and the growing threat of protectionism in recent years.           ","summary":"Nepal’s membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), a multilateral trading system, marked 20 years in April 2024.

Even normal rainfall poses challenges. Stagnant rainwater becomes a fertile breeding ground for mosquitoes. Consequently, vector-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria affect entire neighbourhoods, leaving municipal health services in severe stress.Over the last few years, there has been a surge in dengue cases in smaller towns and peri-urban areas, in states where dengue was unknown a decade ago.

The Indian experience shows that untimely and inadequate response from health systems has disproportionately impacted the poor and marginalised, who lack resources to cope with health catastrophes and challenges.This is compounded by poor living conditions, inadequate social and family support systems, lack of information, lack of political and social capital, inadequate financial resources and adverse work conditions.

While the National Urban Health Mission has made modest beginnings in improving primary care systems in urban areas, the limited and varied ability of urban local bodies in generating revenues constrain progress.In India, public spending on health remains in per capita terms. A National Health Accounts India report says that the per capita current public spending on health was around Rs1,555 ($18.6) in 2019-20.Bhutan’s spending on health was two-and-a-half times more than India’s, while Sri Lanka’s was three times more. Many BRICS nations spent 14-15 times more than India.A paltry sum—2.69 percent—of the total government budget is spent through local bodies. This translates to Rs42 per capita—or just 50 US cents—a measly amount given the magnitude of the challenges. Much of the spending happens in larger municipal corporations and metropolitan cities, while preventive health action remains largely absent in smaller towns and rural bodies.A special fund from statutory institutions such as the Finance Commission, to be targeted towards building a resilient system for vulnerable areas, is urgently needed.

In Patna, the Bihar capital, anecdotal reports indicated more deaths. Protocols clearly spell out that multiple verifications are needed to ascertain dengue or malaria cases and deaths attributable to these diseases.A moribund health system dealing with epidemic-like conditions often does not have the capacity for due diligence and therefore cases and deaths go unreported. Besides, there is limited compliance from the private sector and lack of appreciation within policy institutions for building an eco-system for robust data which can feed into local planning and implementation.Systems such as the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), established to monitor and strengthen disease outbreaks by putting together a decentralised surveillance system for epidemic prone diseases, needs to be universal and comprehensive.Very little is spent on epidemiological surveillance, risk, and disease control programmes (2.77 percent)—only Rs 43 (US $0.50) per capita. Only Rs 1,944 crore ($238,698.35) was spent on preparation on disaster and emergency response programmes, which constitutes only 0.33 percent of total public spending.With the complex nature of the health and climate crisis, the current system of vertical disease control programmes, which create parallel systems for different diseases (such as tuberculosis) or set of diseases (vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue etc), need to give way to a comprehensive health system approach in management of public health programmes.An immediate step towards this could be integration of frontline workers across various disease management programmes to create a cadre of multipurpose frontline public health professionals in urban areas, who would be accountable to communities as well as to the health system.Such integration will also likely address one of the key challenges in India’s public health sphere—shortage of adequately trained workforce in health and allied areas.-360info ","summary":"While much of India was reeling under intense and prolonged heat, the tiny northeastern state of Sikkim recently faced flash floods that left nine people dead and stranded 1,200 tourists.

As he was sentenced to time he had already served in prison, he was allowed to head home to Australia.Assange’s freedom has come as a relief to his supporters across the globe, especially so for those who value the disclosures made by the company he founded, WikiLeaks. In November 2010, WikiLeaks had released over 250,000 US diplomatic cables with the help of Chelsea Manning, a former US army soldier who was convicted under the US Espionage Act and had her sentence commuted by President Barack Obama. The WikiLeaks exposed, among other things, the fact that the US forces in Baghdad had killed 11 people in a 2007 helicopter attack; criticism of the UK’s military operation in Afghanistan by US commanders and the Afghan president; and thousands of US diplomatic cables that revealed how the US used its embassies for espionage. In 2016, WikiLeaks again came to prominence after exposing thousands of hacked emails of the Democratic National Committee, causing a possible setback for the US Democratic Party presidential candidate Hilary Clinton. WikiLeaks was then accused of collaborating with the Russian government to influence the US presidential elections, which Donald Trump, Clinton’s opponent, won.Shaken by the incriminating revelations on their modus operandi, Western nations, led by the US, launched an all-out war against Assange and WikiLeaks. Assange’s global legitimacy took a hit after Sweden’s abortive attempt to prosecute him for sexual allegations and the Ecuadorian Embassy’s allegation of rude behaviour while staying with them as a refugee-guest. Beyond the questions of his personal conduct, though, Assange continued to be considered a victim of the Western world’s crusade against the free press. Assange found his champions, among other global intellectuals, in Noam Chomsky and Arundhati Roy, both of whom condemned the US government’s anti-democratic attempts at silencing a journalist-crusader. In a strange turn of events, Roy, Indian writer known for speaking on behalf of the freedom of the country’s impoverished Adivasis and Dalits, now faces sedition charges in her home country for a speech she made in 2010. The hounding of Roy is a clear case of the Indian government, led by the right-wing strongman Narendra Modi, silencing dissenting voices. In Nepal, Kailash Sirohiya, the publisher of The Kathmandu Post, spent nine days in jail last month and continues to face prosecution for an alleged forgery of citizenship certificates while in reality, he is being hounded for his publication’s consistent coverage of the corruption allegations against Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane. The abuse of authority to silence journalists, intellectuals and dissenters is a global phenomenon today.

The hounding of Roy is a clear case of the Indian government, led by the right-wing strongman Narendra Modi, silencing dissenting voices. In Nepal, Kailash Sirohiya, the publisher of The Kathmandu Post, spent nine days in jail last month and continues to face prosecution for an alleged forgery of citizenship certificates while in reality, he is being hounded for his publication’s consistent coverage of the corruption allegations against Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane. The abuse of authority to silence journalists, intellectuals and dissenters is a global phenomenon today. Julian Assange’s ordeal is a reality check of the price one must pay for speaking truth to power.  "},{"hash":"7b7e5baf7471a6959b5d4c4c11dca45baba14b0da8a7b4a1e837a48e0d46be44","title":"mind-the-mining","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/06/25/mind-the-mining","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/thumb-1719334381.png&w=900&height=601","date":1719273600000,"source":"kp","category":"editorial","content":"Haphazard road construction in hills and illegal riverbed extraction down in the plains have become all too common in Nepal.

Yet the Nepali state appears largely unbothered. A recent Post report about the illegal extraction at the Kalakhola area in Baglung Municipality-13, which has put an under-construction “industrial village” and settlements in the area at heightened risk of erosion, captures the disasters such activities can invite. Thanks to haphazard extraction, the Kaligandaki River has reportedly altered its course, increasing the risk of flooding in nearby settlements and affecting the area set aside for industries. This, however, isn’t an isolated case. Every year, hundreds of people lose their lives due to landslides brought about by the construction of feeder roads connected to national highways. Roads constructed just above people’s roofs have also taken a toll on lives and property. Of course, it is illegal to bulldoze riverbeds and build shoddy roads. In 2020, the Supreme Court banned extraction activities to protect the Kaligandaki and the settlements near the river. Similarly, the Public Road Act (1974), Section 19 prohibits building an access road joined to the public road without permission from the department of roads. Local and provincial governments are mainly responsible for constructing auxiliary roads, while local governments are tasked with monitoring and regulating extraction activities. But the political support for the illegal extractors, locals’ necessity for road connectivity, and, most importantly, the fact that many local level representatives are contractors have made it difficult to stop these illegal activities at the local level. In many cases, local representatives flout the laws and use their excavators to build connecting roads. As a part of the asare vikas, they spend the bulk of the budget only at the end of the fiscal year. Roads, as a result, are built without proper study, environmental impact and need assessment. Federal apathy has further emboldened the illegal extractors and unscrupulous constructors. We should be mindful of what negligence and encroachments can do to our natural resources. On the one hand, the government advocates for environmental protection but on the other, it continues to blatantly overlook the issue. This is perhaps because the extraction of riverbed materials has become a lucrative business. For example, as the country is self-sufficient in cement production, with the capacity to produce 17 million tonnes, the authorities perhaps don’t want to lose that point of pride. But people’s health and wellbeing should always come first. The pursuit of development and profits should, as such, not overshadow environmental concerns. Now that the monsoon is upon us, many places will see illegal road construction and riverbed extraction. In order to forestall more damage to life and property, the first order of business must be to identify areas where unsustainable extraction has taken place as well as the roads that need immediate repair. Contractors and licensed miners should be mandated to follow the environmental impact guidelines, and if they fail, their licences should be revoked. If the government can hold them to account and implement stringent policies, precious lives and natural resources can be saved. Only by being proactive and factoring in long-term sustainability can we save our environment and protect our wellbeing as well as of the generations to come.  ","summary":"Haphazard road construction in hills and illegal riverbed extraction down in the plains have become all too common in Nepal.

What are the takeaways of the prime minister’s Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government’s decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country’s foreign policy doesn’t change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government’s priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn’t it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn’t affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country’s ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person’s affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn’t seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister’s New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister’s visit doesn’t reflect any misgivings about the government’s decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn’t reflect that. Why aren’t we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country’s views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don’t see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats’ relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don’t get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country’s influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let’s move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister’s level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister’s emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal’s official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister’s Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report’s submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India’s facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour’s support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India’s infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal’s electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven’t developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don’t envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn’t the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects—domestic as well as international use—of the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It’s been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why haven’t we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon. ","summary":"The government’s recent decision to recall ambassadors, particularly Nepal’s envoy to India, just ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to New Delhi, courted widespread controversy. What are the takeaways of the prime minister’s Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government’s decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country’s foreign policy doesn’t change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government’s priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn’t it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn’t affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country’s ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person’s affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn’t seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister’s New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister’s visit doesn’t reflect any misgivings about the government’s decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn’t reflect that. Why aren’t we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country’s views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don’t see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats’ relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don’t get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country’s influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let’s move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister’s level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister’s emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal’s official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister’s Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report’s submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India’s facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour’s support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India’s infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal’s electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven’t developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don’t envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn’t the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects—domestic as well as international use—of the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It’s been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries.
