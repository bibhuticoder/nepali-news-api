The report named, 'Climate Finance Provided and Mobilised by Developed Countries in 2013-2022', said, \"In 2022, developed countries provided and mobilised a total of USD 115.9 billion in climate finance for developing countries, thereby reaching their collective annual goal of mobilizing USD 100 billion for climate action in developing countries for the first time.\"The document has further argued the climate financing was realized two years after the initial target year, 2020 and a year before the extended time, 2025. The issue of non-compliance of 100 billion US dollars by the developed countries had resounded the COP26.

With temperatures on the rise and the monsoon season approaching, the local government has cautioned residents about the heightened risk of dengue.\nAccording to the advisory, the proliferation of mosquito larvae is expected to increase with the onset of rainfall, further amplifying the risk of infection.

Everest by Tenzing Norgay Sherpa and Sir Edmund Hillary in 1953. Celebrated globally as International Everest Day, this day honors the indomitable spirit of these climbers.In the UK, Aayo Gorkhali, a venture based in Stafford and initiated by a team of ex-British Gurkhas, commemorated the 71st Everest Day with the UK premiere of 'Beyond the Summit.' This short film showcases the resilience of Guinness record holder Phurba Tenjing Sherpa, who recently completed his 16th successful ascent of Everest.\n“It was truly an honor to watch such a powerful movie about Everest and the Sherpa people, the guardians of Everest. The scene from 2015 was very emotional. Hats off to these people who live as devotees of Everest,” expressed a local attendee.\nThe event, attended by nearly 50 locals, celebrated diverse Nepali culture with traditional elements like Silam-Sakma, a symbol of Limbu tribal community and dinner on lapte, a leaf plate made up of the Sal tree, representing Newar community. Guests heard inspiring stories from Everest summiteers Rojita Buddhacharya and Rakesh Sunuwar.\nBuddhacharya, an astrophysicist, actor and journalist, who led the first women journalists to Everest in 2018, shared her journey of overcoming prejudices. “When I look back at our Everest journey, it wouldn’t have been possible without the warm embrace of Mother Chomolungma herself and our Sherpa guides. You can climb Everest without oxygen but not without Sherpas”.\nSunuwar, an ex-British Gurkha and director of Doko Homes, climbed Everest in 2017.

This short film showcases the resilience of Guinness record holder Phurba Tenjing Sherpa, who recently completed his 16th successful ascent of Everest.\n“It was truly an honor to watch such a powerful movie about Everest and the Sherpa people, the guardians of Everest.

Hats off to these people who live as devotees of Everest,” expressed a local attendee.\nThe event, attended by nearly 50 locals, celebrated diverse Nepali culture with traditional elements like Silam-Sakma, a symbol of Limbu tribal community and dinner on lapte, a leaf plate made up of the Sal tree, representing Newar community. Guests heard inspiring stories from Everest summiteers Rojita Buddhacharya and Rakesh Sunuwar.\nBuddhacharya, an astrophysicist, actor and journalist, who led the first women journalists to Everest in 2018, shared her journey of overcoming prejudices. “When I look back at our Everest journey, it wouldn’t have been possible without the warm embrace of Mother Chomolungma herself and our Sherpa guides.

Nepal, ranked 17th in the men’s T20I, are one of the top four highest-placed associated nations in the tournament. The young guns, led by 21-year-old captain Rohit Paudel, have the potential to cause an upset at the cricket tournament’s biggest stage and will aim to make history by progressing from the group stage.The top two teams from each of the four groups will reach the Super Eight stage. But their recent form—and a group including three full member nations and surprise elements the Netherlands—suggests that making it into the Super Eight will be difficult.Nepal will be making their first appearance at the World Cup since the World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014. They have never qualified for the 50-over Cricket World Cup and are the least experienced side in the group.They are heading into the World Cup following a series of disappointing results, including the ACC Men’s T20 Premier Cup debacle and a heavy 63-run warm-up defeat against Canada.Inconsistencies with the bat have been one of their biggest headaches so far.Openers Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh have failed to live up to the billing lately, resulting in a failure to give the team a good start. Three years ago, on April 17, 2021, when the duo fearlessly put on a record-breaking 116-run opening stand against the Netherlands in their T20I debut in Kirtipur during the Nepal Tri-Nation T20I Series, the impression was that Nepal had finally found the missing piece of their top batting order.However, questions have been raised over their form as the opening duo has failed to build any impressive partnership recently, especially this year.Bhurtel—despite being one of the three Nepali batters alongside Paudel and Dipendra Singh Airee to have crossed 1,000 T20I runs—is experiencing the worst year of his career and is showing no signs of improvement. In his last four T20I innings, he was dismissed for three ducks in a row during the Premier Cup, and for 10 runs against Canada during the World Cup warm-up. In between, he played knocks of 16, 2, 1 and 13 against West Indies A.Shiekh has also been unsteady with the bat. He scored a fifty against West Indies A and 22 against Canada in the World Cup warm-up but failed to cross double-digit figures in his previous four outings.Nepal’s batting display will heavily rely on skipper Paudel, who usually bats at number three, and big-hitter finisher Airee.Paudel is the most consistent batter in the Nepal squad. He is at his prime and entering the World Cup having scored 265 runs in his four innings that included a century and two half-centuries against West Indies A.Allrounder Airee holds the record for fastest T20I fifty. More recently, he entered the elite club when he smashed six sixes in an over against Qatar during the T20I Premier Cup, becoming the only third man to do so after Yuvraj Singh in 2007 and Keiron Pollard in 2021.Airee will certainly be the trump card of Nepal’s batting order at the World Cup.Kushal Malla, whose 34-ball hundred against Mongolia is the second fastest T20I century, is also expected to kindle fireworks.Nepal’s bowling unit will be another key strength at the World Cup, as they demonstrated in the warm-up game against Canada. They proved effective in the middle overs and struck five times in the space of 27 deliveries to limit Canada from 111-2 in the 14th over to 135-7 in the 18th over.All-rounder Sompal Kami—the only player from Nepal’s 2014 World Cup squad to feature in the 2024 edition—will bring hordes of experience in the bowling department and will lead the fast bowling alongside cult hero Karan KC, who is the highest wicket-taker in Nepal’s squad with 90 wickets from 68 innings.Lalit Rajbanshi will lead the spin threat alongside Sagar Dhakal, who is proving his worth by taking seven wickets in his last four matches.However, all eyes will be on Abinash Bohara, who will be crucial for Nepal at the back end of the innings as the majority of his wickets have come in the death overs. Since making his debut in 2019, Bohara has taken 74 wickets from 56 innings, which is the third highest for Nepal.Nepal will still be the heavy underdogs in the group, especially against 2014 world champions Sri Lanka and 2009 and 2014 semi-finalists South Africa. This will be the first time Nepal will face Sri Lanka and South Africa. Paudel, who is the youngest captain in the United States and the West Indies among the 20 participating nations, believes Nepal can do well at the World Cup. “I have faith in my team. They will give their best, be it in opening batting or other departments,” said Paudel, who added that the role of openers would be important. “It is upon the opening batters to get the team off to a good start,” he added.“In T20 cricket, no team is really a favourite. The Netherlands defeated Sri Lanka in the warm-up game. The United States beat Bangladesh twice for a historic 2-1 series victory. That’s why I believe we can and we will [compete].”If Nepal are to build momentum for the Super Eight stage, they will need to overcome their first hurdle against familiar foes Netherlands, who are making their fifth appearance at the T20 World Cup. But it will not be an easy task against the tricky Dutch, who are on the verge of completing a hat-trick of wins against the Proteas after defeating them in the 2022 T20 World Cup and the 2023 Cricket World Cup.“Our team is focused on the Netherlands match because it is very important for us to win that game and carry the thrust to the following matches. Our players are also well aware of their respective roles,” Paudel added.Nepal can also present a thrilling challenge to a Bangladesh team, who are reeling after hitting a new low after losing a series against inexperienced and tournament debutants, the US. The Tigers also lost to Zimbabwe by eight wickets in a T20I series earlier this month.This will be the second meeting between Nepal and Bangladesh. In fact, Bangladesh defeated Nepal by eight wickets in the group stage of the 2014 World Cup and progressed into the second round.

After the general elections in November 2022, Saroj Kumar Yadav of the same party has been leading the Madhesh government. Though the Madhesh administration introduced a few good programmes, experts say, it failed to lead the government on many fronts. “As leaders and people from Madhesh were at the forefront of advocating for the federal system, they should have done more to strengthen the system,” Sohan Shah, a Madhesh expert, told the Post. “The party not only failed to strengthen federalism but also in good governance and other parameters.”He accused the Madheshi leaders of wasting more time bargaining with the centre instead of working to strengthen the federal system.Shah adds a fresh anecdote to explain why the JSP-Nepal-led government can be termed a failure in Madhesh.The federal government allocates the budget for provinces and the local level every year under the equalisation and special grants headers. As per the rule, the provincial Cabinet, in the case of the province, and local units, submit proposals to the National Planning Commission (NPC) with a demand for grants for projects. While all local units of Madhesh submitted their proposals, the provincial government failed to do so, Shah claimed.Except for the Madhesh Province, the NPC received over 3,600 proposals from across the country for fiscal equalisation and special grants for the upcoming fiscal year, to be incorporated in the national budget.“That was sheer negligence on the part of the Madhesh government,” an NPC official told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “We did not have such an experience where a provincial government did not apply for a significant amount of the national budget.”After leading Madhesh politics for more than a decade and a half, Upendra Yadav lost the 2022 general election to CK Raut in Saptari-2. It was a severe blow to the veteran leader to lose the race to a newbie. With the slogan of good and efficient governance and an anti-corruption campaign, Raut’s party won popular support in Madhesh. The new party secured 13 seats in the provincial assembly, becoming the fourth-largest party in Madhesh. Despite this the province's government was again led by JSP-Nepal, the third-largest party with 19 seats in the assembly. However, the JSP-Nepal’s strength further diminished after the Ashok Rai faction split the party on May 5 and launched the Janata Samata Party. Upendra Yadav has challenged the split, and the case is sub judice.Of the party’s total 12 members in the federal parliament, seven have joined the Rai-led party. The assembly members in Madhesh, however, didn’t join the new party as the party formation process was immediately challenged in the court.A newcomer in provincial and national politics, Janamat has been joining and quitting governments.“Janamat Party was prepared to remain in the opposition because the party wanted nothing less than government leadership. While the UML and the Maoist Centre have decided to form a new government in Madhesh, they cannot do it without Janamat’s support, and are left with no option but to accept Janamat's candidate for new chief minister,” said Shah.The CPN-UML is the largest party in the provincial assembly, with 25 seats, and the Congress, with 22 seats, is the second-largest. However, Upendra Yadav’s party has always led the provincial government.Experts say that major issues of Madhesh cannot be addressed in a true sense until the big political parties ignore them.Chandra Kishore, a Madhesh expert, also claims that the province got nothing substantive in the seven years of federal exercise. If the political parties other than JSP-Nepal lead the province, it could be in favour of the Madheshi people in many ways, Kishor said. “Madhesh does not belong to just one Madheshi party; it belongs to the other parties as well,” Chandra Kishore told the Post. “Parties other than JSP-Nepal vying to lead the Madhesh government means they also should own the agenda of Madhesh, which is a good thing.” Chandra Kishore added that if the new political parties lead the Madhesh Province, it could bring plurality in governance. As per the agreement reached between the three parties–CPN-UML, CPN (Maoist Centre), and Janamat Party—Raut’s Janamat is most likely to lead the next government in the province. “Raut’s party could challenge Yadav’s dominance in the province with an effective governance to establish him as a key political figure of Madhesh,” said Chandra Kishore. Incumbent chief minister, Saroj Kumar Yadav, lost the majority in the assembly after the UML and the Maoist Centre withdrew their support for the government. This has set the stage for a floor test on Wednesday.To claim the position in the 107-strong assembly, the chief minister needs the support of 54 members. Though the ruling partners claim that the Unified Socialist and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP), in addition to Nagarik Unmukti and Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party, will also support the government, the Unified Socialist and the LSP remain non-committal so far.On May 30, the UML, the Maoist Centre, and the Janamat Party agreed to support Mahesh Prasad Yadav, the Janamat parliamentary party leader, as the chief minister of the Province in a meeting held in Janakpur. On May 29, Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba invited Upendra Yadav, chair of Janata Samajbadi Nepal, Mahantha Thakur, chair of LSP, and Madhav Nepal, chair of the CPN (Unified Socialist), to his residence to discuss the political equation in Madhesh. During the meeting, three opposition parties including the Unified Socialist, a federal ruling partner, had agreed to uphold the JSP-Nepal’s leadership in Madhesh Province.

The OAG letter, issued on May 6, stated that Lamichhane has no cases related to cooperatives fraud in Nepal’s courts.After a preliminary hearing on a petition by advocate Anupam Bhattarai, who has demanded that the letter should be scrapped, the court also summoned the plaintiffs and defendants on June 10 to discuss the matter before deciding whether to issue an interim order demanded by the petitioner. In his petition, Bhattarai has also demanded that Lamichhane be suspended from his Cabinet positions for the duration of the investigation into cooperatives fraud to prevent him from influencing the probe.A single bench of Justice Til Prasad Shrestha has also ordered them to produce the OAG letter as well as a complaint lodged against Lamichhane in the District Police Office, Kaski, in relation to the embezzlement of funds from the Suryadarshan Cooperative.“The defendants are ordered to be present in the court on June 10 along with the OAG’s letter issued on May 6 and the complaint filed at District Police Office Kaski on February 5,” reads the order. The court has prioritised the case.Lamichhane and Pokharel have 15 days to furnish their written clarifications as per the court order. In his petition Bhattarai has also claimed that the OAG has no authority to issue such a letter and therefore it should be scrapped.Depositors of the Suryadarshan Cooperatives, including Krishna Prasad Jaisi, had on February 5 filed a supplementary complaint naming Lamichhane in the embezzlement. However, the OAG issuing a letter four months later has claimed there are no cases against the minister.\"The court has ordered the presentation of the OAG's letter and the police complaint to ascertain the truth behind the OAG’s claim,\" said Bhattarai.At Lamichhane’s request, the OAG on May 6 issued the letter in favour of the home minister, who also chairs the Rastriya Swatantra Party. Two weeks ago, advocate Bhattarai moved the top court challenging the letter. However, the court administration refused to register the petition. Bhattarai then moved the Supreme Court challenging the court administration’s refusal to register his petition. After a hearing, a single bench of Justice Tek Prasad Dhungana directed the administration to register the petition.The petition was filed on May 30.The OAG has on different occasions favoured Lamichhane by taking decisions in his favour.On March 20 last year, the OAG had given a clean chit to Lamichhane saying there is no need to file a case against him for simultaneously holding passports of Nepal and the United States.In the May 6 letter, it said that there were no fraud cases registered against Lamichhane in Rupandehi, Chitwan and Kaski districts. Talking to the Post, officials had claimed they issued the letter as per the request from Lamichhane respecting his right to information.However, the move was widely criticised as an attempt to give a clean chit to Lamichhane in the cooperative scam. He has been criticised for using state machinery to shield himself. The court has intervened in the cooperative fraud case at a time when Parliament is also investigating the matter.A seven-member committee led by CPN-UML’s Surya Thapa has been constituted to investigate the cooperative scam.The committee is tasked with investigating credit cooperatives including those whose deposits were transferred to run the Gorkha Media Network (when Lamichhane served as its managing director) and other organisations. Ideal Yamuna Multipurpose Cooperative, Image Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sahara Saving and Cooperative, Samanata Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative, Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, Suryadarshan Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sumeru Saving and Credit Cooperative, and Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative are the ones that injected money into the Gorkha Media Network.  ","summary":"The Supreme Court on Sunday ordered Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane and Attorney General Dinmani Pokharel to explain a letter from the Office of the Attorney General (OAG).

In his petition Bhattarai has also claimed that the OAG has no authority to issue such a letter and therefore it should be scrapped.Depositors of the Suryadarshan Cooperatives, including Krishna Prasad Jaisi, had on February 5 filed a supplementary complaint naming Lamichhane in the embezzlement. However, the OAG issuing a letter four months later has claimed there are no cases against the minister.\"The court has ordered the presentation of the OAG's letter and the police complaint to ascertain the truth behind the OAG’s claim,\" said Bhattarai.At Lamichhane’s request, the OAG on May 6 issued the letter in favour of the home minister, who also chairs the Rastriya Swatantra Party. Two weeks ago, advocate Bhattarai moved the top court challenging the letter. However, the court administration refused to register the petition. Bhattarai then moved the Supreme Court challenging the court administration’s refusal to register his petition. After a hearing, a single bench of Justice Tek Prasad Dhungana directed the administration to register the petition.The petition was filed on May 30.The OAG has on different occasions favoured Lamichhane by taking decisions in his favour.On March 20 last year, the OAG had given a clean chit to Lamichhane saying there is no need to file a case against him for simultaneously holding passports of Nepal and the United States.In the May 6 letter, it said that there were no fraud cases registered against Lamichhane in Rupandehi, Chitwan and Kaski districts. Talking to the Post, officials had claimed they issued the letter as per the request from Lamichhane respecting his right to information.However, the move was widely criticised as an attempt to give a clean chit to Lamichhane in the cooperative scam. He has been criticised for using state machinery to shield himself. The court has intervened in the cooperative fraud case at a time when Parliament is also investigating the matter.A seven-member committee led by CPN-UML’s Surya Thapa has been constituted to investigate the cooperative scam.The committee is tasked with investigating credit cooperatives including those whose deposits were transferred to run the Gorkha Media Network (when Lamichhane served as its managing director) and other organisations. Ideal Yamuna Multipurpose Cooperative, Image Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sahara Saving and Cooperative, Samanata Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative, Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, Suryadarshan Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sumeru Saving and Credit Cooperative, and Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative are the ones that injected money into the Gorkha Media Network.  "},{"hash":"1806dd351b96828a3ce91b56aad8a18e0d721dc8c017ef61efa52b747112acd5","title":"powerful-storm-wipes-out-chitwan-s-banana-crop","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/06/03/powerful-storm-wipes-out-chitwan-s-banana-crop","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/bananacrop-1717394892.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1717372800000,"source":"kp","category":"money","content":"A powerful storm on Friday and Saturday destroyed most of the banana crop in eastern Chitwan, the banana association said, claiming it was the worst loss the growers had ever faced.The Chitwan Banana Producers Association has estimated that the damage could reach around Rs120 million. With vast stretches of banana farms destroyed, producers warn of imminent shortages of bananas. Ashika Malla of Tulsipur, Chitwan, who leases land and grows bananas on 11 bigah (7.45 hectares), said his crop would be ready for market in the next few weeks. But his hope shattered.“Now, nobody will buy it. It’s neither matured nor ripened. It’s a big loss.\" Malla has yet to assess the full extent of the damage. Besides crop losses, he would need nearly Rs1 million to clear the fallen banana trees and plant new ones. \"It's a big blow,” said Bishnu Hari Panta, former president of the Chitwan Banana Producers Association. Farmers say there are considerable economic consequences for this sector because only a few banana plants are left standing in the eastern part of Chitwan. It would take about seven months to start production again, and even then, it would not be back to normal.Farmers have suffered loss, and they could face a double whammy. For the last one and a half years, most have not received insurance payouts.\"We are not sure of getting the insurance payout anytime soon,\" said Panta. \"Farmers are in big distress,\" he said, adding that the government should immediately release the insurance payout. In Chitwan, banana plantation covers 3,500 bigha (2,370 hectares). Most of the plantations are in the eastern part of Chitwan. \"The eastern part of Chiwan suffered a big loss. The loss in the western part, however, is nominal,\" said Janak Raj Pant, general secretary of the association.Experts say that climate change is making storms more intense and devastating.Apart from droughts and floods, storms and hailstorms are also increasing in Nepal and are considered a major climate-related disaster.According to the National Climate Change Survey 2022, the second of its kind, released by the National Statistics Office recently, the economic losses in both farm and off-farm sectors in the last five years, as reported by households, excluding significant infrastructure damages, amounted to Rs415.44 billion.The survey report said that drought had been reported as the major disaster, affecting 65.4 percent of households, followed by diseases and insects at 54.3 percent, storms at 46.2 percent, hailstorms at 32.6 percent, floods at 28.5 percent, cold waves at 21.7 percent, landslides at 21.5 percent, and inundation at 17.5 percent.Farmers in Chitwan lament the government’s policy on insurance. Since March 14, non-life insurance companies have stopped settling claims for insured farm products after failing to receive government premium subsidies.The government is yet to clear around Rs3 billion under this heading to non-life insurance companies.“The non-payment issue in the agriculture sector has put us in difficulties. Since companies have totally stopped farm insurance, it will erode the confidence of the farmers towards insurance,” Pujan Adhikary, director of the insurance development and promotion division of the Nepal Insurance Authority, recently told a meeting.“Smallholder farmers and rural communities cannot manage climate risks by themselves without adequate financial instruments.”Crop insurance was introduced in Nepal with much fanfare. The government has been formulating directives to implement crop and livestock insurance since January 2013.Under the scheme, the government provided a 50 percent subsidy on the premium in the first year and raised it to 75 percent in the second year.The premium subsidy was again reduced to 50 percent and raised to 80 percent in 2021.When the insurance scheme started ten years ago, there were 802 claims. In the last fiscal year, the annual claims reached 36,000. The Ministry for Agriculture and Livestock Development said that the insurance scheme resumed on May 30 following a meeting chaired by Agriculture Minister Jwala Kumari Sah. In a statement, the ministry said it would immediately release Rs970 million to the insurance companies, and the remaining dues will be settled within this fiscal year or by mid-July.“The insurance companies have agreed to resume the scheme,” the ministry said in a statement.

Public health experts, however, are sceptical of its success, as neonatal deaths have not declined since 2016, and the measures taken at present are not sufficient to lessen the ongoing death rates.“Both the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 and the finance ministry’s recent report show neonatal deaths constantly high,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “It will not be easy to pick high-hanging fruits. It requires a lot of investments and micro planning, which are currently lacking.”A recent report by the Ministry of Finance shows that 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births, the same results shown by the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The 16th five-year plan, which starts next fiscal year and ends in 2029, is aligned with the SDG targets.Public health experts say meeting the goal is easier said than done. Most health facilities having birthing centres lack neonatal units, trained human resources, and quality services.“Without ensuring quality services, which require trained human resources and advanced facilities, among others, it is impossible to reduce neonatal deaths,” said Upreti. “The government has made various plans to reduce child deaths—including neonatal deaths—but does not pay much attention to their effective implementation.”The finance ministry’s recent report shows that the institutional delivery rate increased to 80 percent from 79 percent last year. The rise in institutional deliveries has contributed to lessening the maternal mortality rate, which is 151 in every 100,000 live births.“Fifty percent of the neonates die in the first 24 hours of birth,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services. “Most of our health facilities, including birthing centres, lack proper infrastructures.”Study shows that 85 percent of all deaths among children under the age of five in Nepal take place before a child’s first birthday, with 64 percent occurring during the first month of life.Along with trained human resources, infrastructures and quality services, deaths of neonates are also linked to the antenatal care visit of pregnant women, access to health facilities, timely referral system and others, experts say. The government has been taking various measures to reduce neonatal deaths, including planning to set up a ‘special newborn care unit’ in all district hospitals throughout the country. For that, concerned agencies under the health ministry have imparted training to all doctors, nurses and paramedics serving in Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok and Makawanpur district hospitals.Special newborn care units are general units designed to care for newborn children who fall ill shortly after birth. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics monitor ailing children admitted to the unit.The health ministry has installed an underfloor heating system at birthing centres in four mountain districts to curb postpartum and neonatal deaths there.Underfloor heating is a form of central heating that ensures indoor climate control for thermal comfort. It uses an electrical heating cable installed underneath the flooring.Hypothermia, infection, low birth weight, premature birth, and abnormal birth asphyxia are among the leading causes of neonatal deaths, doctors say.Some of the programmes being undertaken to lower child mortality include newborn care, kangaroo care, exclusive breastfeeding, infection prevention, chlorhexidine for umbilical cord care, and free neonatal care. “Whatever the achievements we made so far were achieved by the measures taken as of now,” said Upreti. “The ongoing programme may not achieve further progress. Government must implement the programmes and plans to prevent more deaths.” ","summary":"The 16th five-year periodic plan, proposed by the National Planning Commission, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from the existing 21 in every 1,000 live births.

According to officials at the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control, the public need not panic as the problematic batches of these products have been pulled from the market and their import stopped. Yet anecdotal evidence suggests that most stores never stopped selling these spice brands. Another of the department’s laughable excuses for its failure to examine the collected spice samples is that it lacks necessary chemicals to test for traces of ethylene oxide, which is directly linked to multiple forms of cancer. It was because of the reported presence of this chemical in the products of the two brands—as discovered in food labs in Singapore and Hong Kong—that they had to be banned in Nepal. Because of poor demand following the ban, importers say, very little of these spices is entering Nepal. Yet, here again, there is no evidence to prove that claim. This episode of tainted spices raises some troubling questions. If the country does not have basic chemicals to test for such dangerous substances in food products, how can we be sure that similar products from domestic manufacturers are not poisonous? It’s common knowledge that most tests on food products available in Nepali markets are carried out during the festive time of Dashain and Tihar. Otherwise, at other times, we seldom hear of such tests. This suggests that even the few tests undertaken are for show, and there is no long-term state commitment to ensuring public health. Many urban centres of Nepal are now witnessing dangerous levels of air pollution. Water is scarce in much of the country. Most of the food we consume, from pesticide-laden fruits and vegetables to carcinogen-containing spices, will only worsen our health. Even in general, those with lesser means suffer more adverse health outcomes. Health and food products from around the world are now readily available in our supermarkets. Those with the means can access the more expensive and safer food products while the rest have to rely on the cheapest and often the most tainted food products. Couple this with the ever-increasing healthcare costs in Nepal, and you get a stark difference in the health outcomes between the rich and the poor. One American study found that the greater one’s income, the lower one’s likelihood of disease and premature death, and “Americans at all income levels are less healthy than those with incomes higher than their own.” Another study showed that low income is associated with a poor quality dietary intake. Similar dynamics have been observed wherever such studies have been carried out. A country that cannot ensure a minimum level of standard on the food the masses rely on cannot be called an equitable state. Food security is not just about ensuring people have enough to eat, it is as much about making sure what they eat is safe.    ","summary":"In a breathtaking display of callousness to public health, two weeks into a ban on Indian spice brands Everest and MDH, their products continue to be available in the market, including on various online stores.

Food security is not just about ensuring people have enough to eat, it is as much about making sure what they eat is safe.    "},{"hash":"8712412ff281c8cb4a19ad5f047eb391384f89801948ed87cf0aa14758047f93","title":"taming-of-the-shrews","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/06/02/taming-of-the-shrews","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/LeadPostFile-1717336412.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1717286400000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"The collective indignity bestowed on political women, from Shailaja Acharya to Sumana Shrestha, by political patriarchs needs immediate redress.

Sahana’s grit, Shailaja’s impatience, Binda’s blatant feminism and Sumana’s formidability seem to have threatened those with the traditional bent of mind. At least two generations of strong, opinionated women have been sidelined or ousted because they did not fit into the mould of patriarchal party politics. It almost seems like the traditional men view them as political “shrews” who, like in the famous Shakespearean play The Taming of the Shrew, need to be “tamed”, cut to a size that is desirable to political patriarchy.Until not long ago, the concept of a “good woman” stemmed from feminine subservience and obedience. Women’s personhood was stunted through intense psychological conditioning that can be traced back to the origins of the state and society. A woman was told how her family’s honour rested on her good character. She was introduced to a heavy burden of feminine morality at an early age. With stories being fed about good women versus bad, patriarchy was very successful in grooming girls to grow up to be good women and obedient keepers of their family’s honour. Subservience was the prerequisite to being a good woman. A good woman was anything but defiant, and if by chance she did get tempted to disobey and defy the norms, she paid a hefty price. This “truth” was continuously fed into the feminine psyche, mostly through religious texts and scriptures. These women were duly punished in the ancient scriptures and medieval texts crafted and propagated by men.Vyaas wrote the story of how Draupadi was dragged by her hair and abused publicly because she had made fun of Duryodhana, leading to the great war between the Pandava and Kaurava brothers. Mother Mary was glorified as a virgin, while Mary Magdalene was vilified as a “loose” woman and had to be rescued. Sita’s disobedience tempted Ravana and caused much grief to Lord Ram. Eve disobeyed the Lord and ate the apple only to be the cause of Adam’s banishment. Khadija was a strong woman and a successful merchant before she married the Prophet, but she submitted herself to him and became his first disciple. In addition, the annual celebration of Swasthani Vrata Katha revered the ideal woman in the form of Goma Brahmani, who never protested, tolerated every injustice inflicted against her personhood. The idea of feminine morality has been strongly correlated with women’s socio-cultural subservience, religious conformity, psychological and economic fragility and physical docility. Even in politics, the men in charge prefer women who embody traditional femininity. However, here lies the problem: The idea of moral, subservient women clashes with the essence of equality and freedom propounded by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Women who have learned the freedoms cannot unlearn them. Today, several women in politics are highly qualified, independent, articulate and honest. They live the most painful existence because the unlearning of patriarchal values has already taken place within them, and they have a fully developed sense of personhood, which, however, is repeatedly obliterated by their party men or other political men who still operate by the patriarchal rules. Strong, independent, ethical women are repeatedly denied space in the party’s leadership. Educated, dignified, honest, resolute, independent and opinionated, Shailja Acharya was often ridiculed for her “short temper” and “moods”. In UML’s case, Sahana’s leadership in the inter-party women’s caucus irked her party men. An economist by training, she was more qualified than most men in her party, but her commitment to the larger political sorority was perceived as defiance; therefore, a covert “cutting to size” was practised against her as well. Narratives are created to invalidate women as viable leaders. These days, the “tamings” have become more overt. Binda Pandey, one of the handful of qualified women inside UML, was denied an election ticket, and the insider quickly pointed out that her “attitude” killed her prospects.

The latest “taming” attempt, however, appears much more menacing than the past. A woman with an ivy-league education, who speaks the global language, wears gender-neutral clothing, questions the old guards about procedural gaps, carries her own bags, drives her own car and has managed to keep herself out of the clout-centric politics so far, must irk the political retainers quite intensely to receive such blatant, overt attacks regarding her personal choices: From her clothing to her life partner.

One emerges as a powerhouse, while the other struggles to meet domestic demand and control the circulation of substandard medicine. Nepal’s pharmaceutical landscape reveals multifaceted challenges, ranging from regulatory hurdles and infrastructure deficiencies to limited research and development capabilities. In contrast, Bangladesh’s success story is underpinned by strategic initiatives, innovative policies and a resilient entrepreneurial spirit. This disparity begs the question: What lessons can Nepal learn from Bangladesh?Bangladesh’s approachesAs a least developed country (LDC), Nepal benefits from exemptions under international agreements, particularly intellectual property rights. These include dismissal from many Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) standards until July 1, 2034, and from providing pharmaceutical patents until January 1, 2033. Despite these advantages, Nepal has not fully leveraged these provisions. Meanwhile, Bangladesh, another LDC, has capitalised on TRIPS flexibilities, abolishing product patent protection in 2008. This strategic move has fostered a thriving pharmaceutical sector, producing affordable generics and exporting to over 150 countries. According to the Bangladesh Pharma Market and Regulatory Report, Bangladesh is not only self-reliant on generic drugs, serving 97 percent of the domestic market and exporting to more than 150 countries, but also produces complex anti-cancer drugs, hepatitis-C vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, biotech products and hormones.Nepal’s scenarioIn the pharmaceutical sector, success means either producing intermediate products such as active pharmaceutical ingredients like raw materials, producing generic medicine at competitive prices, or adding value to complex medicines with technology. Unfortunately, Nepal fails to achieve any of these—a heavy reliance on imports and a struggling domestic industry plague Nepal. One case lists 126 pharmaceutical manufacturers, the majority producing generic drugs necessitating imports of other types of medications to Nepal. The Nepali pharmaceutical market is valued at Rs53 billion, with imports accounting for 54.5 percent of the total market share. In another case, Nepal’s southern neighbour, India, is a dominant pharmaceutical player (especially generic drugs). It exports drugs to over 200 countries and captures a significant global market share. India's technological advancement in this sector inherently enables the production of more cost-effective alternatives, posing a formidable challenge for Nepal's domestic industries to compete. To foster self-reliance, the Nepal Government imposed an import ban on 37 generic medicines produced by its domestic companies.While protectionist measures such as banning competition may offer short-term benefits to interest groups, there are concerning long-term implications for consumer welfare. The cost of health for the general public has now increased. As consumers, we bear the burden of higher prices for incompetent products. With lesser competition, there are now abundant substandard drugs in the market. We are compelled to consume the paracetamol produced by companies such as Nepal Drugs Limited, which was banned for not complying with the WHO standards. Additionally, sodium chloride and ringer lactate solution for injection, manufactured by a leading pharmaceutical company in Nepal, Lomus Parentals and Formulation Pvt Ltd., was found to be substandard in laboratory tests. These are just some of the many troubling reports.Furthermore, the pharmaceutical industry in Nepal faces a significant challenge due to the lack of standardisation. The presence of numerous unregistered drugs exacerbates this vulnerability, amplified by Nepal's proximity to India, a hub for pharmaceutical production with 35 percent of the market share in counterfeit drugs. Despite efforts to regulate the industry, the current workforce of 38 drug inspectors is insufficient to adequately monitor the thousands of pharmacies and the medicines they distribute. This strain on resources intensifies the challenges of ensuring pharmaceutical quality and safety in Nepal. Therefore, instead of investing significantly in loss-bearing state-owned Nepal Drugs Limited, the government should allocate its infrastructure and resources to monitoring the quality of medicines.In Nepal, 100 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are sourced, majority of them from India and the rest from China. While Nepal is yet to fully leverage the TRIPS provisions, Bangladesh recognised that fully leveraging its status as an LDC member necessitated the production of patented APIs at a reduced cost. Today, Bangladesh offers VAT waivers and VAT deduction at source on purchase and sales of locally made APIs, laboratory reagents, all raw materials, immovable assets and services up to 2032. Unlike Nepal's five-year term loans for factories and equipment, Bangladesh provides a 12-year tenure, facilitating long-term investments. Moreover, Bangladesh allows for export earning retention of 40 percent, encouraging companies to focus on research and development to boost exports. It also imposes no single borrower cap and offers back-to-back letters of credit facilities. But Nepal has limitations on borrowing. Information gapAnother challenge in Nepal's pharmaceutical industry is the gap in information. Consider this: When illness strikes, whom do we turn to? Typically, it's the expertise of a trusted medical professional. Do we question their prescriptions or the associated costs? Rarely. This lack of scrutiny renders the price of medicine largely inflexible. How about our knowledge of available options? Do we actively seek alternatives or simply go with what's prescribed? More often than not, doctors are the main decision-makers in this arena.Pharmaceutical companies navigate this by relying heavily on marketing representatives to engage doctors. In Nepal, all drugs are generic, and their formulas have been available in the public domain for a long time. So, the only way for manufacturers to stand out is through aggressive marketing tactics, often offering lucrative incentives for doctors to prescribe specific brands.Policy questionThis brings us to a crucial policy question: How can the government redirect its focus to fostering innovation within the industry instead of incentivising doctors? To tackle this issue, some countries around the globe have implemented legislation mandating the prescription of medicine by their generic names. Bangladesh has taken a different approach to resolving this. A 20 percent cash incentive is provided if producers add at least 20 percent value to the API. This has incentivised the local API producers to innovate the health industry rather than sustain in the market by providing lucrative Public Relations packages to the doctors or by producing substandard products at a lower cost. Like in the case of Bangladesh, enhancing competitiveness through a free-market approach could offer a sustainable solution to address the vulnerabilities of the Nepali pharmaceutical industry. Finally, for any industry to progress, embracing technological advancement along with investment is imperative. One potential avenue for this advancement lies in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). However, securing FDI, particularly in this sector, is complicated, as the research and development spending of the pharmaceutical industry is 8.1 times higher than that of the aerospace industry, 7.2 times that of the chemical industry, and 1.2 times that of the computer services industry. Therefore, improving the overall business environment and ease of doing business index of Nepal is imperative to attract FDI. It is essential to embrace the power of the free market to heal Nepal’s pharmaceutical industry. Bangladesh's success story shows how competition can drive innovation and affordability. Sometimes, abolishing patents leads to the spread of information, followed by innovation. By leveraging TRIPS flexibilities, Nepal can enable local companies to produce affordable generics and pioneer new treatments that address the unique healthcare needs of Nepali citizens.

The longest conflict of the 21st century has erupted into a full-fledged war, this time with Hamas at the forefront, fighting for Palestinian statehood. While Israel maintains military dominance over the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, recent events have shattered its image of having an unbreachable defense and a powerful, moral military. In this piece, we will examine the events that have unfolded since the armed incursion and their implications.Following the Palestinian “intifadas” (uprisings) in 1987 and 2000 against Israeli occupation, Palestinians have continued their struggle through various means, including protests, boycotts, arts and theatres. Though these intifadas led to the signing of the Oslo Accords and Israeli disengagement from Gaza, respectively, they have not yielded significant results. Soon after, despite being considered a terrorist organisation by countries like the United States, Hamas secured a victory over the ruling party, Fatah, in the second Palestinian Legislative Election held in 2006. The rise of Hamas, driven by anti-Zionist and anti-imperialist ideologies, led to several Israeli raids in Gaza and the West Bank, resulting in the capture of senior leaders and the imposition of sanctions.Fast forward to October 7, 2023, Hamas carried out an armed incursion (Operation Al-Aqsa Flood) from the Gaza Strip into Southern Israel and took Israeli hostages as leverage for the diplomatic efforts. While this event tarnished Israel's image of an unbreachable defense, the consequences of the event thereafter have proved fatal for the Palestinians. The Israeli military ordered an evacuation of 1.1 million Gazans living in the north of Gaza within 24 hours on October 13, which the Palestinians describe today as the “second Nakba (displacement)”. Armed by the US and its allies, Israel started its ground invasion in Gaza on October 27, followed by the indiscriminate bombing of hospitals and civilian infrastructure on account of eliminating Hamas. However, the extreme measures taken by the Israeli government led by Netanyahu have proved catastrophic in a geopolitical context and are far from achieving its goal of eradicating Hamas. Moreover, the adventure has become an uphill battle for the Israelis and their allies.Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, led by Hamas, though it reached the brink of instigating a full-blown regional conflict, diplomatic efforts have prevailed in avoiding this nightmare. However, Houthis in Yemen have joined the force of resistance by blocking the passage of the Red Sea for Israeli ships and its allies. The initiative of the US to hold Yemen responsible for its action, which involved the bombing of Yemeni military facilities along with the UK and the formation of a multinational force to protect trade in the Red Sea, has failed. Additionally, the possibility of Hezbollah—a Lebanese political and military group led by Hassan Nasrallah, which has been very vocal in its support for the ongoing resistance by Hamas—joining the conflict full-fledged still lingers as Israel and Hezbollah continue to engage in frequent skirmishes on parts of Israel-Lebanon border, occupied Golan Heights and Syria. However, this would be a big blow to Netanyahu’s government, as Hezbollah is a far superior military group than Hamas. Losing support at home and flexing its military prowess, Netanyahu’s government struck the Iranian Embassy Complex in Syria, killing 16 people, including eight members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in April. Moreover, one can also interpret this attack as an Israeli frustration against the Iranian-backed resistance groups in the region (including Hamas, Hezbollah and other proxies) and an attempt to drag the US into a confrontation. This attack, condemned by numerous countries, proved fatal to the Israelis as Iran retaliated with missile and drone strikes on some of the Israeli military bases within its territory. The response by the Iranians to the unprecedented attack on its embassy sent a clear message to both the United States and the Israelis about its military arsenal and its readiness to retaliate against any escalation. This event not only exposed a gaping hole in Israel's defense but also etched Iran as a formidable power in the region. Furthermore, the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict has left inedible repercussions on Israel's standing in the global community. The harrowing images and videos coming out of the Gaza Strip have left the international governing body speechless and have led people to reason for Israel as a genocidal state. Since the start of the conflict, the Palestinian death toll has exceeded 35,000, with 80,000 more injured. The repercussions of these events are sure to leave an indelible mark on Israel's image, as the International Criminal Court has sought legal action by issuing an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defence Minister Gallant. In a diplomatic fallout, Bolivia has severed all diplomatic ties with Israel, while Chile, Colombia, Jordan, Bahrain, Honduras, Turkey, Chad, South Africa and Belize have recalled their ambassadors. Additionally, pro-Palestinian protests across US campuses, which later spread to Europe and other regions, have dealt a significant blow to Israel, both from the public relations and diplomatic perspective. To add to that, talks on a two-state solution have gained much more momentum in the international community, and recently, Norway, Ireland and Spain have announced their willingness to recognise Palestine. However, the growing isolation of Israel in the international community has had little to no effect on its approach to the ongoing conflict. Days after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling to stop the Rafah offensive, Israel conducted an air strike, which left hundreds of civilians dead, including children. The silence of Western countries at a time when humanity is at stake is both tragic and horrifying. In contrast, to show strong support for the Israeli government, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Mike Johnson recently invited Netanyahu to speak in the US Congress. It is likely to undermine US diplomacy and its credibility as a peacekeeper across the globe in the future as it facilitates Israel's conduct of a war that’s been argued to be a “genocide”.

Soon after, despite being considered a terrorist organisation by countries like the United States, Hamas secured a victory over the ruling party, Fatah, in the second Palestinian Legislative Election held in 2006. The rise of Hamas, driven by anti-Zionist and anti-imperialist ideologies, led to several Israeli raids in Gaza and the West Bank, resulting in the capture of senior leaders and the imposition of sanctions.Fast forward to October 7, 2023, Hamas carried out an armed incursion (Operation Al-Aqsa Flood) from the Gaza Strip into Southern Israel and took Israeli hostages as leverage for the diplomatic efforts. While this event tarnished Israel's image of an unbreachable defense, the consequences of the event thereafter have proved fatal for the Palestinians. The Israeli military ordered an evacuation of 1.1 million Gazans living in the north of Gaza within 24 hours on October 13, which the Palestinians describe today as the “second Nakba (displacement)”. Armed by the US and its allies, Israel started its ground invasion in Gaza on October 27, followed by the indiscriminate bombing of hospitals and civilian infrastructure on account of eliminating Hamas. However, the extreme measures taken by the Israeli government led by Netanyahu have proved catastrophic in a geopolitical context and are far from achieving its goal of eradicating Hamas. Moreover, the adventure has become an uphill battle for the Israelis and their allies.Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, led by Hamas, though it reached the brink of instigating a full-blown regional conflict, diplomatic efforts have prevailed in avoiding this nightmare. However, Houthis in Yemen have joined the force of resistance by blocking the passage of the Red Sea for Israeli ships and its allies. The initiative of the US to hold Yemen responsible for its action, which involved the bombing of Yemeni military facilities along with the UK and the formation of a multinational force to protect trade in the Red Sea, has failed. Additionally, the possibility of Hezbollah—a Lebanese political and military group led by Hassan Nasrallah, which has been very vocal in its support for the ongoing resistance by Hamas—joining the conflict full-fledged still lingers as Israel and Hezbollah continue to engage in frequent skirmishes on parts of Israel-Lebanon border, occupied Golan Heights and Syria. However, this would be a big blow to Netanyahu’s government, as Hezbollah is a far superior military group than Hamas. Losing support at home and flexing its military prowess, Netanyahu’s government struck the Iranian Embassy Complex in Syria, killing 16 people, including eight members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in April. Moreover, one can also interpret this attack as an Israeli frustration against the Iranian-backed resistance groups in the region (including Hamas, Hezbollah and other proxies) and an attempt to drag the US into a confrontation. This attack, condemned by numerous countries, proved fatal to the Israelis as Iran retaliated with missile and drone strikes on some of the Israeli military bases within its territory. The response by the Iranians to the unprecedented attack on its embassy sent a clear message to both the United States and the Israelis about its military arsenal and its readiness to retaliate against any escalation. This event not only exposed a gaping hole in Israel's defense but also etched Iran as a formidable power in the region. Furthermore, the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict has left inedible repercussions on Israel's standing in the global community. The harrowing images and videos coming out of the Gaza Strip have left the international governing body speechless and have led people to reason for Israel as a genocidal state. Since the start of the conflict, the Palestinian death toll has exceeded 35,000, with 80,000 more injured. The repercussions of these events are sure to leave an indelible mark on Israel's image, as the International Criminal Court has sought legal action by issuing an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defence Minister Gallant. In a diplomatic fallout, Bolivia has severed all diplomatic ties with Israel, while Chile, Colombia, Jordan, Bahrain, Honduras, Turkey, Chad, South Africa and Belize have recalled their ambassadors. Additionally, pro-Palestinian protests across US campuses, which later spread to Europe and other regions, have dealt a significant blow to Israel, both from the public relations and diplomatic perspective. To add to that, talks on a two-state solution have gained much more momentum in the international community, and recently, Norway, Ireland and Spain have announced their willingness to recognise Palestine. However, the growing isolation of Israel in the international community has had little to no effect on its approach to the ongoing conflict. Days after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling to stop the Rafah offensive, Israel conducted an air strike, which left hundreds of civilians dead, including children. The silence of Western countries at a time when humanity is at stake is both tragic and horrifying. In contrast, to show strong support for the Israeli government, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Mike Johnson recently invited Netanyahu to speak in the US Congress. It is likely to undermine US diplomacy and its credibility as a peacekeeper across the globe in the future as it facilitates Israel's conduct of a war that’s been argued to be a “genocide”.

That is set to be the highest vote tally percentage in Mexico’s democratic history.The ruling coalition was also on track for a possible two-thirds supermajority in both houses of Congress which would allow the coalition to pass constitutional reforms without opposition support, according to the range of results given by the electoral authority.Opposition candidate Xochitl Galvez took between 26.6% and 28.6% of the vote, preliminary results showed, and Sheinbaum said Galvez had called her to concede.“For the first time in the 200 years of the republic I will become the first woman president of Mexico,” Sheinbaum told supporters to loud cheers of “president, president.”Victory for Sheinbaum is a major step for Mexico, a country known for its macho culture and home to the world's second-biggest Roman Catholic population, which for years pushed more traditional values and roles for women.Sheinbaum is the first woman to win a general election in the United States, Mexico or Canada.“I never imagined that one day I would vote for a woman,” said 87-year-old Edelmira Montiel, a Sheinbaum supporter in Mexico's smallest state Tlaxcala.“Before we couldn’t even vote, and when you could, it was to vote for the person your husband told you to vote for. Thank God that has changed and I get to live it,” Montiel added.Sheinbaum has a complicated path ahead. She must balance promises to increase popular welfare policies while inheriting a hefty budget deficit and low economic growth.After preliminary results were announced, she told supporters her government would be fiscally responsible and respect the autonomy of the central bank.She has vowed to improve security but has given few details and the election, the most violent in Mexico’s modern history with 38 candidates murdered, has reinforced massive security problems. Many analysts say organised crime groups expanded and deepened their influence during Lopez Obrador's term.Sunday’s vote was also marred by the killing of two people at polling stations in Puebla state. More people have been killed - over 185,000 - during the mandate of Lopez Obrador than during any other administration in Mexico’s modern history, although the homicide rate has been inching down.“Unless she commits to making a game-changing level of investment in improving policing and reducing impunity, Sheinbaum will likely struggle to achieve a significant improvement in overall levels of security,” said Nathaniel Parish Flannery, an independent Latin America political risk analyst.The ruling MORENA party has also declared its candidate the winner of the Mexico City mayorship race, one of the country’s most important posts, though the opposition has disputed that and claims its own nominee won the contest.US RELATIONSAmong the new president's challenges will be tense negotiations with the United States over the huge flows of US-bound migrants crossing Mexico and security cooperation over drug trafficking at a time when the US fentanyl epidemic rages.Mexican officials expect these negotiations to be more difficult if the US presidency is won by Donald Trump in November. Trump has vowed to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese cars made in Mexico and said he would mobilise special forces to fight the cartels.At home, the next president will be tasked with addressing electricity and water shortages and luring manufacturers to relocate as part of the nearshoring trend, in which companies move supply chains closer to their main markets.Sheinbaum will also have to wrestle with what to do with Pemex, the state oil giant that has seen production decline for two decades and is drowning in debt.“It cannot just be that there is an endless pit where you put public money in and the company is never profitable,” said Alberto Ramos, chief Latin America economist at Goldman Sachs. “They have to rethink the business model of Pemex.”Lopez Obrador doubled the minimum wage, reduced poverty and oversaw a strengthening peso and low levels of unemployment - successes that made him incredibly popular.Sheinbaum has promised to expand welfare programs, but it will not be easy with Mexico on track for a large deficit this year and sluggish GDP growth of just 1.5% expected by the central bank in 2025.Lopez Obrador has loomed over the campaign, seeking to turn the vote into a referendum on his political agenda. Sheinbaum has rejected opposition claims that she would be a “puppet” of Lopez Obrador, though she has pledged to continue many of his policies including those that have helped Mexico’s poorest.In her victory speech, Sheinbaum thanked Lopez Obrador as “a unique person who has transformed our country for the better.”But political analyst Viri Rios said she thought sexism was behind criticism that Sheinbaum was going to be a puppet of the outgoing leader.“It’s unbelievable that people cannot believe she’s going to be making her own decisions, and I think that’s got a lot to do with the fact that she’s female,” she said.

The uncanny political developments in the country have propelled the speed of these events. Little worried by the indications of the erosion of the hard-earned democratic values and practices seen in political coalitions and the assault on media freedom, I briefly review the history of political leaders' dreams and failures in this column. I want to show that we, the people, bear the brunt of history’s tragic and farcical turns. An important shift has occurred in Nepali history from the tragic to the ludicrous. Karl Marx, in his famous work The Eighteenth Brumaire Of Louis Bonaparte, said, \"All the great events and characters of history occur twice, firstly as tragedy, secondly as farce.\" No communist leaders of Nepal appear to have referred to this book and Marx's prophetic statement except Baburam Bhattarai, the erstwhile Maoist leader and comrade of the current Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has recently got the vote of confidence for the fourth time in 17 months. This is an interesting episode of political farce. Political parties and the cronies who are always proactive are reducing the democratic system established by people's sacrifice and dedication to a farce. That becomes clear if we watch the drama that happens in Parliament.There is a serious part to this historical shift. Marx also says, \"The social revolution of the nineteenth century cannot create its poetry from the past but only from the future”. This means that to draw strength and meaning from the past, you should create its poetry from the future. This is a little academic point. Repetition of historyThe Nepali democracy and those who have been given the responsibility to protect and use it precisely lack that vision of futurity; they do not perceive the poetry of the future. Their actions in parliament, narrow partisan behaviours, the reckless language they use, inadequate knowledge about the political dynamics of social change and the important time they squander away by acting irresponsibly all show that they lack the vision to create poetry from the future. I have begun to wonder whether the Nepali political parties will fully utilise the democratic political system to ameliorate the condition of the people of this land.The Nepali media fraternity says the sudden arrest of Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya on May 21, 2024, is unfair and \"motivated by personal vendetta.\" The agency in question is the coalition government led by Dahal and the Home Ministry. A certain revelation occurred to me after watching an interview with Bhattarai on Kantipur television on the same night. Bhattarai recalled one article he published in Kantipur in August 2001 about the royal massacre. I was mourning my mother's death in my village, Sabala of Terathum. I read that article to my elder brother and Nepali Congress district leader, Laya Prasad Subedi, who totally agreed with Bhattarai's analysis. The underground Maoist leader Bhattarai has said in that article the murders were the result of a \"political conspiracy\". Kailash Sirohiya and his co-publisher, Binod Raj Gyawali, and the editor-in-chief of Kantipur, Yubaraj Ghimire, were arrested for publishing that. Bhattarai said in the interview that he was stunned by the drama of Sirohiya's arrest, which shows an uncanny repetition of history. This time, he said, “Prachanda is in the position of the king, and the same media person is arrested, as the common opinion says, for publishing news stories about Prachanda's government.” Bhattarai also revealed that in a prime ministerial system like ours, no such decision is taken without the prime minister's consent. It is not the minister but the prime minister who can make such decisions, he explained.Whatever the position of parties and the leaders at the current moment of history, those who have followed the political history know that Bhattarai has always made decisions according to his understanding, conscience and interpretation of history. Bhattarai had declared that he was leaving the Maoist party because, metaphorically, it was not safe to live in the red-labelled house, which was a category of the badly damaged buildings after the earthquakes of 2015. I am dismayed by the performances of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. I am getting more and more disillusioned by his actions and those of the other communist leaders of different groups who are all in the coalition now. They include communist stalwarts like Dahal, KP Sharma Oli and Madhav Kumar Nepal. There is no point in talking about the behaviour of the individual ministers, whose sense of history and the missions often don't come to the fore. The coalition’s leader and a major actor Dahal is at the centre of the decisions in this system if we believe the interpretation of the former prime minister Bhattarai.It is challenging for all political leaders to maintain a history of their choice and to live up to the expectations of the people. Dahal is no exception. I want to recall one event here. Dahal had attended the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi in the third week of November 2006. Some people told me about him when I attended a literary conference in Delhi after that event. One professor, impressed with Dahal’s metamorphosis, gave me the news published in the paper. It cites Dahal saying, \"I have lived my life in jungle, now I will lead my life in light.\" Another report said, ''Nepal's firebrand Maoist leader Prachanda on Saturday said the political battle in the 21st century will be fought over democracy, which at present is in deep crisis.\" A euphoric Dahal, by his transformation, said while addressing the second session on the second day of the fourth Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi, \"Democracy will rule the world\". The report also said, \"The former Indian prime minister and admirer of Prachanda I. K. Gujaral says he had read about many epic stories about revolution and Prachanda has shown it by accomplishing an epic battle in Nepal.\"History says Dahal and other leaders have clearly failed to deliver. His and his various coalitions’ actions show that staying in power is their only goal. What has begun to worry nonpartisan academics and writers like us is that the power coalitions and groups only work with what Bertrand Russell calls the “lust for power.” The time has come for the free media, legal activists and civil society to be vigilant about protecting democracy.  ","summary":"These days, I watch Nepali television news more frequently and read broadsheet papers and online news to observe the clash of dreams and reality, particularly in political events.

Their actions in parliament, narrow partisan behaviours, the reckless language they use, inadequate knowledge about the political dynamics of social change and the important time they squander away by acting irresponsibly all show that they lack the vision to create poetry from the future. I have begun to wonder whether the Nepali political parties will fully utilise the democratic political system to ameliorate the condition of the people of this land.The Nepali media fraternity says the sudden arrest of Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya on May 21, 2024, is unfair and \"motivated by personal vendetta.\" The agency in question is the coalition government led by Dahal and the Home Ministry. A certain revelation occurred to me after watching an interview with Bhattarai on Kantipur television on the same night. Bhattarai recalled one article he published in Kantipur in August 2001 about the royal massacre. I was mourning my mother's death in my village, Sabala of Terathum. I read that article to my elder brother and Nepali Congress district leader, Laya Prasad Subedi, who totally agreed with Bhattarai's analysis. The underground Maoist leader Bhattarai has said in that article the murders were the result of a \"political conspiracy\". Kailash Sirohiya and his co-publisher, Binod Raj Gyawali, and the editor-in-chief of Kantipur, Yubaraj Ghimire, were arrested for publishing that. Bhattarai said in the interview that he was stunned by the drama of Sirohiya's arrest, which shows an uncanny repetition of history. This time, he said, “Prachanda is in the position of the king, and the same media person is arrested, as the common opinion says, for publishing news stories about Prachanda's government.” Bhattarai also revealed that in a prime ministerial system like ours, no such decision is taken without the prime minister's consent. It is not the minister but the prime minister who can make such decisions, he explained.Whatever the position of parties and the leaders at the current moment of history, those who have followed the political history know that Bhattarai has always made decisions according to his understanding, conscience and interpretation of history. Bhattarai had declared that he was leaving the Maoist party because, metaphorically, it was not safe to live in the red-labelled house, which was a category of the badly damaged buildings after the earthquakes of 2015. I am dismayed by the performances of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. I am getting more and more disillusioned by his actions and those of the other communist leaders of different groups who are all in the coalition now. They include communist stalwarts like Dahal, KP Sharma Oli and Madhav Kumar Nepal. There is no point in talking about the behaviour of the individual ministers, whose sense of history and the missions often don't come to the fore. The coalition’s leader and a major actor Dahal is at the centre of the decisions in this system if we believe the interpretation of the former prime minister Bhattarai.It is challenging for all political leaders to maintain a history of their choice and to live up to the expectations of the people. Dahal is no exception. I want to recall one event here. Dahal had attended the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi in the third week of November 2006. Some people told me about him when I attended a literary conference in Delhi after that event. One professor, impressed with Dahal’s metamorphosis, gave me the news published in the paper. It cites Dahal saying, \"I have lived my life in jungle, now I will lead my life in light.\" Another report said, ''Nepal's firebrand Maoist leader Prachanda on Saturday said the political battle in the 21st century will be fought over democracy, which at present is in deep crisis.\" A euphoric Dahal, by his transformation, said while addressing the second session on the second day of the fourth Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi, \"Democracy will rule the world\". The report also said, \"The former Indian prime minister and admirer of Prachanda I. K. Gujaral says he had read about many epic stories about revolution and Prachanda has shown it by accomplishing an epic battle in Nepal.\"History says Dahal and other leaders have clearly failed to deliver. His and his various coalitions’ actions show that staying in power is their only goal. What has begun to worry nonpartisan academics and writers like us is that the power coalitions and groups only work with what Bertrand Russell calls the “lust for power.” The time has come for the free media, legal activists and civil society to be vigilant about protecting democracy.  "},{"hash":"8eb05a817cd87b756443cf10118035403026e91c36201dbd8003a0722c8f8e88","title":"speakers-are-supposed-to-be-neutral-not-all-succeed-in-the-role","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/05/19/speakers-are-supposed-to-be-neutral-not-all-succeed-in-the-role","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/Untitled2-1716084227.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1716076800000,"source":"kp","category":"national","content":"The Speaker of the House of Representatives is expected to run parliamentary proceedings impartially following democratic norms.

Congress, the main opposition party, has been disrupting the House proceedings, demanding a parliamentary inquiry against Lamichhane in his alleged connections with cooperative funds embezzlement. \"It is unacceptable to us that only the Congress speaks in the meeting.

Then the situation turned tense and resulted in a scuffle.Though Congress allowed President Ramchandra Paudel to present the government’s policies and programmes on May 14, it obstructed the motion to thank the head of state for the task, as per the parliamentary tradition.After the May 16 incident, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa criticised Speaker Ghimire for his role in Parliament. “Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened in the House is unfortunate, and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.” However, former Speaker Taranath Ranabhat, also a former general secretary of the Congress, does not agree with Thapa. Speakers should not be held squarely responsible for their role in Parliament, said Ranabhat.“Parliamentarians represent their parties, but the Speaker's role is like a referee,” Ranabhat told the Post. “When trying to bring everyone together, sometimes the Speaker might try to favour some parties to win their confidence which might be uncomfortable for others. However, the Speaker's role should not be questioned on that basis alone.”Earlier, the roles played by former Speakers Agni Prasad Sapkota and Krishna Bahadur Mahara—both from the Maoist Centre—became controversial too. Then-finance minister Janardan Sharma, a Maoist Centre leader, tabled the substitution bill related to budget ordinances in Parliament in September 2021, amid protests of the main opposition UML.

According to the latest data released by the Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal, deposits in banks and financial institutions (BFIs) have crossed the Rs6.16 trillion mark, while credit disbursement is Rs5.12 trillion. These two figures are 108 and 92 percent of Nepal's estimated Rs5.7 trillion gross domestic product (GDP), respectively. This means that even after maintaining mandatory cash ratios with the central bank—which amounts to around Rs3.6 trillion in aggregate—about Rs6.5 trillion is available as loanable liquidity in the banking system. This, indeed, should have been a god-sent historical opportunity to catapult Nepal to the next level of economic activities and growth. Sadly, that does not seem to be on the anvil.Now, the loan uptake by the entrepreneurs and investors is very slow. The credit growth is 2 percent slower than the deposit growth. The effective interest rate is still in double digits, hovering between 10 to 12 percent. For small borrowers who generally rely on microfinance institutions and credit cooperatives, the cost of funds is at least 20 percent. High interest rate is apparently one of the key deterrents to potential borrowers. Also, a higher amount of deposit collection compared to loan disbursement is taking a toll on the profitability of the BFIs.On one hand, despite most BFIs’ favourable loanable liquidity position, they are unwilling to cut the interest rate for fear of a further decline in profitability. Such practices blatantly compromise the principle of price determination in a free and complete market based on the quantity of funds demanded and supplied. On the other hand, non-performing loans (NPL) of the BFIs are rapidly growing. The total NPL was 3.6 percent of the total loan disbursement last January, which has now risen to 4.8 percent. In nominal terms, approximately Rs250 billion worth of loans is slipping into the risky zone. As its obvious aftermath, the number of borrowers blacklisted for their default on timely repayment is reported to be about 200 per day. This inescapable trap to businesses is created due to the growing number of business closures and increasing financial losses in those businesses struggling to survive. Economy in recessionTechnically, a recession is defined as a decline in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters. However, to the great relief of the ruling political leaders and bureaucracy, Nepal does not produce quarterly GDP growth data. If the annual growth forecasts like the recent ones from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which predicted Nepal's growth rate to be no more than 4 percent in 2024, are to be trusted, Nepal is clearly in a recessionary trajectory. Other disappointing trends in real income, industrial output, employment rate, wholesale and retail sales and overall service sector performance confirm that the economy went downhill in several successive quarters to arrive at this stage.Other rather subjective but evident recession traits are manifested in the form of pervasive plummeting of the consumers' confidence, investors' confidence, overall market confidence, and trust deficit on the incumbent government's sincerity as the principal agent supposed to work for the economic betterment of the country.The gapsThe economic revival looks challenging even in several years if the government fails to take bold countercyclical measures, mainly in revenue collection, capital expenditure and implementing fiscal federalism. And the monetary policy must improve corporate governance in the banking sector, which private sector players dominate by more than 90 percent. This is exactly where effective coordination between fiscal and monetary policies is indispensable.On the fiscal policy side, if the tax policy to find new revenue sources is not comprehensively recalibrated, the collected revenue, like in recent years, will continue to fall short of even meeting the current expenditures, let alone augmenting the capital expenditure and saving the country from default on sovereign debt servicing. The capital allocation in the federal budget is pathetic, persistently at less than 20 percent of total earmarks. Worse, the spending capacity has effectively come down to about 40 percent of even such a low allocation.Despite federalism devolving the constitutional authority to sub-national levels to devise 'their own' public procurement laws, timely completion of contractual procedures of the projects has been extremely tardy. The complications are added by the vested interests of the people in executive power in awarding contracts with apparent conflict of interest. When the government, as the single largest procurer, fails to spend its capital budget transparently, the cash flow in the financial market is bound to shrink. This has direct ramifications on the liquidity positions of the BFIs. The persistent failure of the governments at all three tiers to carry out the capital expenditure as outlined has a cumulative adverse impact.Trust the systemA sincere effort to put fiscal federalism into practice in the true spirit of the federal polity and state architecture will certainly solve several critical issues related to fiscal resource management at the provincial or municipal levels. For instance, reasonably effective management of the bond market at the centre helps generate resources for development expenditure. In allocation, the disbursement may be proportionate to the absorption capacity of an individual administrative unit like a ministry or a federal unit like a municipality. This would ameliorate a number of pending constraints faced by the entire financial system of the country. It is already too late to consider the legislation to empower competent municipalities to issue their own development bonds so as to enhance the fiscal policy independence of the local governments and increase the stakeholder ownership of the executed projects.To conclude, two critical steps are inevitable to rescue the economy from the brink of a deeper recession. One, a stimulus package with an amalgam of fiscal and monetary incentives is necessary. The business-as-usual budget will not solve new challenges to the economy, like the rapidly depleting base of state income. Two, the impending credit risk in BFIs will be far larger if the businesses are not put back on track by enabling them to unlock their full potential, now an existential threat due to the engulfing recession.

Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled “Implementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Nepal” is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime minister’s office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the plan’s signing.“It is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,” Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.“The country’s economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,” said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the “Silkroad Roadster” in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.“When the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime minister’s trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an ‘appropriate’ time,” former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. “We also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.”The Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The document’s sub-section 12 titled ‘Other Areas’ under section 3 named ‘Cooperation Priorities’ mentions that “the two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperation”.It also says “the two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster management”.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority. In every high-level visit and meeting between Nepal and China, the initiative gets traction.Although there is no clear provision on whether the two sides should renew the agreement by exchanging correspondence, officials at the finance ministry said that would be the diplomatically correct way to go about it.There are concerns over the BRI’s stalled momentum in Nepal. The initiative’s stated focus is connectivity, trade, development strategies, and policy dialogues for cooperation in the fields of economy, environment, technology and culture.The agreement also aims to facilitate transit transport, logistics, transport network security and related infrastructure development through joint study and promote cross-border projects including railway, road, civil aviation, power grid, information and communication. The MoU also states that the two sides would conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement shortly and, if viable, start negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement to open up more markets and expand bilateral trade.Other stated areas of agreed cooperation are establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones at the existing ports, and improving the investment landscape with a view to developing mega projects in the areas of power generation, water conservation, road, railway line, cross-border transmission line, information and communication technology and infrastructure, besides customs and quarantine.Nepal also had a shaky position on the BRI in the past. After signing the deal in 2017, the government formed two committees headed by the foreign and finance secretaries to negotiate with China on the projects selected under the initiative. The finance secretary was tasked with project selection.As per the Cabinet’s mandate, the finance secretary-led committee picked 35 projects to be funded under the BRI. Then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli read out this list during his meeting with Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. Later, the Chinese side urged Kathmandu to cut the number of projects to a single digit, whereupon the list was pared down to nine projects.A former finance ministry official who was involved in several negotiations with the Chinese side said most of the nine projects were related to connectivity and infrastructure. In 2019, during the second BRI Conference in China, its outcome document listed Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network under the BRI. (Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari had attended the conference.) Then, when Chinese President Xi visited Kathmandu in October 2019, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation under the BRI.They agreed “to intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network with a view to significantly contributing to Nepal’s development agenda of graduating from a Least Developed Country,” according to a joint statement issued after Xi’s visit to Kathmandu.The Chinese side was keen to carry out the feasibility study of Kerung-Kathmandu railway under the BRI, the former finance ministry official said. “But we have shifting priorities on selecting and negotiating other projects.”The feasibility study of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway has already begun with a Chinese grant and it is expected to conclude by 2026 June, said Rohit Kumar Bisural, director general at Department of Railways.“As per our agreement, the feasibility study of the cross border railway should be completed by 2026 June. There are various studies on the ground. Nepali engineers and technical staff are not directly involved but they are supporting the Chinese technicians as required. There are no glitches. Once the study is complete, we will jointly write a report,” said Bisural.A joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that no tangible progress has been made in the past seven years in implementing the BRI plan and no agreement is likely anytime soon either.“This calls for consensus among the political parties as it is not just a matter of the government or one party,” said the joint-secretary. “The BRI is unlikely to move forward in Nepal anytime soon because there is no discussion, consultation and consensus among the major parties.”Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, former foreign minister and Nepal’s ex-ambassador to China, said many leaders and officials have blamed high-interest loans for not taking the BRI forward but that is not the reason.“We do not complete projects on time. If we did, we could easily pay back the loan and interest to China and other lending countries. Our leaders also fear the reaction of other countries [to accepting any kind of Chinese help],” said Pandey.“We have ‘fear psychosis’ while taking economic support,” he said. “Nepalis are scared that India, China or the United States will be angry if the country takes support from any one of them.” “We have to accept foreign support by taking neighbours and major powers into confidence,” Pandey said. ","summary":"Sunday marked the seventh year of the signing of the Belt and Road Initiative between Nepal and China yet the two sides are still struggling to finalise the implementation plan of the BRI that China proposed in early 2020.Nepal and China signed a memorandum of understanding on the One Belt One Road, later known as BRI, a flagship initiative of Chinese President Xi Jinping, on May 12, 2017, subject to renewal every three years.Still, there is a divergence of views on whether Nepal needs a dedicated BRI implementation plan to execute the projects under the Chinese initiative, senior government leaders and officials told the Post. Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled “Implementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Nepal” is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime minister’s office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the plan’s signing.“It is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,” Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.“The country’s economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,” said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the “Silkroad Roadster” in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.“When the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime minister’s trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an ‘appropriate’ time,” former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. “We also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.”The Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The document’s sub-section 12 titled ‘Other Areas’ under section 3 named ‘Cooperation Priorities’ mentions that “the two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperation”.It also says “the two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster management”.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority.

Released in 2023, this work offers an in-depth analysis of the profound transformations shaping our understanding of self and our role in a rapidly evolving world dominated by technological progress and ubiquitous data. In today’s world, where problems like extreme nationalism and strict populist leaders are growing, leading to harsh restrictions on media freedom, her views are more important than ever.Navigating the intricate intersections of philosophy, science, and culture, her insights illuminate the present moment and offer guidance for navigating future uncertainties.The Posthuman ContextFerrando explores the idea of the posthuman, which questions and goes beyond traditional humanist beliefs. In the introduction, she explains posthumanism as a comprehensive way to understand existence beyond the human-centred perspective that has traditionally shaped philosophy.The writer argues that in the 21st century, understanding our identity means recognising our deep connection with technology, nature, and other species. This view effectively breaks down the strict divisions traditionally defining human life, like human versus machine and natural versus artificial.Ferrando argues that today's world, influenced by the Anthropocene epoch, global health crises, and the rise of artificial intelligence, requires a new way of understanding identity and existence. The Anthropocene epoch, a proposed geological period marked by significant human impact on Earth's climate, ecosystems, and geology through changes like climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and land use alterations, is especially important to her.Her work goes beyond academic study, strongly calling us to adopt a more interconnected and comprehensive view of our place in the world.Human Rights and Ethical ConsiderationsFerrando also critiques traditional human rights frameworks, pointing out their Western-centric origins and their failure to address the complex realities of a posthuman era. She calls for a shift towards a more inclusive idea of rights that includes not just humans but also technological entities and the environment. This broader perspective is essential for dealing with the ethical challenges of our time, especially regarding digital freedom and privacy.She emphasises the interconnectedness of all beings and systems, advocating for a worldview that recognises the rights and autonomy of non-human entities. This new rights framework is crucial in the context of media freedom, where information manipulation and digital platform regulation have significant impacts.Existential Dignity and AgencyAt the heart of Ferrando’s argument is the concept of ‘existential dignity’, which she defines as the intrinsic value that all beings possess due to their ability to exist and interact meaningfully with their environment. This idea is particularly important in the context of media suppression and the widespread use of surveillance technologies.Ferrando argues that dignity is threatened when individuals' data is manipulated in ways that go against their fundamental beliefs and agency. She believes that turning human experiences into commodities, as seen in surveillance capitalism, undermines the basic dignity of both individuals and communities.She broadens her exploration of existential dignity to include technological entities and artificial intelligence. Ferrando examines the ethical challenges of integrating AI and robotics into society while preserving the dignity of both humans and non-human entities. This issue is crucial as AI and machine learning advance quickly, often faster than the development of ethical guidelines and regulations.Technological Enhancement and Ethical FuturesIn her exploration of technological advancement, Ferrando examines the complex areas of biohacking, genetic engineering, and AI. She discusses both the potential benefits, such as enhanced abilities and longer lifespans and the ethical and existential risks associated with these innovations.Ferrando's critique becomes particularly relevant where technological advancements can be used to consolidate authority. The use of AI for surveillance and manipulation has the potential to amplify existing power imbalances, threatening democratic principles. In response, she calls for an ethical framework based on transparency, accountability, and the protection of individual rights in the face of rapid technological progress.Posthumanism as Social WisdomThroughout her book, Ferrando emphasises the need to translate academic philosophy into practical social wisdom. She contends that posthumanism provides a route to a more inclusive and ethical future, one that acknowledges and respects the interconnectedness of all beings. This transformation is essential for tackling the existential challenges of our era, ranging from ecological crises to the erosion of privacy and media freedom.‘The Art of Being Posthuman’ delves into the depths of identity, technology, and ethics in our modern era, offering profound insights against the backdrop of escalating media censorship and omnipresent surveillance. Her revelations illuminate the intricate relationship between humanity and technology. Her impassioned plea for a complete overhaul of human rights and ethical data practices resonates with urgency. She emphasises the critical role of media freedom in fostering a more inclusive and equitable society.A free press acts as a watchdog that holds leaders accountable for corruption and abuses. By providing diverse perspectives, a free press empowers citizens to challenge the regime's narrative, disrupting the dictator's ability to control information flow and shape public opinion. Consequently, dictators resort to censorship, intimidation, and violence to suppress dissent and maintain control.From the vantage point of posthumanism, media freedom is crucial for navigating our interconnected world, transcending traditional human-centric perspectives and acknowledging the interconnectedness of all beings, including technological entities and the environment. It amplifies diverse voices, challenges power structures, and fosters collaboration across human and non-human realms. Ferrando's call for a holistic and inclusive approach to posthumanism envisions a future where dignity, agency, and interconnectedness shape ethical considerations, making ‘The Art of Being Posthuman’ essential reading for anyone grappling with human identity and freedom in the digital age.The Art of Being PosthumanAuthor: Francesca FerrandoYear: 2023Publisher: Polity ","summary":"New York University Professor Francesca Ferrando’s latest book, ‘The Art of Being Posthuman’, explores the complex dynamics between identity, technology, and ethics in contemporary society.

The government did not increase allocation for social security schemes in the budget presented last week, and it did not introduce any new programmes for social security. “If Oli read the inability to spend more on social security as the government’s failure to orient the budget along the constitutional goal of socialism, he is mistaken,” said a finance ministry official on condition of anonymity. “We are facing resource constraints to set aside more funds for such distributive programmes.”“Socialism is a buzzword among communist parties. To be pragmatic, however, the funds available are not enough to introduce a socialism-oriented budget,” the officer told the Post.Nepal’s new constitution, promulgated in 2015, envisions Nepal as a socialism-oriented country. Nonetheless, the private sector has been given control over all important facets of the public and economic spheres.The Nepali Congress champions liberalisation and privatisation, but the party's guiding principle is democratic socialism. Other political parties, including the UML and other communist forces, follow a similar path. Though the constitution mentions Nepal as a socialism-oriented democracy, the charter does not define socialism. Even Parliament has not considered the matter a topic of discussion. “There is a lot of confusion over what socialism actually means in our context,” Surendra Pandey, a former finance minister and vice-chair of the UML, told the Post.Nepal’s political parties should compete in a production-oriented economy rather than a distributive one, Pandey suggested. “If we only focus on distribution-oriented fiscal policies, our economy will eventually stagnate.”A look at world history shows that revolution and evolution are the two bases to achieve socialism, Pandey said. “After their revolutions, countries like France and China nationalised the properties of the erstwhile rulers and distributed them to the public apart from enacting other reforms in order to achieve socialism.”In Nepal, “we need to abide by evolution-based reforms to attain socialism,” Pandey said. Many European countries follow this model. Incomes and properties of the rich are taxed to raise funds for social-security programmes, he added. “However, if we are looking for a distribution-oriented scheme for political gains, then it won’t yield significant results in the long run.”Economists also believe that a socialism-oriented budget is unrealistic during a time of economic hardship. They say the budgets presented even by the erstwhile Oli-led governments were far from socialism-oriented.Oli became prime minister two times: once after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015 and again after the first election held under the same constitution in 2017. The governments he led presented at least three budgets. “Apart from running some fair-price shops or selling some goats and sheep on the occasion of Dashain-Tihar, no government in Nepal has taken any concrete steps to build a socialist-oriented community as mentioned in the constitution,” Dipendra Bahadur Chhetri, a former governor of the Nepal Rastra Bank, told the Post. “This was also true of the previous Oli-led governments.” Chhetri said that the budget for the next fiscal year is conservative. “The communist-led government is always criticised for its distribution-oriented budget, which comes to galvanise its populist agenda,” added Chhetri. “But it’s an illusion to believe that a distribution-oriented budget with a focus on social security schemes is the way towards socialism.”Oli on Saturday instructed his party’s lawmakers to freely criticise the government if they find any instances of budget allocation in breach of the principle. “As a ruling party, we support this budget and will help with its implementation,” Oli said. “However, this does not mean that we should not point out deficiencies in the budget.”Addressing the parliamentary party meeting, Oli expressed his displeasure at lack of consultations among the ruling partners. He also raised the question of whether the budget was prepared by the finance minister himself or by the Maoist party he represents.“The budget could have been much better if the finance minister had engaged in more extensive consultation with the coalition partners,” Oli said.President Ramchandra Paudel presented the government’s policies and programmes in Parliament on May 14. In principle, the finance minister prepares the annual budget based on the policies and programmes and the feedback given by lawmakers during the deliberations on the policies and programmes.However, the policies and programmes could not be discussed in Parliament this time owing to its prolonged obstruction by the main opposition Congress demanding a parliamentary probe in the cooperatives fraud. ","summary":"KP Sharma Oli, the chairman of the major ruling partner CPN-UML, has accused Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun of failing to orient the government’s annual budget towards socialism as per the spirit of the constitution.Addressing a UML parliamentary party meeting on Saturday, Oli pointed out the shortcomings in the budget preparation process and criticised the finance minister for not consulting the UML during its preparation.The remarks by the chief of the largest party in the ruling coalition come as Parliament prepares to start deliberations on the budget, which Pun presented on May 28.“What is the theoretical orientation of the budget, and where do we intend to go?” Oli asked the government led by CPN (Maoist Centre) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal at the party meeting. “All these things should be discussed during deliberations in Parliament,” Oli said, instructing the party’s lawmakers as the parliamentary party leader. The government did not increase allocation for social security schemes in the budget presented last week, and it did not introduce any new programmes for social security. “If Oli read the inability to spend more on social security as the government’s failure to orient the budget along the constitutional goal of socialism, he is mistaken,” said a finance ministry official on condition of anonymity. “We are facing resource constraints to set aside more funds for such distributive programmes.”“Socialism is a buzzword among communist parties. To be pragmatic, however, the funds available are not enough to introduce a socialism-oriented budget,” the officer told the Post.Nepal’s new constitution, promulgated in 2015, envisions Nepal as a socialism-oriented country. Nonetheless, the private sector has been given control over all important facets of the public and economic spheres.The Nepali Congress champions liberalisation and privatisation, but the party's guiding principle is democratic socialism. Other political parties, including the UML and other communist forces, follow a similar path. Though the constitution mentions Nepal as a socialism-oriented democracy, the charter does not define socialism. Even Parliament has not considered the matter a topic of discussion. “There is a lot of confusion over what socialism actually means in our context,” Surendra Pandey, a former finance minister and vice-chair of the UML, told the Post.Nepal’s political parties should compete in a production-oriented economy rather than a distributive one, Pandey suggested. “If we only focus on distribution-oriented fiscal policies, our economy will eventually stagnate.”A look at world history shows that revolution and evolution are the two bases to achieve socialism, Pandey said. “After their revolutions, countries like France and China nationalised the properties of the erstwhile rulers and distributed them to the public apart from enacting other reforms in order to achieve socialism.”In Nepal, “we need to abide by evolution-based reforms to attain socialism,” Pandey said. Many European countries follow this model. Incomes and properties of the rich are taxed to raise funds for social-security programmes, he added. “However, if we are looking for a distribution-oriented scheme for political gains, then it won’t yield significant results in the long run.”Economists also believe that a socialism-oriented budget is unrealistic during a time of economic hardship.

The meeting held at Deuba’s residence in Budhanilkantha was aimed at realigning the coalition for the Madhesh provincial government.The Madhesh government, led by Upendra Yadav’s Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, has been reduced to a minority after the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) withdrew their support to the provincial government.Senior leader Khanal is believed to have played a role in keeping the party within the present coalition, despite efforts from the party chair Nepal and other leaders to change the coalition.During their 45-minute meeting on Thursday, Prime Minister Dahal and Khanal discussed ongoing political developments, including strategies to give continuity to the leftist alliance in the federal and provincial governments, states a press note released by Khanal’s secretariat.Following the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Unified Socialist leader Khanal, the prime minister also spoke to Unified Socialist chair Nepal. “I talked to Madhav Nepal this morning. He won’t join any other alliance and he is not out of this coalition,” Prime Minister Dahal said while talking to media persons at the Biratnagar airport. Dahal added that he believed the Unified Socialist won’t change the ruling coalition at the federal as well as provincial levels.“Our party backs the present coalition, and we are not likely to change the coalition anytime soon,” said Minister for Federal Affairs and General Administration Bhanu Bhakta Joshi of the Unified Socialist. “From the centre to the provincial level, our party has not considered changing the coalition,” Joshi told the Post. On Wednesday, Congress chief Deuba invited Janata Samajbadi Nepal chair Yadav, who recently left the Dahal government, Loktantrik Samajbadi Party chair Mahantha Thakur and Unified Socialist chair Nepal to his residence to discuss the politics of Madhesh.Saroj Kumar Yadav of the JSP Nepal is the incumbent chief minister of Madhesh. However, he lost the majority in the assembly after the UML and the Maoist Centre withdrew their support to the Yadav government on May 12. After the Janata Samajbadi Nepal pulled the plug on the Dahal government in Kathmandu, the major ruling partners also withdrew their support to the Madhesh provincial government.As per Article 168 (4) of the constitution, the chief minister must prove his majority in the Provincial Assembly within 30 days after a coalition partner withdraws support. Yadav constitutionally has to go for the floor test by June 12 but he is set to do that on June 5.“The Congress and the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal sought the support of our party in Madhesh Province at the Wednesday meeting,” Rajendra Pandey, vice-chair of the Unified Socialist, told the Post. “Our party has not decided on the matter, as the day for the floor test is yet to come.” The opposition parties can secure a majority in Madhesh Province if the Unified Socialist gives the trust vote to Yadav, the chief minister.Meanwhile, a meeting of UML, Maoist Centre and Janamat Party leaders in Janakpur on Thursday reached an agreement to form the provincial government led by a Janamat member. According to the agreement, the Unified Socialist and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party have also agreed to join the coalition in the province. Saroj Kumar Yadav of the UML, Bharat Prasad Sah of the Maoist Centre and Mahesh Prasad Yadav of Janamat Party have signed the agreement but no leaders from the Unified Socialist and Loktantrik Samajbadi have put their signatures on it.The UML is the largest party in the province with 24 seats (excluding the Speaker), the Congress has 22, JSP-Nepal 19, Janamat Party 13, Loktantrik Samajbadi 9, Maoist Centre 9, Unified Socialist 7, Sanghiya Samajbadi 1, Nagarik Unmukti 1, and Rastriya Prajatantra Party 1.In the 107-seat assembly, the UML, the Maoist Centre and the CK Raut-led Janamat alone can’t secure a majority.Notably, the Upendra Yadav-led JSP-Nepal is the only party that has got an opportunity to lead a provincial government continuously after the 2017 elections that first formed the provincial legislature. Lalbabu Raut of Yadav’s party remained the chief minister of Madhesh for the full five-year term in the earlier tenure.After the meeting on Wednesday, Unified Socialist Chief Whip in federal parliament Metmani Chaudhary told the Post that his party would support the Madhesh government to foil the attempts of the ruling parties to change the political equation in Janakpur.“We agreed to foil attempts by the ruling parties [in Kathmandu] to oust the present government in Madhesh,” said Chaudhary. “We will extend our support to the Yadav-led government.”But the party changed its position within hours after senior leader Khanal met Prime Minister Dahal. Though Nepal is the party chair, Khanal often prevails in the party’s decisions, if the recent decisions are anything to go by.Earlier, too, when Unified Socialist chair Nepal decided to join the opposition camp led by the Congress to constitute the government in Sudurpaschim, Khanal had reached out to Prime Minister Dahal which ultimately foiled the plan to side with the Congress-led alliance there.However, Pandey, the party vice-chair, claimed that Nepal, as the party chief, has the authority to make decisions. Pandey also claims that such a decision comes after a discussion in the party.“Sometimes Khanal, the senior leader, might feel that he is the one who takes party decisions, this is just his illusion,” Pandey told the Post.Pandey termed Khanal’s meeting with the prime minister and pressurising the party to change its decision as unacceptable.Is a senior leader of the party prevailing over the party chair?Replying to the question raised by the Post, Khanal said, “If someone takes the unfolding of the events in that way, I have nothing much to say, but I believe our party should continue the present ruling coalition without if and buts.”Khanal also said that, as a communist leader who fought to advance the communist movement in Nepal, he will do everything to make the communist party strong. The Unified Socialist is holding its general convention from June 30 to July 4. Nepal and Khanal are likely to face each other for the party’s top post at the convention.After the UML and the Maoist Centre, the major ruling partners, decided to support the Nagarik Unmukti Party in Sudurpaschim, the Unified Socialist decided to change the camp. A meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Khanal also led to the appointment of Dirgharaj Sodari as the chief minister. Assembly party leader of the Unified Socialist, Sodari was appointed to the post on April 18 despite serious reservations from the UML.Sodari won the confidence motion in the provincial assembly on May 15 but the UML and the Maoist Centre have yet to join the Cabinet. A month after its formation, the Sodari Cabinet has yet to get full shape. Federal Minister for Industry Commerce and Supplies Damodar Bhandari on Thursday criticised the party for its unstable policy. Bhandari, a minister from the UML, accused Unified Socialist chair Nepal, saying, “Due to the dubious role played by the Unified Socialist leadership, the Sudurpaschim government is unable to take full shape.”A group of UML leaders formed the Unified Socialist, led by Madhav Nepal, in 2021. But the party performed poorly in the elections held the following year at all levels. It failed to secure even the status of a national political party in the 2022 general elections.The party, which has 10 seats in the House of Representatives, has been in government for most of the 18 months since. ","summary":"Separate meetings of two top leaders of the CPN (Unified Socialist) with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Nepali Congress leader Sher Bahadur Deuba have sparked a debate again whether the new party was divided along factional lines under Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal.Former prime minister Khanal met Dahal on Thursday while the party chair, Madhav Nepal, attended a meeting of opposition parties on Wednesday convened by the main opposition leader Deuba. The meeting held at Deuba’s residence in Budhanilkantha was aimed at realigning the coalition for the Madhesh provincial government.The Madhesh government, led by Upendra Yadav’s Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, has been reduced to a minority after the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) withdrew their support to the provincial government.Senior leader Khanal is believed to have played a role in keeping the party within the present coalition, despite efforts from the party chair Nepal and other leaders to change the coalition.During their 45-minute meeting on Thursday, Prime Minister Dahal and Khanal discussed ongoing political developments, including strategies to give continuity to the leftist alliance in the federal and provincial governments, states a press note released by Khanal’s secretariat.Following the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Unified Socialist leader Khanal, the prime minister also spoke to Unified Socialist chair Nepal. “I talked to Madhav Nepal this morning. He won’t join any other alliance and he is not out of this coalition,” Prime Minister Dahal said while talking to media persons at the Biratnagar airport. Dahal added that he believed the Unified Socialist won’t change the ruling coalition at the federal as well as provincial levels.“Our party backs the present coalition, and we are not likely to change the coalition anytime soon,” said Minister for Federal Affairs and General Administration Bhanu Bhakta Joshi of the Unified Socialist. “From the centre to the provincial level, our party has not considered changing the coalition,” Joshi told the Post. On Wednesday, Congress chief Deuba invited Janata Samajbadi Nepal chair Yadav, who recently left the Dahal government, Loktantrik Samajbadi Party chair Mahantha Thakur and Unified Socialist chair Nepal to his residence to discuss the politics of Madhesh.Saroj Kumar Yadav of the JSP Nepal is the incumbent chief minister of Madhesh. However, he lost the majority in the assembly after the UML and the Maoist Centre withdrew their support to the Yadav government on May 12. After the Janata Samajbadi Nepal pulled the plug on the Dahal government in Kathmandu, the major ruling partners also withdrew their support to the Madhesh provincial government.As per Article 168 (4) of the constitution, the chief minister must prove his majority in the Provincial Assembly within 30 days after a coalition partner withdraws support. Yadav constitutionally has to go for the floor test by June 12 but he is set to do that on June 5.“The Congress and the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal sought the support of our party in Madhesh Province at the Wednesday meeting,” Rajendra Pandey, vice-chair of the Unified Socialist, told the Post. “Our party has not decided on the matter, as the day for the floor test is yet to come.” The opposition parties can secure a majority in Madhesh Province if the Unified Socialist gives the trust vote to Yadav, the chief minister.Meanwhile, a meeting of UML, Maoist Centre and Janamat Party leaders in Janakpur on Thursday reached an agreement to form the provincial government led by a Janamat member. According to the agreement, the Unified Socialist and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party have also agreed to join the coalition in the province. Saroj Kumar Yadav of the UML, Bharat Prasad Sah of the Maoist Centre and Mahesh Prasad Yadav of Janamat Party have signed the agreement but no leaders from the Unified Socialist and Loktantrik Samajbadi have put their signatures on it.The UML is the largest party in the province with 24 seats (excluding the Speaker), the Congress has 22, JSP-Nepal 19, Janamat Party 13, Loktantrik Samajbadi 9, Maoist Centre 9, Unified Socialist 7, Sanghiya Samajbadi 1, Nagarik Unmukti 1, and Rastriya Prajatantra Party 1.In the 107-seat assembly, the UML, the Maoist Centre and the CK Raut-led Janamat alone can’t secure a majority.Notably, the Upendra Yadav-led JSP-Nepal is the only party that has got an opportunity to lead a provincial government continuously after the 2017 elections that first formed the provincial legislature. Lalbabu Raut of Yadav’s party remained the chief minister of Madhesh for the full five-year term in the earlier tenure.After the meeting on Wednesday, Unified Socialist Chief Whip in federal parliament Metmani Chaudhary told the Post that his party would support the Madhesh government to foil the attempts of the ruling parties to change the political equation in Janakpur.“We agreed to foil attempts by the ruling parties [in Kathmandu] to oust the present government in Madhesh,” said Chaudhary. “We will extend our support to the Yadav-led government.”But the party changed its position within hours after senior leader Khanal met Prime Minister Dahal. Though Nepal is the party chair, Khanal often prevails in the party’s decisions, if the recent decisions are anything to go by.Earlier, too, when Unified Socialist chair Nepal decided to join the opposition camp led by the Congress to constitute the government in Sudurpaschim, Khanal had reached out to Prime Minister Dahal which ultimately foiled the plan to side with the Congress-led alliance there.However, Pandey, the party vice-chair, claimed that Nepal, as the party chief, has the authority to make decisions. Pandey also claims that such a decision comes after a discussion in the party.“Sometimes Khanal, the senior leader, might feel that he is the one who takes party decisions, this is just his illusion,” Pandey told the Post.Pandey termed Khanal’s meeting with the prime minister and pressurising the party to change its decision as unacceptable.Is a senior leader of the party prevailing over the party chair?Replying to the question raised by the Post, Khanal said, “If someone takes the unfolding of the events in that way, I have nothing much to say, but I believe our party should continue the present ruling coalition without if and buts.”Khanal also said that, as a communist leader who fought to advance the communist movement in Nepal, he will do everything to make the communist party strong. The Unified Socialist is holding its general convention from June 30 to July 4. Nepal and Khanal are likely to face each other for the party’s top post at the convention.After the UML and the Maoist Centre, the major ruling partners, decided to support the Nagarik Unmukti Party in Sudurpaschim, the Unified Socialist decided to change the camp. A meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Khanal also led to the appointment of Dirgharaj Sodari as the chief minister. Assembly party leader of the Unified Socialist, Sodari was appointed to the post on April 18 despite serious reservations from the UML.Sodari won the confidence motion in the provincial assembly on May 15 but the UML and the Maoist Centre have yet to join the Cabinet. A month after its formation, the Sodari Cabinet has yet to get full shape. Federal Minister for Industry Commerce and Supplies Damodar Bhandari on Thursday criticised the party for its unstable policy. Bhandari, a minister from the UML, accused Unified Socialist chair Nepal, saying, “Due to the dubious role played by the Unified Socialist leadership, the Sudurpaschim government is unable to take full shape.”A group of UML leaders formed the Unified Socialist, led by Madhav Nepal, in 2021. But the party performed poorly in the elections held the following year at all levels. It failed to secure even the status of a national political party in the 2022 general elections.The party, which has 10 seats in the House of Representatives, has been in government for most of the 18 months since.

This is neither Rana nor Shah regime or military rule,” said Ramhari Khatiwada, chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the House. “Home minister should stop humiliating people, and he too is not above the law.”Khatiwada said that he had sought time with Home Minister Lamichhane to discuss the issue on Friday but he did not give him time. He said that the government should formulate a law first and bring regulations if it thinks deploying rule violators for traffic management is necessary.The Metropolitan Traffic Police Division of Kathmandu said that it had deployed 1,302 people who were booked for traffic rules violations, including drunk driving, on Wednesday.“We are only implementing the instructions of the higher agency,” said Jeevan Kumar Shrestha, the division’s spokesperson. “We provided basic instructions to the rule violators and deployed them on streets for traffic management.”When asked if rules violators would help traffic police manage Kathmandu’s traffic, Shrestha said that even the traffic police, who received one to one-and-a-half years of training, sometimes could not handle the traffic chaos.Former senior officials at Nepal Police also questioned the intention of the home minister to force traffic rule violators to stay on the roads. They say that existing law doesn't support the home minister’s decision, and it also jeopardises the safety of those being deployed on the streets.“The decision to deploy rule violators is against the will of the people, which is against the provision that the state will not force anyone to serve against their will,” said Hemanta Malla, former deputy inspector general of Nepal Police. “This decision can be challenged in court.”Managing traffic is an expert’s job. Traffic police, who have worked for years in Valley's traffic management, also sometimes find the job challenging. Legal experts said that the home minister should bring law and regulation first if he thinks the valley's traffic would be better managed by forcing rule violators to stay on the roads.“The decision is against the principle of the rule of law.

Those children were administered only Type-1 and Type-3 polio oral vaccines and had missed the Type-2 polio vaccine.Officials at the Immunisation Section of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services estimated that thousands of children throughout the country neither go to school nor participate in health care programmes.“Providing health care services, including routine vaccines, to those populations is the most challenging task,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, the section chief. “Chances of those groups missing the services, including the routine vaccines, are always there. We will send health workers to the at-risk areas to find such children.”Healthworkers found over 74,000 children out of school nationwide during the measles-rubella campaign launched in February. “We are aware of the children who are out of school,” said Gautam. “Floating population, scattered slums, working-class people, lack of awareness and poor access to health workers are major challenges to health workers. We will send health workers to the areas designated as risk zones.”Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but the World Health Organisation officially gave the status on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV). The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus. The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus. However, the Type-2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in South Asia to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Health officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.The government's number one priority is childhood immunisation, under which 13 types of vaccines are given free of charge against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis, and typhoid, under the regular immunisation programme.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.However, the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all. This figure was one percent in 2016. The Ministry of Health and Population said that the nationwide vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 percent.

This is considered an epidemic season, in which hundreds of thousands of people get infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases and snakebites.“Over six to eight snakebite victims seek treatment in our hospital daily,” said Dr Bimal Sharma Chalise of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “Number of patients seeking snakebite treatment has gone up after a rise in rainfall activities.”Along with water-borne and vector-borne diseases, snakebites and resulting deaths are common in Nepal during the rainy season.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snake bites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Along with snakebite cases,the number of patients infected with diarrheal ailments, fever and jaundice has also risen in the hospital.“Most of the snakebite victims seeking care at our hospital are either from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from the districts adjoining the Valley,” said Chalise. “Most of the snakebite victims are farmers, women and children who work or play in the fields or go to the jungle to collect fodder for their cattle.”Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health issue usually triggered by food and water safety or hygiene issues. The disease, which has been associated with higher temperatures, is one of Nepal’s leading causes of morbidity and mortality.Doctors at the hospital say around half a dozen diarrheal patients are also seeking treatment every day. Similarly, patients having jaundice and fever due to typhoid are also seeking care at the hospital.Typhoid fever, usually called typhoid, is a highly contagious disease caused by Salmonella typhi, which spreads through contaminated food or water. Studies have shown that the disease can be fatal in up to 10 percent of the reported cases.Typhoid fever has been found throughout the world, but the problem is acute in areas without safe drinking water and sanitation. Nepal has also recorded major typhoid outbreaks in the past, but very few cases have been reported in the last few years.Nepal introduced the typhoid vaccine in the routine vaccination programme in 2022.The Ministry of Health and Population launched a month-long nationwide vaccination campaign against typhoid, during which around seven million children between the ages of 15 months and 15 years were inoculated.“Cases of water-borne diseases and snakebite have started to spike of late,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Hospital. “We should all be cautious about the food and water we eat and drink. We must ensure that food and water is safe before eating.”Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive against the risks. They say that people living in thatched-roof houses are also highly vulnerable to snakebite, as snakes visit such homes in search of rats. They say that people should be asked to keep their houses and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in the bush, avoid walking at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.“Most of the water resources get contaminated during monsoon season, as rainwater gets mixed in the water resources,” Pun said.

They say that people should be asked to keep their houses and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in the bush, avoid walking at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.“Most of the water resources get contaminated during monsoon season, as rainwater gets mixed in the water resources,” Pun said.

These products were found to contain ethylene oxide, a cancer-causing chemical, and several countries have launched an investigation.On May 18, Nepal’s quality watchdog, the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control, banned the sale and import of popular Indian spice brands MDH and Everest with immediate effect. The quality watchdog also decided to recall and seize products that are in the customs clearance process.After nearly two weeks, the department said they had requested India to provide chemicals but the neighbour had yet to respond.“We lack the capacity to conduct the lab test on ethylene oxide. Soon after the ban, we asked India’s Food Safety Authority for chemicals and methods for lab testing. There is no further development,” said Mohan Krishna Maharjan, spokesperson for the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control.According to the department, the lab test will help determine the level of ethylene oxide in Everest and MDH spice brands.Maharjan said that the problematic batch of spice has already been banned and recalled, so it is not available in the market. “The important thing is that the batch of banned spice is not reaching consumers’ kitchens, so we do not need a lab test report immediately.”Though the department said that the importers had recalled the product, few online shopping sites showed the availability of fish curry spice from Everest in their stock. Online shopping platforms like thulo.com, pricemandu.com, bpazes.com, and wholesalepasalplus.com showed 50 gm of spice available.Consumer rights activists said that when consumer rights and public health are not the government's priority, they do not matter to them. “The delay shows how irresponsible our government is towards consumer rights and public health. It has been two weeks since the country banned the spice, but the department is still ignorant of the level of ethylene oxide in the spice sold in Nepal,” said Bishnu Prasad Timilsina, general secretary of the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights Nepal.But Maharjan said that when other countries conduct the test, performing the lab test in Nepal is optional.Maharjan said that the department has directed the importers to recall the problematic batch of spice from the market. “We are yet to get data from importers on the quantity and value of the spice recalled from the market.” The department has requested the test report from domestic importers. Maharjan said that once the lab test report arrives, action will be taken regarding the recalled spice.The department said the domestic importers of Everest and MDH brands had not sought permits to import the spice from India as the sales declined soon after the news on ethylene oxide in the spices surfaced.Nepal moved to ban the spice following the bans by several countries, including Singapore and Hong Kong, and scrutiny by the Australian and Maldivian authorities. Malaysia is the latest country to ban the spices.After deciding to ban the spice, the department said it would allow its sale, import, and distribution once it was cleared from the manufacturing country, with proof of safety for consumption.Experts say the presence of ethylene oxide, a flammable colourless gas with a sweet odour, in the spices is concerning, as varieties of the products of both companies are easily available in Nepal and are popular, too.Ethylene oxide is primarily used to produce other chemicals, including antifreeze. In smaller amounts, it is also used as a pesticide and sterilising agent.Lymphoma and leukaemia are the cancers most frequently associated with occupational exposure to ethylene oxide.

Climbers from 60 countries started a month-and-a-half-long journey from Kathmandu to Lukla, the gateway to Everest, then to base camp and the summit. The journey brought joy to many and tears to a few who lost their nearest and dearest.From hotels to airlines, restaurants to choppers, all saw their businesses thrive. Everest has now grown into a multimillion-dollar industry. Nepal’s top court wants to stop this commercialisation to preserve the heritage for future generations.Before the start of the climbing season, the Supreme Court issued a mandamus order directing the government to regulate the rising number of expeditions on the world’s tallest mountain.A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Sushma Lata Mathema has ordered the government to issue climbing permits only after specifying the number of climbers and within the capacity to safely accommodate them. The court order followed increasing traffic jams on the world’s highest peak, and the trash people leave on its slopes. Everest has even been called the ‘world's highest garbage dump’.According to a preliminary report of the Department of Tourism, the government agency that issues climbing permits and monitors activities, eight people died on the mountain—including three who have been reportedly missing but presumed dead—this season. Last year, according to the department, 17 people died on Everest.Climbing guides say the 2024 spring expedition was a mix of triumph and tragedy. Rakesh Gurung, director of the department, said there was a significant improvement in safety this year. This year, the department issued permits to 421 fee-paying individuals to climb Everest, a significant drop from last year’s 479 permits. Expedition agencies are also concerned about overcrowding of routes as the number of inexperienced climbers grows.“We have asked the government on multiple occasions to make some climbing experience mandatory before one is permitted to ascend the world’s highest peak,” said Mingma G, managing director of Imagine Nepal, an expedition organiser. “The 6,500 metres peak in Nepal or elsewhere should be made mandatory for practising as that will reduce risk. This will make the new climbers experienced before planning to take on Everest.”“This initiative, in fact, will reduce the casualties.”There are also other benefits of this approach.It will promote the unclimbed peaks, increase government revenue, and generate additional jobs.Nepal has implemented a slew of new rules in the Himalayas, including mandatory carrying of tracking devices and poo bags while summiting the peak, but has never had the rule of climbing smaller peaks before heading to Everest.Jagat Prasad Bhusal, chief administrative officer of the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, said the rural municipality sold 1,700 poo bags. “We have received good feedback on their use and carrying back in the first year of implementing the rule.”He said that five bodies were brought back. The weather behaved well on Everest this season.Expedition operators say the good weather window was open for more than two weeks. There was no disturbance in the form of fierce wind or snow blizzard after May 19. This year, the Icefall doctors, the experts entrusted to fix ladders at the Khumbu Icefall, the most dangerous part of the Everest climb lodged between the base camp and Camp I, shifted the path to its old course.This dangerous section, navigated hundreds of times during the season, was changed after 10 years. Between 1953 and 2023, almost 50 sherpas died in the Icefall.The 2014 avalanche on Everest, which killed 16 Sherpa guides, prompted authorities in 2015 to change the path to the centre to avoid the left side of the Khumbu Icefall.“This year, the route was opened in the old section,” said Mingma Sherpa, chairman at Seven Summit Treks, who is the first Nepali as well as the first South Asian to summit all 8,000-ers in the world.He, too, said that the best option is to ask new climbers to get some experience before they try the 8,848.86-metre Everest.Critics say crowds are growing on Everest, causing unusual traffic jams, which often result in the death of climbers.“But the reality is different,” said Mingma. “For example, permits were issued to 421 climbers this year, but only half of them opted to climb. Still, 600 people reached the summit. That means, for one foreign climber, two Nepali guides are mobilised,” he said. “All this is to ensure their safety.”The casualty record in the last 10 years shows that the people who die on Everest are mostly sherpas, and the primary reason is avalanches.Expedition organisers say climbers dying on Everest due to traffic jams is a rare incident.In April 2014, there was an avalanche near Everest Base Camp, which killed 16 Nepali guides.Then in 2015, avalanches set off by the devastating April 25 quake killed 20 climbers, including high-altitude guides and helpers at the base camp and the Khumbu Icefall.In 2016 and 2017, Everest claimed the lives of six and five climbers, respectively.This year, two foreign climbers died because they decided not to hire climbing guides or use supplemental oxygen. Similarly, a missing British climber and his Sherpa guide, who have been presumed dead, were caught in a sudden cornice fall.“It’s not possible to bring the casualties to zero due to multiple factors, which kill people on Everest. However, by making climbers experienced, we can reduce the casualties significantly,” said Mingma Sherpa.According to the Himalayan Database, which compiles records for all expeditions and deaths in the Himalayas, there were more than 200 deaths on the Nepal side of Everest between 1953, when Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa first scaled the peak, and 2022.Nepal’s tourism ministry started collecting details of events on Everest from 1922 when seven Sherpa climbers died in an avalanche, becoming the first reported deaths on the tallest mountain. But it has no archive of those who lost their lives on the icy slopes.The rising number of deaths has not dented Everest's popularity. Rather, the number of aspiring summiteers keeps growing. A record 658 climbers reached its top in the spring of 2022.The tourism department said there were 644 successes in 2023, slightly below the 2022 figure.The Everest season is one of the high-end tourism market segments of the country.The 400 climbing permits generate jobs for 4,000 people, from airlines to hotels and from choppers to porters—mostly in the mountain community, where the government’s promised facilities and infrastructure are poor, according to analysts.There were many records made this year.Kami Rita Sherpa, a seasoned mountaineer, etched his name in history by conquering Everest for the 30th time. He climbed Everest twice this season.Phunjo Lama, a Nepali woman, became the first woman in the world to climb Everest in the fastest time.Lama started her ascent from the base camp, situated at an altitude of 5,364 metres, at 3:52 pm on May 22. She reached the summit of 8,848.86 metres at 6:23 am on May 23 and returned to the base camp at 4:18 pm the same day, completing the climb in 24 hours and 26 minutes.Dawa Finjok Sherpa scaled the world's highest mountain three times in just eight days.Poornima Shrestha, a photojournalist, became the first woman to summit Everest three times in a single climbing season, all in 13 days.Along with success, there were deaths too.The season’s first casualties were two Mongolian climbers. The Mongolian duo, climbing Everest without supplemental oxygen and Sherpa guides, went missing on May 13. They were found dead on May 17.On May 21, British climber Daniel Paul Paterson and his Sherpa guide Pastenji went missing in the death zone.“On the early morning of May 21 at around 4:40 am, climbers Paterson and Pastenji Sherpa heroically reached the summit of Everest. Tragically, during their descent near the Hillary Step at approximately 8,800 metres, they were caught in a sudden cornice fall, which impacted the group of climbers,” Lakpa Sherpa, managing director of 8K Expedition, wrote on his Facebook page.“Despite exhaustive search efforts, we regret to confirm that we were unable to recover the bodies of Daniel and Pastenji.”On May 22, a Kenyan climber Cheruiyot Kirui died a few metres below the Everest summit, and his Sherpa guide, Nawang Sherpa, went missing.On May 22, Binod Babu Bastakoti, a Nepali national, died near the south Col while descending from the summit.Indian climber Banshi Lal was rescued from Camp IV but died during treatment in a hospital in Kathmandu on May 27, according to the department.Nearly 9,000 mountaineers have summited Everest from the Nepal side since Tenzing Norgay and the New Zealander Edmund Hillary first set foot atop the world’s highest peak in 1953.

Tragically, during their descent near the Hillary Step at approximately 8,800 metres, they were caught in a sudden cornice fall, which impacted the group of climbers,” Lakpa Sherpa, managing director of 8K Expedition, wrote on his Facebook page.“Despite exhaustive search efforts, we regret to confirm that we were unable to recover the bodies of Daniel and Pastenji.”On May 22, a Kenyan climber Cheruiyot Kirui died a few metres below the Everest summit, and his Sherpa guide, Nawang Sherpa, went missing.On May 22, Binod Babu Bastakoti, a Nepali national, died near the south Col while descending from the summit.Indian climber Banshi Lal was rescued from Camp IV but died during treatment in a hospital in Kathmandu on May 27, according to the department.Nearly 9,000 mountaineers have summited Everest from the Nepal side since Tenzing Norgay and the New Zealander Edmund Hillary first set foot atop the world’s highest peak in 1953.

Those who were administered the first dose were supposed to take the second dose of vaccine in six months.Health authorities first launched the second dose vaccination in federal hospitals in all the provinces, but due to a low uptake, they sent vaccinators to schools. The vaccination programme was suspended later after vaccinators failed to track the girls who were administered the first dose.Officials hoped that girls would seek a second dose of the vaccine after completing the SEE examination, but that too did not happen.Human papillomavirus is a viral infection that spreads through skin contact. The virus causes cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer in the developing world and a major cause of death among Nepali women. Hundreds of women get diagnosed with cervical cancer every year in Nepal.According to the BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital in Bharatpur, more than 700 women suffering from cervical cancer seek treatment at the hospital every year.Doctors say most cervical cancer cases are associated with HPV, a sexually transmitted infection and that widespread immunisation could reduce the impact of cervical and other cancers caused by the HPV worldwide.Countries like Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives have introduced the HPV vaccine nationally, while India and Indonesia have introduced it in some districts.In 2016, Nepal piloted HPV vaccination in Chitwan and Kaski districts. All girls aged between 11 and 13 years were then given two doses of the vaccine.Experts say early treatment prevents up to 80 percent of cervical cancer.HPV vaccination was also included in the government’s policies and programmes for the next fiscal year 2024-25, which is a repetition of the past several years. Health ministry officials, who used to claim that HPV vaccination would be available to all eligible girls in 2022, said a nationwide HPV vaccination drive is likely in 2025 only.The ministry plans to inoculate around 1.7 million girls between 10 and 14 years with the HPV vaccine through nationwide drives and also make it part of regular immunisation.According to officials, the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI) has agreed to provide HPV vaccine doses. Once the campaign is completed, the vaccine will be included in the government’s routine immunisation programme.Nepal submitted a proposal to GAVI in July last year requesting free HPV doses so that the vaccine could be included on the regular immunisation list. Ministry officials say they have proposed a budget for nationwide HPV vaccination campaigns in 2025.Officials say that GAVI has already agreed to provide required vaccine doses, but the problem is their availability. The World Health Organisation says HPV vaccination is recommended as part of a coordinated strategy to prevent cervical cancer and other diseases caused by the virus.The UN health body says HPV is responsible for more than 70 percent of cervical cancer cases in women. Countries that have included the HPV vaccine in their regular immunisation list have successfully reduced cervical cancer cases in women, according to doctors.

The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus. The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus. However, the Type -2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in the South Asia region to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN Health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Gautam said that due to global shortages of the IPV vaccine, children born between April 13, 2016, and October 18, 2018, were inoculated only with the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine.“Children who missed the IPV vaccine will be at high risk of poliovirus infection,” warned Gautam. “So we are launching a campaign to inoculate them.”Health Officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.Childhood immunisation is the number one priority of the government, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, however, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve "},{"hash":"4f18229de2a5d8016e8888758de34cc858e98af2b542ed3077fa8ab2d1e49a3b","title":"patience-passion-and-pastries","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/recipes/2024/04/27/patience-passion-and-pastries","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/BakeleusbyCeleus-1714186343.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1714176000000,"source":"kp","category":"recipes","content":"Celeus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense.

Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally.

According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms.

Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many?

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution.

During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. ","summary":"The gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) ","summary":"Nepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’.

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  ","summary":"Gyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while.

A weather station in Delhi recorded a temperature of 52.9 degrees Celsius, which, if confirmed, would be a national record. Animals have died, students have fainted at schools and drinking water taps have dried up. A labourer reportedly died of heatstroke last week.It's not only India. Mexico is in the grip of a heatwave that has killed at least 48 people since March. The \"heat dome\" hovering over the central American nation is set to move to the United States in coming days.Heat is the silent killer that is responsible for more deaths than any other natural disaster. Several severe European heat waves in recent decades, including last summer, have claimed tens of thousands of excess deaths.Death tolls in developing countries are not properly counted and probably much larger.But worse is coming and we need to prepare for it. The average surface temperature on Earth is now at its highest level since records began and probably before the last ice age. Recent heat waves show clear fingerprints of global warming, more so than any other climate change impact such as flood or drought. And global warming will continue at least until we reach net zero.There is a fundamental limit to the body's coping ability: it is a fixed goalpost.Research in 2010 demonstrated that a 'wet-bulb' temperature of 35 degrees Celsius or higher would make it impossible for humans to exhaust metabolic heat, due to our fixed core body temperature.It proposed this was an effective survivability limit. The wet-bulb temperature measures the ability to cool by evaporation; it equals normal temperature if relative humidity is 100 percent, and otherwise is lower. 35C is extreme—most places on Earth never experience wet bulbs above 30C. But enough global warming could push heat waves in many areas past 35C. This upended the widely held assumption at the time that humans could adapt to any amount of increased heat, i.e., that the goalposts would move. This goalpost will not.Wet-bulb temperature is used by meteorologists and climatologists to quantify heat stress. It is a combination of heat and humidity: a high wet bulb can occur in humid places at lower temperatrues, as well as in dry places at extremely high temperatures.New studies are beginning to chart out the road to 35C. One study in the US last year found that young, healthy subjects exposed to very hot conditions started to enter hyperthermia (inability to regulate core body temperature) well below 35C wet bulb, closer to 32C or less. This is an important reminder that 35C was a theoretical upper limit, not a practical one.On the other hand they would undoubtedly have found a higher tolerance had they done the study in India or Brazil, because physiology does adjust to heat over time (up to a point). The UK has a long way to go before reaching 32C and could acclimatise for a while. Wet-bulb temperatures above 32C appear only very rarely today in coastal areas of the Middle East and for very short periods, but these will gradually spread as warming continues.The heat will force us to change how we live, for example shifting outdoor summertime activities to nighttime or just eliminating them. Severe heat may already be putting people off traveling to Europe or other locations in the summer.Researchers at the University of Sydney are developing a heat warning system, and conducting exposure studies similar to the US one. It looks like we'll soon have a clearer picture of the direct effects of severe heat on physiology.It remains challenging to measure or predict extreme heat's overall cost to the community in terms of health, work and quality of life. To do this, climate and health researchers need to develop models that factor in human behaviour and adaptation along with physiology, weather, and climate information. We also need to understand what will happen to nature, and seek ways to protect wildlife. Above all we need to reach net zero carbon emissions as soon as we possibly can to arrest the continuing rise in heat.-360info ","summary":"The headlines coming out of India as it grappled with an extreme heatwave the past few days have been alarming.

Recent heat waves show clear fingerprints of global warming, more so than any other climate change impact such as flood or drought. And global warming will continue at least until we reach net zero.There is a fundamental limit to the body's coping ability: it is a fixed goalpost.Research in 2010 demonstrated that a 'wet-bulb' temperature of 35 degrees Celsius or higher would make it impossible for humans to exhaust metabolic heat, due to our fixed core body temperature.It proposed this was an effective survivability limit. The wet-bulb temperature measures the ability to cool by evaporation; it equals normal temperature if relative humidity is 100 percent, and otherwise is lower. 35C is extreme—most places on Earth never experience wet bulbs above 30C. But enough global warming could push heat waves in many areas past 35C. This upended the widely held assumption at the time that humans could adapt to any amount of increased heat, i.e., that the goalposts would move. This goalpost will not.Wet-bulb temperature is used by meteorologists and climatologists to quantify heat stress. It is a combination of heat and humidity: a high wet bulb can occur in humid places at lower temperatrues, as well as in dry places at extremely high temperatures.New studies are beginning to chart out the road to 35C. One study in the US last year found that young, healthy subjects exposed to very hot conditions started to enter hyperthermia (inability to regulate core body temperature) well below 35C wet bulb, closer to 32C or less. This is an important reminder that 35C was a theoretical upper limit, not a practical one.On the other hand they would undoubtedly have found a higher tolerance had they done the study in India or Brazil, because physiology does adjust to heat over time (up to a point). The UK has a long way to go before reaching 32C and could acclimatise for a while. Wet-bulb temperatures above 32C appear only very rarely today in coastal areas of the Middle East and for very short periods, but these will gradually spread as warming continues.The heat will force us to change how we live, for example shifting outdoor summertime activities to nighttime or just eliminating them. Severe heat may already be putting people off traveling to Europe or other locations in the summer.Researchers at the University of Sydney are developing a heat warning system, and conducting exposure studies similar to the US one. It looks like we'll soon have a clearer picture of the direct effects of severe heat on physiology.It remains challenging to measure or predict extreme heat's overall cost to the community in terms of health, work and quality of life. To do this, climate and health researchers need to develop models that factor in human behaviour and adaptation along with physiology, weather, and climate information. We also need to understand what will happen to nature, and seek ways to protect wildlife. Above all we need to reach net zero carbon emissions as soon as we possibly can to arrest the continuing rise in heat.-360info "},{"hash":"0c5f7085f62a79779660162cd0dda41900f76f048ce2d6f5e95c42461435c574","title":"constitution-coalition-and-instability","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/05/30/constitution-coalition-and-instability","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/LeadPostIllustration-1717084874.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1717027200000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"Scapegoating the 2015 constitution has become Nepali politicians’ latest sing-along. They blame the constitution for the government’s instability, and then the instability for the deepening despondency in the country. They argue stability is possible only if we have a one-party government. However, with a constitutional provision for proportional representation, no party can win a parliamentary majority, making a one-party government impossible. The politicians claim they have no option but to form a coalition government, but coalitions are inherently unstable. The only way to a stable, one-party government is to eliminate the provision of proportional representation. Experience elsewhere shows that a multi-party coalition has little to do with government instability. A government becomes unstable when those responsible for implementing the constitution do not respect the constitutional spirit. Coalition and instabilityMost of Europe has long been governed by coalition governments. Take Germany, for example. Since the establishment of the Federal Republic in 1949, Germany has had a single-party government only once, from 1957 to 1961. All others have been in stable coalitions, which have turned the country into Europe’s economic powerhouse over the years. Germany also uses a mixed first-past-the-post and proportional electoral system. Every voter has two votes: One for the constituency candidate and the other for a political party. The proportional system has not been a handicap for stable governments. Israel has never had a single-party government. Despite the never-ending series of coalition governments, the country has done well economically and militarily. Manmohan Singh ruled India for 10 years as the head of a coalition of several parties. His government is credited with a breakthrough in India’s economy, catapulting the country to the world stage. As a coalition government is not a recipe for instability, a single-party government is not a prerequisite for stability and economic progress. North Korea has had a stable single-party government for a long time. It is an economic basket case. Our own partyless Panchayat regime ensured political stability for 30 years. Yet, all we have from those is the 1,000-km East-West highway and a few factories, all built with foreign aid. Additionally, a single-party majority in the parliament comes with serious risks when the party's leader abuses the constitution to further their ego and personal ambitions. Adolf Hitler came to power using democratic means. Recep Erdogan of Turkey and Victor Orbán of Hungary are recent examples. They have used their majorities in their respective parliaments to muzzle the media and undermine the judiciary; in short, they undermine democracy. Under Narendra Modi’s single-party rule, India’s free media—once a shining light of the Indian democracy—has been bent to serve Modi’s ambitions. The country’s much-vaunted judiciary is compromised; opposition leaders are routinely thrown behind bars; Muslims, who comprise 14 percent of the population, have been marginalised, and secularism is under threat.Instability and political leadersIn the past 76 years, Nepal has written seven constitutions (including the Interim Acts of 1948 and 1951) and trashed six because they did not work. Instead of blaming the constitution for government instability, we should ask why our constitutions have not worked. The conversation between the two prominent politicians, Rishikesh Shah and BP Koirala, in 1968, soon after BP's release from Sundarijal, may provide an answer. I happened to be standing behind the two when they were talking. Shah argued that a flaw in the constitution—an obscure clause which vested emergency powers in the King—allowed King Mahendra to arrest BP and dissolve the parliament. Koirala responded, “Shahji! No constitution is perfect. If those responsible for implementing the constitution have respect for its spirit, nothing like what the King did would have happened”. “You know, Professor,” BP continued, “According to the Constitution of the Soviet Union (The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics), all Republics in the Union had full independence to secede, should they decide to do so. Yet, the Soviets sent their tanks even to independent countries like Hungary and Czechoslovakia when they challenged Moscow's grip on their countries. The British Monarch has several emergency powers, including dissolving parliament, but he does not now exercise them. Clearly, to the Soviets in Moscow, the constitution is just a piece of paper; to British monarchs, precedent, established democratic norms, and tradition are not to be violated”. Democracy and government stability are ensured only when the leaders are honourable and operate with high ethical and moral standards, respecting the spirit of the constitution and established democratic norms. This includes ensuring that the parliament functions properly.We buried the 1990 constitution and ushered in a new one in 2015 but not the political leaders responsible for implementing it. We failed to recognise that changing the constitution does not change the behaviour of leaders whose focus is to enrich themselves and their party. The trio of Sher Bahadur Deuba, KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal is still in command, and their manners have not changed. It is not the constitution but the non-stop jostling for political power among the trio that causes frequent blocking of Parliament and government instability. Some parts of the constitution require more clarity and consistency, but dropping the provision for proportional representation is not one of them. What is urgently needed is freeing the country from the stranglehold of the three major party leaders who have repeatedly shown little respect for democratic norms and the spirit of the constitution.  ","summary":"Scapegoating the 2015 constitution has become Nepali politicians’ latest sing-along.

In March, water samples from the source, community schools and taps of seven wards of Godawari Municipality in Lalitpur were found contaminated with faecal coliform and microorganisms found in faeces. Despite being a country rich in water resources, the government and authorities have failed to deliver safe water to the citizens, reminding us of a line by English poet Samuel Tylor Coleridge, “Water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink”.With people’s health already compromised, lack of budget to test the drinkability of supplied water is alarming as it may lead to more water-borne diseases. Experts warn that contaminated water also contributes to cholera, dysentery, typhoid and hepatitis A and E. Budgetary constraints have affected health agencies primarily responsible for regular drinking water testing. For the upcoming fiscal year, the government has set aside Rs86.24 billion for the health sector, a 2.5 percent increase from the Rs83.99 billion this year. However, the sector’s total share in the budget is only 4.6 percent, leaving us wondering if the amount will cover issues like water safety programmes. The government’s efforts to supply safe water from public networks have been highly unsatisfactory. The Melamchi Drinking Water Project’s inconsistent distribution has disappointed people, and the leaks in the project’s pipes have only resulted in further contamination. Given this, jarred and bottled water are widely used in schools, offices, households and public spaces. However, most of these water sources remain unchecked due to the country’s poor monitoring facilities and human resources. As responsible for unsafe water is the general public, having polluted water sources with faeces, sewage, harmful chemicals, pollutants and other wastes.

Yet, our policies often overlook human-induced water safety concerns. Water contamination usually makes headlines before and during the monsoon, leaving us unaware of their status in other seasons. The government should immediately allocate more inspectors to test water sources and develop plans at local levels for year-round monitoring. Once the water jars and bottles are found unsuitable for drinking, they are sent back to their respective companies, but there’s no guarantee that these companies will later ensure water safety. Sensitising water suppliers on the public’s health and training them to follow the National Drinking Water Quality Standard, which includes water sampling and testing and physic-chemical and microbiological testing, is of paramount importance. The standard also mandates the suppliers conduct quality monitoring, which should be diligently followed. Safe drinking water is a fundamental right; the authorities are duty-bound to fulfil that. This, however, doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do anything at our end to protect our own health. According to the World Health Organization, diarrhoeal cases take a toll on around half a million low- and middle-income countries, with most deaths occurring in children under five. This suggests that simple preventive measures at home can also protect us from deadly diseases. For this, the government and health authorities should make people aware of proper water treatment methods and safe storage. Only serious steps in water security will ensure the government meets its pledge to ensure safe water access for everyone by 2030.

This, however, doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do anything at our end to protect our own health. According to the World Health Organization, diarrhoeal cases take a toll on around half a million low- and middle-income countries, with most deaths occurring in children under five. This suggests that simple preventive measures at home can also protect us from deadly diseases. For this, the government and health authorities should make people aware of proper water treatment methods and safe storage. Only serious steps in water security will ensure the government meets its pledge to ensure safe water access for everyone by 2030.

The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement.

During her four-day visit, she interacted with people from all walks of life, including the prime minister, in an attempt to gauge the human rights situation here. In this interview with Binod Ghimire of the Post, Callamard talked about the human rights situation in Nepal and the rest of the world. Excerpts: You have been travelling this part of the world, interacting with people. How do you evaluate the human rights situation here?Human rights are backsliding everywhere. It’s a global phenomenon. There is backsliding on civil and political rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is backsliding on women’s rights and non-discrimination on economic rights, and in terms of armed conflicts. The number of people dying in armed conflicts is increasing exponentially. We are in deep trouble as far as human rights protection is concerned. The South Asia region hasn’t been immune to the global trend.For my mission, I am visiting Sri Lanka and Nepal. In the two countries, we observe the shrinking of civic space and greater weaponisation of laws to curtail freedom of expression, particularly online. The digital laws are often overbroad and disproportionate. Banning TikTok in Nepal, for instance, is a disproportionate overbroad measure of the violation of international laws. We are observing a great deal of attacks in protests. The use of lethal force or disproportionate use of force by the police in response to even peaceful protests is increasing. There are incidents where protestors have died after the use of police force. There are issues of impunity for past crimes. A study by a European research centre shows that fewer people live in democracies worldwide in 2024 than in 1986. This is a complete U-turn. What do you see as the reasons for the backsliding? There are several factors that explain the backsliding. One could be growing restlessness and anxiety due to economic downturns. There was a severe financial crisis in 2008, and we didn't really recover from it. The inequalities within states and between states have increased in the last decade. We have seen a sharp increase in the wealth of the super-rich. On the other hand, the poor are getting poorer. This is feeding anger and creating fertile ground for populism. The authoritarian leaders are feeding on that particular ground. The backsliding is also linked to Covid that had a terrible impact on the economy and society. During Covid, the governments adopted different emergency measures but, in many cases, those measures were never lifted. In Europe, refugees, migrants and minorities are viewed as the reasons why the economy is not picking up and they are accused of stealing jobs. In every country, the minorities have been made the scapegoats. There is a resentment that democracy has not delivered for the people. The expectations are high, but the governments have failed to act accordingly. Therefore, the people are prepared to listen to the authoritarian leaders. By authoritarian leaders, I do not mean those who are in power by force but those who are democratically elected. They are elected by the people, but they practise authoritarianism once they get into power. In Nepal, the burning problem of authoritarianism has been reflected even in local politics. For instance, the mayor of Kathmandu has resorted to repeated attacks against street vendors and landless people. These are authoritarian moves. Such leaders target vulnerable groups who cannot protect themselves. You are in Nepal at a time the government has arrested the owner of the largest media house. How does Amnesty International look at this situation?We are very alarmed and upset. We call on the government to release him immediately. Even if the charges are valid, they certainly do not justify imprisoning him. Amnesty International believes that the use of those charges is politically motivated and is an attempt to stifle dissent. It is a response to the professional investigation and reporting about the policies and practices of those in power. This is an attempt to silence him, to silence the news media and to silence journalists. By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights.We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority.Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated?Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected.We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology.Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesn’t stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Do you think other countries should follow the European Union’s footsteps?Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings.Why do you think Nepal’s transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward?Sadly, the transitional justice process hasn’t progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. That’s the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice.You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutors’ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire. This is nonsense.Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. In fact, peace is not sustainable without justice. When justice is not delivered, the conflict is bound to recur. It is just a matter of time. We often hear the excuse that if a particular leader or a person is prosecuted, that would affect peace. On the contrary, not investigating the perpetrator is a real challenge to peace. Many people who are in power after a peace deal themselves are guilty of war crimes. They don’t want to be held accountable. It is not in their interest to deliver transitional justice. It takes an incredible, highly moral and principled leadership to take the process ahead.We have seen here that the transitional justice process has been paralysed. Successive governments have failed to act on the Comprehensive Peace Accord. They haven’t acted on what the Supreme Court told them in 2015. It had directed them to review, revise and reform the Transitional Justice Act.Here I have seen the categorisation of crimes as serious and non-serious, which is very strange. It is shocking to me that some killings are considered non-serious, and could lead to de facto amnesty for those responsible for them, even though these crimes fall under international law. If someone was killed after torture then two crimes have been committed—torture and killing. Right to life is the most important right. The investigation should be done accordingly. The same is the case with sexual violence with rape and without rape.What is alarming is that people are losing trust. If people do not trust the systems that are supposed to deliver justice, that will cause a big problem. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons couldn’t undertake proper investigation and prosecution. Not all have received the government’s relief, which has led to much frustration and animosity. There is political interference on transitional justice, which also lacks independence and transparency.We are calling on the authorities to act as directed by the Supreme Court, ratify the statute on the International Criminal Court as well as the International Convention on Disappearance. Do you see chances of international interference if Nepal continues to delay justice delivery?There is no doubt that some crimes committed during the war fall within universal jurisdiction. If the perpetrators of those crimes travel to countries where a framework of universal jurisdiction has been enacted, they could be arrested there. We are seeing the multiplication of universal jurisdiction cases in Europe.Cases of custodial deaths, torture and extrajudicial killings are common in Nepal. How can they be checked?Different organisations like Amnesty International should be monitoring the abuse of power by the police and state authorities. There must be impartial and fair investigation of such incidents. But there is a regime of impunity. The police are not very keen to investigate themselves. I wanted to mention the case of Ajit Mijar, which is an example of justice being denied. It also shows the complicity of the institution in denying justice.Nepal is ranked the fourth most vulnerable country due to climate change though it contributes negligibly in greenhouse gas emissions. The largest polluters haven't fulfilled their responsibilities towards Nepal. How can organisations like Amnesty advocate for countries like Nepal?Amnesty International has long been advocating for climate justice. We have a set of demands. We are advocating at the United Nations level and also at the COP. We are pushing through COP our message of loss and damage, about the responsibilities of industrialised countries to cut their reliance on fossil fuel industries and so on. The impact of global warming will lead to loss of lives in places like Nepal and Pacific Islands.We saw very timid steps taken in COP in UAE last year. These steps are far from sufficient. We see countries multiplying their investments in fossil fuel while big fossil fuel companies are also violating their written commitment to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. This is alarming.However, we have made some progress on loss and damage. Governments are recognising the principle of loss and damage for the countries that are least responsible for climate change. They can rely on some kind of global financial system to protect and support them in case of a sudden climate related crisis. We are now advocating for the responsible countries to set aside the necessary funds.Nepal is at the receiving end of climate change though the country is not responsible for it. However, the Nepali government also has a responsibility towards its people. The extreme weather risk faced by Nepal demands urgent acts from the authorities. The most vulnerable communities are at particular risk. The government must have instruments to protect them.  ","summary":"Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard was in Nepal last week as a part of her first South Asian tour. During her four-day visit, she interacted with people from all walks of life, including the prime minister, in an attempt to gauge the human rights situation here. In this interview with Binod Ghimire of the Post, Callamard talked about the human rights situation in Nepal and the rest of the world. Excerpts: You have been travelling this part of the world, interacting with people. How do you evaluate the human rights situation here?Human rights are backsliding everywhere. It’s a global phenomenon. There is backsliding on civil and political rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is backsliding on women’s rights and non-discrimination on economic rights, and in terms of armed conflicts. The number of people dying in armed conflicts is increasing exponentially. We are in deep trouble as far as human rights protection is concerned. The South Asia region hasn’t been immune to the global trend.For my mission, I am visiting Sri Lanka and Nepal. In the two countries, we observe the shrinking of civic space and greater weaponisation of laws to curtail freedom of expression, particularly online. The digital laws are often overbroad and disproportionate. Banning TikTok in Nepal, for instance, is a disproportionate overbroad measure of the violation of international laws. We are observing a great deal of attacks in protests. The use of lethal force or disproportionate use of force by the police in response to even peaceful protests is increasing. There are incidents where protestors have died after the use of police force. There are issues of impunity for past crimes. A study by a European research centre shows that fewer people live in democracies worldwide in 2024 than in 1986. This is a complete U-turn. What do you see as the reasons for the backsliding? There are several factors that explain the backsliding. One could be growing restlessness and anxiety due to economic downturns. There was a severe financial crisis in 2008, and we didn't really recover from it. The inequalities within states and between states have increased in the last decade. We have seen a sharp increase in the wealth of the super-rich. On the other hand, the poor are getting poorer. This is feeding anger and creating fertile ground for populism. The authoritarian leaders are feeding on that particular ground. The backsliding is also linked to Covid that had a terrible impact on the economy and society. During Covid, the governments adopted different emergency measures but, in many cases, those measures were never lifted. In Europe, refugees, migrants and minorities are viewed as the reasons why the economy is not picking up and they are accused of stealing jobs. In every country, the minorities have been made the scapegoats. There is a resentment that democracy has not delivered for the people. The expectations are high, but the governments have failed to act accordingly. Therefore, the people are prepared to listen to the authoritarian leaders. By authoritarian leaders, I do not mean those who are in power by force but those who are democratically elected. They are elected by the people, but they practise authoritarianism once they get into power. In Nepal, the burning problem of authoritarianism has been reflected even in local politics. For instance, the mayor of Kathmandu has resorted to repeated attacks against street vendors and landless people. These are authoritarian moves. Such leaders target vulnerable groups who cannot protect themselves. You are in Nepal at a time the government has arrested the owner of the largest media house. How does Amnesty International look at this situation?We are very alarmed and upset. We call on the government to release him immediately. Even if the charges are valid, they certainly do not justify imprisoning him. Amnesty International believes that the use of those charges is politically motivated and is an attempt to stifle dissent. It is a response to the professional investigation and reporting about the policies and practices of those in power. This is an attempt to silence him, to silence the news media and to silence journalists. By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights.We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority.Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated?Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected.We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology.Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesn’t stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Do you think other countries should follow the European Union’s footsteps?Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings.Why do you think Nepal’s transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward?Sadly, the transitional justice process hasn’t progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. That’s the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice.You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutors’ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire. This is nonsense.Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. In fact, peace is not sustainable without justice. When justice is not delivered, the conflict is bound to recur. It is just a matter of time. We often hear the excuse that if a particular leader or a person is prosecuted, that would affect peace. On the contrary, not investigating the perpetrator is a real challenge to peace. Many people who are in power after a peace deal themselves are guilty of war crimes. They don’t want to be held accountable. It is not in their interest to deliver transitional justice. It takes an incredible, highly moral and principled leadership to take the process ahead.We have seen here that the transitional justice process has been paralysed. Successive governments have failed to act on the Comprehensive Peace Accord. They haven’t acted on what the Supreme Court told them in 2015.

The party has done poorly in all elections since its establishment. It has also failed in service delivery despite continuously being in the government since its inception. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal caught up with the party’s General Secretary, Ghanashyam Bhusal, for insights about the Unified Socialist’s upcoming general convention and broader political dynamics. Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer?Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation. After Oli’s election as the party leader, policy issues were undermined. In fact, we were at odds because of the policy issues.What were those policy disputes?We [our faction] believed that after the establishment of democratic republic system, the fight for a political system was almost over as this is the most progressive political system of our time. We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party. The new party was confused about the way forward. The upcoming general convention will formulate clear policies in this connection. What about the leadership? Will the party get new leadership?For the past two decades, I have been advocating that a communist party should adopt the right programmes to bring about social changes. At the time, the Maoists had a policy of seizing state power through force, and the UML was talking only about transforming society through elections. But the UML was basically engaged only in winning elections. In this context, we [a group of UML leaders] came up with some policies that would make substantive changes in such ritualistic practices.Now, I have been saying that our party should be led by a leader who can internalise and effectively implement those policies. We have almost finalised the party’s policy documents. When the documents are circulated among party workers, the debate about who is eligible to implement these policies will start.You often claim to be the proponent of the CPN (Unified Socialist)’s party line. If so, will you claim party leadership to implement those policies?The first condition to become the party leader is that he/she should internalise the policies and programmes adopted by the party. I shouldn’t say that no one besides me has internalised them. It is true that I have been actively leading the debates and discussions to introduce new policies in the party. Party representatives will debate and decide this at the convention.A large number of senior leaders quit the UML to form this party. But it couldn’t even retain its members let alone further expand.There was a need for radical reforms and restructuring in communist organisations and their policies. This should have been done by the country’s largest communist party—the CPN-UML. But the party leadership and its rank and file didn’t realise the need for it. There was no serious policy discussion in the UML. While the leadership of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and its organisation are oriented in the right direction, it’s not properly trained for such restructuring. Therefore, many even accused the party leadership of being just a follower and subservient to the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre. Various sections of society who had praised us for standing against Oli’s wrong decision didn’t appreciate other political moves of our party. Parliament dissolution was a political event. A party needs clear programmes and agenda to keep public support. Unfortunately, we were found wanting in this regard. We should have done something in job creation and increasing production. We will make such things clear at the upcoming convention. Since its formation, the party has been constantly bickered over power sharing with other parties and even party leaders always seem to be wrangling for ministerial berths. Don’t you think such activities weaken the party?This happened as the party lacked clear policies to move ahead. Standing against Oli became sort of its policy as there was deep resentment against him. As far as the leaders’ attachment to power is concerned, the party was born out of power [from Parliament, not from the ground]. So the struggle for power is linked to its genesis. It has been in power ever since its establishment. These allegations were hence natural, and the party leadership couldn’t clarify things. We couldn’t show what we did for the betterment of the society.Party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and other top leader Jhalanath Khanal seem to be working at cross-purposes. Nepal seems closer to the Congress while Khanal has been consistently lobbying for an alliance with the UML and the Maoist Centre.We have almost resolved this issue in the course of finalising the party’s policy document. Our conclusion is that, in general, the Congress mainly represents neoliberals and comprador capitalists. When we lobby for the country’s independent economic policy, the Congress may not agree. The party tilts more towards pro-western ideas in the name of liberalism. We in our party are in consensus that in the long-run we will compete against the Congress. But we shouldn’t forget that we got the current democratic system and the constitution only after fighting jointly with the Congress. So we have to keep our doors open for collaboration with the Congress in order to safeguard this system and the constitution. It is also historically proven that the Congress and left forces should stand together to safeguard democratic system. Thus we have now made our theoretical standing clearer.But in practical aspects, as you said, there are some differences. Party chair doesn’t want to increase distance with the Congress as he worked closely with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and other leaders to fight Oli ji. But Jhalanath Khanal ji is for left alliance.While there are already major communist forces such as the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, why is one more communist force, CPN (Unified Socialist), needed? How do you prove your relevance?The CPN-UML didn’t follow the right policies, even those endorsed by its general conventions. Party chief Oli wants total control of the party organisation, from the centre to the local units. The entire party is mobilised mainly to realise Oli’s personal ambitions. This party can’t work in favour of the society in the long run. The Maoist Centre hasn’t succeeded in transforming itself from war-era rigidity of Maoism. The Unified Socialist is here to correct these two major deviations of Nepal’s communist movement. Had the party raised this issue prominently right since its formation, people would have understood its relevance. We will do it now. This convention will be a landmark event in this connection as well. Many people think that the Unified Socialist will ultimately merge with the UML.Merger is not a solution. Even if you want to bring two parties together, you have to unify them. A merger brings top leaders together based on power sharing, just like the merger of the UML and Maoist Centre in 2018. Such a merger is guided mainly by the interests of certain leaders. That’s why the merger didn’t last. The need now is unification among communist parties based on policies and programmes. Otherwise, it will be nothing more than a gathering of leaders. There is no point in merging the party to make the UML bigger and make Oli prime minister one more time.As a leader of a ruling coalition partner, how confident are you of the stability of this alliance?Given the composition of the present Parliament, we can’t rule out the making and breaking of different coalitions until the next election. Oli ji used to talk of the Unified Socialist as a tumour removed after a surgery. His mindset that he can do anything in Nepali politics has suffered a setback. Therefore, he became ready for this coalition. If he has realised this change, this coalition will last. But if he again tries to manoeuvre to justify his dissolution of Parliament and serve any other interests, there might even be other coalitions.Why has your party been in a state of disharmony with coalition partners right from the beginning?Initially, the prime minister didn’t consult with us while making this coalition. That created misunderstanding. He eventually admitted his mistake in failing to inform us on time and sought our support. So, that chapter was closed.

Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   ","summary":"United Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal Hanaa Singer-Hamdy has worked for close to 30 years across development and humanitarian contexts in senior management and strategic leadership roles.

You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit.

The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved?

Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   "},{"hash":"b8cf800b128e5429effac6538b5cdeff14e12e5c92d4968c239f48ce105eb283","title":"interview-with-padam-giri","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/05/05/interview-with-padam-giri","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/padamgiri-1714923097.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1714867200000,"source":"kp","category":"interviews","content":"The budget session of the federal parliament starts Friday without the resolution of the long-standing differences between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate alleged cooperative fraud charges against Rabi Lamichhane, deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs. While several bills await parliamentary approval, whether the House will function smoothly is still uncertain. The Post’s Binod Ghimire sat down with Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, to discuss the government’s plan to make the House productive and its effort to get crucial bills endorsed in the upcoming session. He is also a CPN-UML central committee member. Excerpts:The new session is starting without resolving the old deadlock. How will you ensure its smooth functioning?The Nepali Congress should revisit its demand for the formation of a parliamentary committee targeting a particular person. This is not natural. What are the problems facing the cooperative sector as a whole, which types of fraudulent acts have taken place and who is involved in those cases, however, can be studied. We can constitute a parliamentary committee or other types of panels for such study, which can even recommend actions against those involved in fraud. Why should the main opposition shy away from a detailed study of the entire cooperative sector and want to focus on a particular case and a particular person? I am hopeful the Congress being a responsible democratic party will agree on forming a panel with a broader mandate.The prime minister on Saturday said a probe committee can be formed. What kind of committee is he talking about?He is talking about a committee to study the malpractices prevalent in the cooperative sector, to identify the problems, suggest their solutions while also recommending actions against those involved in fraudulent activities. The main intent behind demanding a probe against a particular person is that once a committee is formed, the party [the Congress] will ask for his resignation. It is an ill-intended demand aimed at creating problems. Media have reported problems in several cooperatives. Would it be feasible to form separate probe committees for each incident? We are in continuous informal discussions with the main opposition and there are plans to discuss the matter formally in an all-party meeting to be held very soon.How will the budget get endorsed if Congress continues to obstruct the House in case the probe panel is not formed as per its demand?Why just probe the home minister and the cooperative where he is allegedly involved? Why not investigate the cooperatives where the leaders from the Congress or any other party might also be involved? We are hopeful that the Congress will analyse whether its demand is rational. I cannot believe it will block budget endorsement.Have you identified why the federal parliament has become so unproductive in terms of bill endorsement?The performance of the parliament is not satisfactory. Getting the bills endorsed as quickly as possible has been my priority ever since taking charge of the ministry. Three bills have been endorsed after I became the minister just two months back. Before that, only one bill had gotten through the parliament in more than one year since the present House of Representatives came into being. That was a matter of shame. Despite the UML then being the opposition party, we had raised the issue in the parliament. It is the government’s responsibility to facilitate the deliberations over the bill and their endorsement. As a law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister, it is my major responsibility to make sure the House sessions are fruitful. I am working accordingly.There are 24 bills under consideration in the federal parliament including 23 under the lower house. I am taking initiatives to get them endorsed in the forthcoming session. The amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TJ) Act, school education bill, bill to amend some Nepal Acts, amendment bill to the Banking Office and Punishment Act, among others, are our top priorities.In January your ministry had identified 109 bills that needed to be presented and endorsed. But only two of them have been registered in the parliament. Why?Our ministry has already consented to different ministries to draft 23 bills. The ministry itself is working on eight more. Several of those bills will be registered in the upcoming session.There are complaints that the bill drafting process is not consultative, which is why many of them are controversial. What is obstructing such broad discussions?I agree that the bills drafted after broad discussions are less contentious. The respective ministries should ensure maximum engagement in the drafting process. If the current bills are drafted without proper consultation, there is room to accommodate diverse voices while they are discussed in the House committees. It won’t be possible to take discussions over all the bills to the public. However, some bills that are closely tied to public concerns need to be discussed at the provincial level or even at the local level, if possible. I also have realised the necessity of broader consultation and commit to it in the days to come.Let’s come to an amendment bill on the Transitional Justice Act. What is stopping the bill from being finalised?The Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the parliament has resolved most contentious issues after long discussions. We are close to finding meeting points on some disputed issues. We continue to engage in formal and informal discussions among the parties, with a plan to endorse it from the upcoming session. The Congress, when in government, didn’t have any differences over the bill. Rather our party had some concerns, which we are trying to sort out.I don’t think it suits the Congress to change its position after being sent to the opposition. People are closely following the position of the different parties on the bill.Listing murder as a serious violation and reduced sentencing are visibly the most contentious issues on the bill. What is the meeting point on these issues?Our party’s [the UML’s] position is clear. All killings of the disarmed people other than in the clashes are serious violations of human rights. All the parties have a common view over reduced sentencing but there are differences over its modality.We must be mindful that our transitional justice process delivers justice to the victims. The process cannot move ahead amid reservations from the victims. It is meaningless to push ahead with a process that is not acceptable to concerned stakeholders including the international community.The discussions among the parties are largely focused on these issues. From next week, the House committee will resume deliberations.A committee to recommend the names of the office bearers in two transitional justice commissions has been formed amid reservations from different quarters. Will it still recommend the names or wait until the bill is endorsed?Let us not forget that the committee was formed in line with a time-bound Supreme Court verdict. How can we ignore the court’s order? A bill doesn’t get endorsed in the government’s interest. It is a prerogative of the sovereign parliament. Demanding a halt to the formation of the recommendation committee when the court has already given its verdict is not a responsible act.I have come to know that the National Human Rights Commission hasn’t sent its representative to the committee, which is wrong. Being a responsible constitutional body it can’t baulk at implementing the court's order. It should send its representative. If there are concerns, s/he can present them before the committee.The committee has inducted two retired judges as its members which was the demands of the victims and the other stakeholders. Similarly, there has been an agreement that two members of the five-member commissions will be retired judges. We have tried to abide by the victims’ concerns as much as we can. When will the Supreme Court get justices in vacant positions?Three positions are already vacant and the fourth will be vacant in a matter of a month or so. Justices for all four positions will be selected in a week or two.Voices are growing mainly from the Congress to amend the constitution to revisit the electoral system. What is your opinion?There has been no discussion on changing the electoral modality. Yes, there is a growing concern that we should find a way to ensure greater stability. We need to discuss how.Is there any possibility of the UML and Congress coming together to form a government?This is now a closed chapter. The two parties had tried to find out possibilities for a tie-up when the present coalition was not even formed. Now there are no such discussions, formally or informally. ","summary":"The budget session of the federal parliament starts Friday without the resolution of the long-standing differences between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate alleged cooperative fraud charges against Rabi Lamichhane, deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs. While several bills await parliamentary approval, whether the House will function smoothly is still uncertain. The Post’s Binod Ghimire sat down with Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, to discuss the government’s plan to make the House productive and its effort to get crucial bills endorsed in the upcoming session. He is also a CPN-UML central committee member. Excerpts:The new session is starting without resolving the old deadlock. How will you ensure its smooth functioning?The Nepali Congress should revisit its demand for the formation of a parliamentary committee targeting a particular person. This is not natural. What are the problems facing the cooperative sector as a whole, which types of fraudulent acts have taken place and who is involved in those cases, however, can be studied. We can constitute a parliamentary committee or other types of panels for such study, which can even recommend actions against those involved in fraud. Why should the main opposition shy away from a detailed study of the entire cooperative sector and want to focus on a particular case and a particular person? I am hopeful the Congress being a responsible democratic party will agree on forming a panel with a broader mandate.The prime minister on Saturday said a probe committee can be formed. What kind of committee is he talking about?He is talking about a committee to study the malpractices prevalent in the cooperative sector, to identify the problems, suggest their solutions while also recommending actions against those involved in fraudulent activities. The main intent behind demanding a probe against a particular person is that once a committee is formed, the party [the Congress] will ask for his resignation. It is an ill-intended demand aimed at creating problems. Media have reported problems in several cooperatives. Would it be feasible to form separate probe committees for each incident? We are in continuous informal discussions with the main opposition and there are plans to discuss the matter formally in an all-party meeting to be held very soon.How will the budget get endorsed if Congress continues to obstruct the House in case the probe panel is not formed as per its demand?Why just probe the home minister and the cooperative where he is allegedly involved? Why not investigate the cooperatives where the leaders from the Congress or any other party might also be involved? We are hopeful that the Congress will analyse whether its demand is rational. I cannot believe it will block budget endorsement.Have you identified why the federal parliament has become so unproductive in terms of bill endorsement?The performance of the parliament is not satisfactory. Getting the bills endorsed as quickly as possible has been my priority ever since taking charge of the ministry. Three bills have been endorsed after I became the minister just two months back. Before that, only one bill had gotten through the parliament in more than one year since the present House of Representatives came into being. That was a matter of shame. Despite the UML then being the opposition party, we had raised the issue in the parliament. It is the government’s responsibility to facilitate the deliberations over the bill and their endorsement. As a law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister, it is my major responsibility to make sure the House sessions are fruitful. I am working accordingly.There are 24 bills under consideration in the federal parliament including 23 under the lower house. I am taking initiatives to get them endorsed in the forthcoming session.

Japan desperately needs foreign workers due to the shortage of a domestic labour force. Therefore, it is in the interest of both countries to make sure that Nepali people who passed the examination for SSW can find a job smoothly and travel to Japan without excessive financial burden. However, in a recent article, there seem to be some crucial misunderstandings and confusions about the Memorandum of Cooperation Japan and Nepal concluded in 2019, which we fear may complicate the smooth implementation of our agreement (‘Third party involvement in Japan job programme contradicts agreement’, December 21, 2020). The embassy would like to clarify the following.The article mentions, ‘The agreement says that recruitment is to be carried out under a government-to-government (G2G) modality’. This is not true. The Memorandum does not provide any government-to-government procedure for sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal. The contract of employment will be signed by the Nepali workers and their employers in Japan. The Government of Japan doesn’t interfere in the private labour market. On the other hand, the Government of Nepal wants to put the implementation of the employment process under its control by issuing permission to Nepali workers wishing to work in Japan. It rather should be called ‘government-to-business modality (G2B)’. Maybe this misunderstanding derives from the fact that Nepal has concluded migrant worker agreements with other countries only under the G2G modality and has not used the G2B modality.Since last October, 207 Nepalis passed the Japanese language test for care workers and 234 Nepalis passed the technical test for care workers. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to find a job so far. It is desirable they make their own effort to find a job in the Japanese labour market. The article further mentions, ‘both countries had strictly ruled out the role of any third party agencies while hiring and supplying workers to Japan’. This is also untrue. The MOC does not have any paragraph stating to exclude the operation of private recruiting agencies. Paragraph 4 of the Memorandum states that Japan and Nepal can consult on issues related to corrective measures for improper accepting organisations in Japan, or organisations engaging in support for foreign human resources with the status of residence of specified skilled workers, and for the improper activities of the concerned organisations in Nepal. Therefore, the participation of private organisations in the process of sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal is not prohibited. The intermediary agencies to provide Nepali workers with jobs should be registered in Japan in accordance with Japanese laws.The article referred to the possibility that Nepali workers who wish to work in Japan may have to pay for airfare, insurance and medical examination. Since Japan is a free economy country, the Government of Japan can’t enforce Japanese companies to pay these costs for Nepali workers. In practice, most Japanese companies cover these costs in employment contracts, but it depends on the individual contract.The article further stated that ‘Nepal is the only South Asian country from where Japan would be hiring workers for 14 industrial sectors’. Actually, Japan also signed similar agreements with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after Nepal.We hope that this information is helpful for Nepali people to better understand the agreement between the two countries and that those who passed the examination will be able to find a job and go to Japan as soon as possible.The Embassy of Japan in Nepal ","summary":"We understand that many Nepalis look for an opportunity to work in Japan, and their expectations are very high, as Japan opened up its labour market for Nepalis as specified skilled workers (SSW) and a direct flight between Nepal and Japan was opened in 2019.

Here, I’m not only addressing the horrendous issue of Chhaupadi itself but also speaking of those women and girls who fall prey to this absurd menstrual practice.Ever thought what travelling back in time would feel like? Many in Nepal do not have to imagine, as such old and evil practises continue to occur in the 21st century!Chhaupadi is a flawed tradition connected to the taboo surrounding menstruation that prohibits Hindu menstruators from participating in normal family activities while on their period, as they are considered impure. Although it is said to be practised in the rural part of the country, it does exist in urban areas, too. Going back to its roots, we could perhaps rationalise that women were asked to stay cautious when menstruating because humans were closely surrounded by wildlife. The stench of blood during their period may have made them more vulnerable to attacks from these animals. But even this absurd line of thought doesn't make much sense anymore. The practise was made illegal in 2005, but cases related to it were reported as recent as 2019. News headlines vouched for fatalities on this account. But why are there such trivial punishments for such an offence? Shouldn’t the punishments be rethought to strongly discourage Chhaupadi altogether?Moreover, the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The more you look into it, there are bound to be cases that have gone unreported because nothing immediately tragic occurred. This letter is a call for all of us to come together to fight this social plague. While the legal implications of such an offence are ambiguous, let's collectively decide that the societal implications of it will be grave.

Here, I’m not only addressing the horrendous issue of Chhaupadi itself but also speaking of those women and girls who fall prey to this absurd menstrual practice.Ever thought what travelling back in time would feel like? Many in Nepal do not have to imagine, as such old and evil practises continue to occur in the 21st century!Chhaupadi is a flawed tradition connected to the taboo surrounding menstruation that prohibits Hindu menstruators from participating in normal family activities while on their period, as they are considered impure. Although it is said to be practised in the rural part of the country, it does exist in urban areas, too. Going back to its roots, we could perhaps rationalise that women were asked to stay cautious when menstruating because humans were closely surrounded by wildlife. The stench of blood during their period may have made them more vulnerable to attacks from these animals. But even this absurd line of thought doesn't make much sense anymore. The practise was made illegal in 2005, but cases related to it were reported as recent as 2019. News headlines vouched for fatalities on this account. But why are there such trivial punishments for such an offence? Shouldn’t the punishments be rethought to strongly discourage Chhaupadi altogether?Moreover, the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The more you look into it, there are bound to be cases that have gone unreported because nothing immediately tragic occurred. This letter is a call for all of us to come together to fight this social plague. While the legal implications of such an offence are ambiguous, let's collectively decide that the societal implications of it will be grave. Let's refuse to accept such atrocities for our mothers, sisters and, above all, ourselves.Gauri Tandon, via email "}]
