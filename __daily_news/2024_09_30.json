She also demanded speeding up the construction of the 210-mile Karnali Highway. \n"},{"hash":"3265ff0b7c41afdcb21530a50226e3eada2be1c7f80079ce8fe47be404bdd41e","title":"narayangadh-muglin-road-section-to-remain-closed-during-night","date":1727395200000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/issues/narayangadh-muglin-road-section-to-remain-closed-during-night","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/Narayangadh_Muglin_road1690717012_1024.jpg","category":"issues","content":"\n The Narayangadh-Muglin road section will remain closed during the night time in view of the possible risk posed by incessant rains.As per the directives of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, the road section has been closed during the night due to the possibility of landslides after incessant rain.\nChief of the District Police Office, Bhaveshwor Rimal said the vehicular movement on the road section has been banned for today and tomorrow.\nHe informed the vehicular operation has been banned from 7.00 pm evening to 5.00 am in the morning\nRimal informed that vehicles except the ones used for essential goods and services will be stopped at Anptari towards Narayangadh and Muglin bazaar towards Muglin. \n","summary":"\n The Narayangadh-Muglin road section will remain closed during the night time in view of the possible risk posed by incessant rains.As per the directives of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, the road section has been closed during the night due to the possibility of landslides after incessant rain.\nChief of the District Police Office, Bhaveshwor Rimal said the vehicular movement on the road section has been banned for today and tomorrow.\nHe informed the vehicular operation has been banned from 7.00 pm evening to 5.00 am in the morning\nRimal informed that vehicles except the ones used for essential goods and services will be stopped at Anptari towards Narayangadh and Muglin bazaar towards Muglin. \n"},{"hash":"3b3b79fb84a98a11849228a2f544d74d32d6882f6c23b9c3db9a06549d2d4ae9","title":"naubise-nagdhunga-road-disrupted","date":1727395200000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/issues/naubise-nagdhunga-road-disrupted","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/SankarShrestha_malekhu_11IMG_20240927_WA0015copy1727439123_1024.jpg","category":"issues","content":null,"summary":null},{"hash":"019c67e8e47b1ada40eb18f4da253f5a8132de69cc68dbfd0fc1eebba9dcfb7e","title":"process-for-operation-of-janakpur-ayodhya-railway-service-in-final-stage-transport-minister","date":1727308800000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/issues/process-for-operation-of-janakpur-ayodhya-railway-service-in-final-stage-transport-minister","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/NepalRailway21622636775_12001630826008_12001648555986_1024.jpg","category":"issues","content":"\nMinister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal has said that the process of operation of Janakpur-Ayodhya railway service has reached the final stage and it will commence soon.Organizing a press conference at the Janakpurdham railway station today, he said the Government of Nepal is to introduce various plans for making the Nepal Railway Service up to the mark and a profitable.\n\"The process has been moved ahead for setting up washing centres at various places of the Nepal Railway.

The book named 'The Age of AI and Our Human Future' was co-authored by Henry A. Kissinger, Eric Schmidt and Daniel Huttenlocher.The book brings to light the trepidation associated with the defining topic of the hour, AI; the past technological endeavours and computer engineering to usher us in the present advancement, and the future prospects and potentials. The writers make clarion calls: Ensure human rights in AI development and deployment. \"Created by humans, AI should be overseen by humans,\" they underscore. They are for the prevailing human conscience over AI activities.\nThe book is divided into seven chapters: a) Where We Are, b) How We Got Here: Technology and Human Thought, c) From Turing to Today- and Beyond, d) Global Network Platforms, e) Security and World Order, f) AI and Human Identity, and g) AI and Future. Every chapter succinctly provides related information and evolution that relates to AI.\nThe first chapter 'Where We Are' has a vivid description of the current stage. It finely summarizes the achievements of AI we are enjoying, and concurrent fear and obsession of panacea and doom. \"While the number of individuals capable of creating AI is growing, the ranks of those contemplating this technology's implications for humanity- social, legal, philosophical, spiritual, moral- remain dangerously thin,\" the trio warned. As we gradually outsource AI for almost every aspect we behave with, the utter absence of 'self-awareness' in AI is the point where the human role is urgent. The references to AlphaZero's victory, a spurt of GPT-3, and the discovery of 'halicin' by AI are some significant subjects explained in this chapter.\nThe discovery of 'halicin' was a milestone in medicine made possible by deep learning. \"The AI that discovered halicin has expanded human researchers' concepts both narrow (bacteria eradication, drug delivery) and broad (disease, medicine, health)\", they observed. The discovery will certainly revolutionize these sectors, thereby hugely benefiting human life. AlphaZero had a pivotal role in expanding the human conception of chess, while GPT-3 bewildered humans with previously unfeasible tasks easily doable- translation, editing, content writing, text and pictures, films.\nSimilarly, the second chapter 'How We Got Here' reminds the readers that technological progress and prowess have an adequate background of the society that fosters discourse and debates on emerging issues. \"During the revolutionary era, innovative technology, novel paradigms, and widespread political and social adaptations reinforced one another,\" they argued. It suggests that technological development does not advance piecemeal, but is bolstered by other factors in society. Indeed, the societies that failed or slowed to whet adequate discussions on the social and political fronts did not witness IT progress as compared to the societies that favoured an atmosphere open and free for exchanges of innovative ideas. The Western world's revolutions in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries formed concepts on roles of the human mind and conscience that helped cope with reality, according to them.\nChapter four: 'Global Network Platforms' is another compelling study on the digital networks that have spanned across the world- people stuck to these for many activities. Initially launched to connect the people and foster a borderless society, the network platforms have emerged so mighty that their presence began threatening national and international governance. The adoption of AI by these networks with gradual sophistication is behind the trepidation. With the vast gathering of users' data and customization, the users are lured to glue to these platforms, and victimized by the manipulation and disinformation in many cases. \"As AI becomes increasingly critical to network platforms functioning, it is also becoming, gradually and unobtrusively, a sorter and shaper of reality- and, in effect, an actor on the national and global stage.\" As the writers have suggested and cautioned in this chapter, the subsequent activities of the Meta and X prove their observation.\nThey also bring the references of TikTok ban in different countries, reasoning the breach of users' data and privacy. With references to the perception of the US, China, Europe, India, Russia, and South East Asia towards network platforms, the writers made analyses of the platforms from the geopolitical perspective as well.\n\"In Beijing, Washington, and some European capitals, concern has been expressed (and articulated obliquely elsewhere) about the implications of conducting broad aspects of the national economic and social life of network platforms facilitated by AI designed in other, potentially rival, countries,\" they stated.\nThe chapter: 'Security and World Order' also captivates the readers by showing the security dimension is changing with AI adoption which ultimately affects the world order. In the absence of security, human society cannot function smoothly and in a peaceful manner. The society remains an organized whole once the security is in place. But when security is defined and determined by evolving issues like AI, the society warrants new approaches to cope with and survive in an order. \"The AI era risks complicating the riddles of modern strategy beyond human intention- or perhaps complete human comprehension,\" they mentioned, showing an urgency of taming the use of AI for humankind.\nMoreover, they project and recommend that within some decades, it is essential to secure a balance of power, taking into account the intangibles of cyber conflicts, massive disinformation and characteristic qualities of AI-fueled war.\nIn the chapter 'From Turing to Today- and Beyond', there is a description of the Turing test which is a remarkable topic and moment in the thought experiment. It was however interpreted in both extremes of good and bad. British mathematician Alan Turing's inquiry: 'Can machines think?' emerged in the mid-twentieth century spurred intense debates and research on the human mind and behaviour, and saw additions to arrive at the present age of AI. Turing's article 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence' created a revolution in the interpretation of human thoughts (intelligence) and its potential. The writers meticulously shed light on the chronological development of intelligence since then to the present and beyond. However, the AI could not evolve in a gradual pace. It was an 'AI winter' from the late 1980s to the 1990s. \"For decades, a lack of computing power and sophisticated algorithms slowed the development of all but rudimentary neural networks. Advances in both fields, however, have now liberated AI developers from these restrictions\" (pg 63).\nThe allusion to Rene Descartes and his foundational philosophy of reality and reason make the book further gripping. 'I think therefore I'm' is a quintessential view of Descartes that dominated the Renaissance in the West and paved a way for further development of science and technology. Writers Kissinger, Schmidt and Huttenlocher wonder if reality and reason are hijacked by AI, what would be the future of humanity? What's the meaning of our existence? They cautioned over growing anthropomorphism.\nAI has no creativity\nIrrespective of the sheer disruption and transformation caused by AI, it has no creativity, no common sense, no sentiment, no self-awareness and no reflection of its discovery. It is human for creativity, emotion and conscience. The writers' observation: \"It (AI) does not know what it doesn't know\" speaks volumes and endorses human superiority.\nUnderlining the urgency of a guiding philosophy of AI, the writers make an emphatic recommendation: \"The AI age needs its own Descartes, its own Kant, to explain what is being created and what it will mean for humanity.\" It is stated in the chapter 'AI and the Human Future'.\nThe book written by three colossus persons- Kissinger, now the late Nobel laureate, and defining person of international relations and strategy; Schmidt, once a Silicon Valley egghead; and Huttenlocher, MIT Professor on Computing, undoubtedly prompt the entire world to ruminate on AI. Since the publication of the book in 2021, the AI revolution has been further augmented, forcing the national, regional and international bodies, including the UN, to prepare future policies and strategies to navigate this realm.\nThe text is an essential read for the present generation. It was first published by John Murray, a Hachette UK company. It cost 20 Pounds. \n","summary":"\nThree formidable figures came together to write a book on an epoch-making concern- artificial intelligence (AI).

I would also like to reaffirm Nepal’s full support as you undertake the important responsibilities entrusted to you.\nWe extend our deepest appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis, the outgoing President, for his commendable leadership in successfully guiding the 78th Session of the Assembly.\nOur highest accolades are due to the Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres, for his tireless dedication to reinforcing multilateralism in tackling global challenges.\nI fondly recall your visit to Nepal last year, Mr. Secretary-General, and your message of peace from the sacred birthplace of Gautam Buddha, and the message of climate catastrophe of mountains from the Everest region.\nMr. President,\nThe world is at a watershed moment in history.\nThe contrast between rich and poor, harmony and hatred, and economic development and environmental destruction have never been as stark as they are today.\nBoth people and planet stand on the brink of climate catastrophe.\nGeopolitical rivalries are resurging.\nMilitary expenditures are skyrocketing along with an unabetted arms race.\nThe spectre of nuclear conflict looms larger than ever before.\nOn one hand, our economy remains frail, still grappling with the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, on the other, nationalism and protectionism have re-emerged, even before we have reaped the benefits that liberalisation and globalisation were meant to deliver.\nEven after three hundred years of industrialization and modernization journey, it is deeply troubling that in our so-called civilized world of 21st century, wealth and prosperity are concentrated mostly at the hand of Global North and the poverty and destitution are heavily concentrated in the Global South, particularly in the least developed countries (LDCs).\nTo overcome these travesties, we must demonstrate our leadership that promotes meaningful cooperation and collaboration.\nIt is only through collective will and unified action that we can turn the tide and usher in an era of enduring peace and shared prosperity for all.\nIn this context, the theme of this Session “Leaving No One Behind: Acting Together for the Advancement of Peace, Sustainable Development and Human Dignity for Present and Future Generations,” could not be more timely or relevant.\nWe have reaffirmed our commitment through the ‘Summit of the Future’ to build a safe, just, and sustainable world for both present and future generations.\nThis pledge is embodied in the three pivotal documents we have adopted: Pact of the Future, Declaration on Future Generation, and the Global Digital Compact.\nWe must demonstrate our determination to implement these documents for the wellbeing of present and future generations.\nMr. President,\nAllow me to underline that the principle of ‘Leaving No One Behind’ has long been the cornerstone of Nepal’s approach to development across all sectors.\nThis philosophy is enshrined in our Constitution which upholds the values of democracy by guaranteeing inclusivity, equality, justice, proportional representation, human rights, and social protection for the most vulnerable sections of society.\nI am determined to lead my country with my deep conviction to ‘comprehensive democracy’.\nFor me, comprehensive democracy ensures equal rights, equal access to opportunities, social justice, protects the vulnerable communities, and provides the security and dignity for all individuals.\nDemocracy goes far beyond the right of the people to choose their leaders. It is about leading the people towards prosperity and happiness so that they could feel highest level of dignity.\nAt the international level, sovereign equality and mutual respect constitute the bedrock of comprehensive democracy.\nThese principles are essential for building the frameworks of a just, inclusive, equitable, representative, and accountable global order.\nMr. President,\nAs a nation emerging from conflict, Nepal deeply understands the profound value of peace and political stability.\nSince the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006, Nepal has been firmly focused on completing the peace process at the earliest.\nImmediately after the formation of my government, parliament passed a Transitional Justice bill to settle transitional justice issue once and for all.\nWhile we implement the law, we will uphold victims’ rights, including truth and justice.\nWe will also use reparations and reconciliation to heal the wounds and scars of conflict period. We appreciate support from international community including the UN system in this regard.\nThe present government, formed by the collaboration of our two major political parties, is determined to secure stability while driving economic transformation for the inclusive and equitable prosperity to our people.\nAt this juncture, stability and economic transformation are paramount to us than our periodic competition in elections.\nWe have dedicated ourselves to realizing our national aspiration: ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali.’\nNepal will be graduating from its LDC status by 2026. We are diligently working towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 and aspire to become a developed country by 2043, despite facing significant economic headwinds.\nHowever, our path to achieving the SDGs remains fraught with difficulties. We are confronted with a substantial financial gap of about 24 billion US dollars to attain the 2030 Agenda.\nIn this backdrop, Nepal hosted the IDA 21 replenishment meeting last June, underscoring the crucial need for continued and enhanced support from the International Development Association along with other development partners.\nIn this pursuit, we strongly reiterate our call for enhanced, predictable, and sustained international support.\nMr. President,\nClimate change has emerged as the gravest threat to our planet, people, and prosperity.\nMy own country, Nepal, is particularly hard hit. We stand as one of the most vulnerable nations to climate change and are ranked as the 20th most disaster-prone country in the world.\nOf utmost concern is the alarming rate at which the pristine Himalayas, often referred to as the Third Pole, are losing their vast snow reserves.\nThis loss threatens water availability for billions of people living downstream, extending far beyond the borders of my country.\nNepal has hugely been contributing to the health of our planet through its forests, mountains and rivers.\nYet, despite these efforts, we continue to bear the brunt of climate change. In this context, we call for climate justice.\nOur mountains play a crucial role in regulating the climate and ecosystem of oceans, with their snow-fed rivers flowing down to the oceans.\nNepal’s Himalayas, as a natural climate stabiliser, help maintain a cooling system in a region situated in the hottest zone of the planet between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.\nGiven their significance, it is essential that the mountain agenda should receive due attention in climate negotiations.\nNepal is steadfast in its commitment to the Paris Agreement and aims to achieve net zero target by 2045, five year earlier than global target.\nAs climate change is a global challenge, it demands global action and collaborative efforts to address its widespread and cascading impacts.\nAdequate climate financing including ‘Loss and Damage’ fund is crucial to support climate-resilient measures and infrastructure for adaptation in developing countries not least in LDCs.\nMr. President,\nNepal’s land is blessed with the wisdom of enlightened great sages from both the Hindu and Buddhist faith, particularly the teachings of Gautam Buddha.\nThis profound legacy has shaped our world view to seek global harmony, peace, and security.\nThe values of love, harmony, tolerance, and empathy as espoused by Gautam Buddha, hold even greater relevance today than they did over two thousand five hundred years ago.\nBut, to our deep dismay, the world is increasingly distressed by division, suspicion, hatred, and enmity.\nNepal firmly believes that dialogue and diplomacy are the sole means to resolve conflicts, including in Ukraine and the Middle East. It is through love and compassion that hostility and hatred can be overcome, paving the way for lasting peace.\nOn the issue of Israel-Palestine conflict, we continue to support a two-state solution, where Israel and Palestine coexist peacefully and securely within internationally recognised borders, in line with relevant United Nations resolutions.\nWe must address the worsening humanitarian crises in regions such as Libya, Syria, Sudan, South Sudan, Yemen, and elsewhere.\nIt is vital to uphold the principles of sovereign equality, non-interference as enshrined in the UN Charter to ensure peace and stability. Consequently, we staunchly oppose any form of unilateral intervention or sanctions.\nMr. President,\nDisarmament and non-proliferation issues must be prioritised.\nNepal strongly advocates for the general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction. As the host country to the UN Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, Nepal firmly believes that regional efforts, including the Kathmandu Process, serve to strengthen the global disarmament regime.\nTechnology presents a double-edged sword, especially for the Least Developed Countries.\nIf we harness it, we can make remarkable progress. If we fail, it will leave us further behind. We call for technology transfer to enable us to catch up.\nMr. President,\nNepal has always adhered to a peaceful, independent, balanced, and non-aligned foreign policy, based on the principles of Panchsheel, the UN Charter, international law, and norms of world peace.\nWe conduct our foreign policy with profound belief in ‘Amity with All, Enmity with None.’\nNepal remains committed to further strengthening its close, cordial, and constructive relations with its immediate neighbours and beyond, rooted in the principles of mutual respect, sovereign equality, territorial integrity, non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, and peaceful co-existence.\nAs the largest contributor of troops and police to UN Peace operations, Nepal stands ready to further enhance its contribution to global peace and security.\nNepal believes it is our rightful call for having commensurate representation in the leadership positions, both at the UN headquarters and in the field, reflecting our significant contribution.\nMr. President,\nNepal firmly advocates for the reform of the UN System to make it more effective, democratic, transparent, and accountable.\nWe firmly believe that stronger multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core, is the only path forward to tackle the numerous global crises we face.\nWe echo a call for substantial reform of the global financial system, as aptly described it by Secretary-General Mr. António Guterres as “morally bankrupt.”\nThe voice and representation of countries in special situations including the LDCs, Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs), and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) must be ensured.\nMr. President,\nNepal firmly upholds the belief that all human rights are universal, inalienable, indivisible, interdependent, and interrelated.\nIt is with this conviction that we have become a party to twenty-four international human rights-related conventions and protocols, including seven of the nine core instruments.\nWe are fully committed to promoting gender equality and ensuring equal rights for women. Nepal is making necessary legal arrangements for the full realisation of all human rights for women and girls including their sexual and reproductive health rights.\nProtection of the rights of migrant workers including their safety, security, dignity, and wellbeing, has always remained our priority.\nWe strongly advocate for safe, orderly, and regular migration to ensure that the benefits of migration are shared by all.\nFinally, Mr. President,\nThe world we inhabit is far from being perfect.\nYet, it is not all doom and gloom. We firmly believe that humankind is still capable enough to march ahead without compromising the prosperity and happiness of future generations.\nNone of the global challenges we are facing today have been imposed by aliens. These are our own makings. Our own creations.\nTherefore, it is self-evident that by fostering global understanding, trust and cooperation, we can overcome these problems and challenges.\nA just, inclusive, and equitable world order as well as sustained prosperity are attainable when we collaborate effectively.\nLet me resonate the wisdom of our ancient text, the ‘Maha Upanishad’ from around the sixth century BC, 'Vasudhaiva kutumbakam’: meaning ‘the whole world is one family.’\nWe not only hold this philosophy dearly, but we also act it on our everyday life.\nWith this constant conviction, Nepal is committed to playing its role to secure our shared aspiration of enduring peace, progress, and prosperity while leaving no one behind.\nThank you. \n","summary":"\n The full text of statement delivered by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli at the 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) is as follows:Mr. President,\nYour Excellencies the Heads of State and Government,\nMr. Secretary General,\nDistinguished Delegates,\nLadies and Gentlemen.\nI stand here as a humble representative of thirty million proud Nepali people.\nAt the very outset, allow me to extend my sincere congratulations to you, Mr. President, and distinguished members of the Bureau on your well-deserved elections.

The court has concluded that he created the fake content with malicious intent.Led by Chief Justice Bishowambhar Prasad Shrestha, the nine-member extended full bench including Prakash Man Singh Raut and Sapana Malla Pradhan among others, issued the verdict after putting it on hold for months. The bench has concluded that though Kandel and Dhungana didn’t produce the content, they published it repeatedly without fulfilling a minimum responsibility of the media to verify the content’s authenticity. On April 26, the website published text as well as audio clips claiming that the chairpersons of two leading media houses sat in a meeting with incumbent and former Supreme Court justices and senior advocates to dismiss over 400 corruption cases in the court. An April 21, 2021 court verdict was part of the deal, it had claimed. The court on April 28 had launched a suo moto contempt of court case against the publisher and the editor of the website for publishing defamatory content against one of its justices. Govinda Ghimire, a deputy registrar at the top court, filed the writ petition claiming that “serious, fabricated and misleading audiovisual content published by the website was a malicious attempt to defame the judiciary.” The petition was filed as per Article 128(4) of the Constitution of Nepal, section 17(1) of the Judicial Administration Act and Supreme Court regulations.In case anyone causes obstruction in the dispensation of justice or disregards any order or judgment handed down by it or any of its subordinate courts, the court may, in accordance with the law, initiate proceedings of contempt, says the constitutional provision. Similarly, the Act allows the court to initiate contempt of court proceedings if it finds anything that is posing hurdles to discharging its duties.After a preliminary hearing, a division bench of justices Nahakul Subedi and Tek Prasad Dhungana on April 29 said content published on the website was prima facie a malicious attempt to defame the judiciary, obstruct the judicial proceedings and scandalise the court.The justice named in the media content referring to the April 21, 2021 verdict of the Constitutional Bench was not part of the bench nor did the advocates named have any link with the case. The justices in the preliminary hearing had directed Yubraj Kandel, publisher of the website, and Nabin Dhungana, its editor, to be present at the court with evidence to substantiate their reports and to answer why they shouldn’t be booked for contempt of court.

Numerous roads throughout the nation are severely damaged, and all routes leading to the capital city, Kathmandu, are still blocked, leaving thousands of travellers stranded.The government has mobilised the security personnel from the Nepal Army and Armed Police Force, along with the Nepal Police, but they lack the necessary equipment to efficiently carry out rescue operations.Security personnel are using primitive equipment like rubber boats, ropes, tubes, and shovels for rescue operations, says Dijan Bhattarai, spokesperson of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority under the Home Ministry.“The rescue operation teams are using the equipment for which they are trained,” Bhattarai told the Post. “Rescue teams from all three security agencies are working under the leadership of the chief district officers across the country.” When the Post asked Armed Police Force spokesperson Kumar Neupane whether the equipment used in the rescue operation were sufficient for the Armed Police Force, Neupane said they were using all means at their disposal.“We indeed lack the equipment needed for a large-scale rescue,” Neupane told the Post. “Once the rescue operation is completed, we will have an official meeting to determine what equipment our personnel lack, and then only our office can give feedback on it.”Experts stress that Nepal, despite having trained manpower in security forces, cannot mobilise them for timely rescue. Lack of proper gear means rescuers lack the confidence to tackle hazardous conditions timely.Experts also express concern about the paucity of resources for emergency rescue. They say the country lacks the tools to deal with emergencies like the one that unfolded due to the incessant rain from Thursday night until Saturday. Lack of personal protection equipment for rescuers is a case in point.Amod Mani Dixit, an expert in natural disaster prevention, says that alongside the lack of resources, the government’s indifference is another major reason behind Nepal's poor and ineffective emergency rescue. “The issue of disaster rescue operations doesn’t get proper attention in the legislatures,” he said, “even though Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries to various types of disasters.”Armed Police Force spokesperson Neupane, however, tried to defend the administration's failure. “We could have lost more people had the administration not restricted long-route travel for Friday and Saturday nights,” he said. “Both days witnessed heavy rainfall.”Though Neupane claimed the notice of administration helped to save people’s lives, experts on transportation and traffic professionals differ. For them, the failure of the administration was one of the reasons why many people lost their lives in Jhyaple Khola in Dhading.They say the incident occurred even if the administration had circulated a directive not to operate the long-route travel for two nights as the vehicular movement was not strictly monitored.“Government should have been strict about enforcing its directive,” Ashish Gajurel, an observer on transportation and traffic professionals, told the Post. “The government failed on that front.”Likewise, Gajurel questioned the way the government has conducted its rescue operation. The rescue operation team still uses traditional techniques instead of modern scientific technology, he said. “The rescue operation team is using an excavator to dig out the people buried by the flood,” Gajurel said. “Use of excavators can have unintended consequences as they can kill people who are still alive under the debris.”Gajurel added that instead of using security personnel for rescue operations during natural calamities, it would be better if the government had a trained team with the required equipment for such incidents.Man Thapa, who has worked as a disaster management expert in different countries under the United Nations and other development agencies, also questions the government prepardness to tackle natural disasters.“Nepal’s disaster response mechanism is reactive,” Thapa said. “It is activated only in the aftermath of the disaster.” Thapa added that Nepal neither has a competent enough human resource nor is it well equipped.“These disasters have badly exposed the failure of all tiers of government,” Thapa told the Post. He added that the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) has also failed to prove its role. The authority is tasked with coordinating different government authorities while also transferring knowledge between them.Thapa points out three reasons why natural disasters often result in a large-scale loss of lives and properties in Nepal—lack of coordination among the three tiers of government, lax implementation of the building codes and the nature of the Nepali community that does not take early warning seriously.“In the context of Nepal, linking development with disaster risk reduction is of utmost importance,” he said. “There is a disaster response mechanism at the ward level. The elected representatives at the ward level know the situation of every household.

The fruits and vegetable market in Balkhu has been flooded, while the Kalimati market was partially affected.Traders say that the supply of food and fresh vegetables dropped sharply, particularly from Dhading and Kavre, the key source districts to Kathmandu, as landslides have blocked highways.The lifeline for Kathmandu has been severed since Saturday with the Tribhuvan and Prithvi highways being blocked.The BP Highway linking Kathmandu with eastern Tarai has also been blocked. Kalimati, which houses the country’s largest fruits and vegetables market, received 156 tonnes of vegetables on Saturday, down nearly a fourth from 571 tonnes on Friday.“There is a supply constraint due to landslides in most of the highways connecting Kathmandu. As a result of low supply and high demand, prices of vegetables have increased,” said Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board.“Today [Sunday], we received only 38 tonnes of vegetables till 4:00 pm. These vegetables are from the Valley, produced on tunnel farms.”However, tunnel farming has also been largely affected by the floods. Shrestha said that as soon as the highways are cleared, supply will become normal.The wholesale price of most of the seasonal green vegetables has crossed the Rs100 per kg mark.According to the board's wholesale price index, the big price of tomatoes increased by 29.41 percent to Rs110 per kg, the price of cowpeas jumped by 46.67 percent to Rs110 per kg, the bitter gourd price increased by 69.23 percent to Rs110 per kg, and the smooth gourd price increased by 80 percent to Rs135 per kg.Potato price increased by 7.25 percent to Rs74 per kg. Other vegetables like tomato (local and tunnel), onion, carrot, cabbage, cauli local, French bean, bottle gourd, squash, green leafy vegetables, mushroom, cucumber, green chilli and coriander greens have gone up after the flood and landslide.The vegetable price was already high, and an additional jump amid the nearing festivals has worried consumers.According to a central bank report released last Thursday, the food and beverage inflation stood at 6.17 percent in mid-August compared to the same period last year.Under the food and beverage category, the year-on-year price index of the vegetable sub-category increased 19.07 percent, pulses and legumes 12.09 percent, cereal grains and their products 9.15 percent, and milk products and eggs 3.66 percent.A few wholesalers the Post talked to said that flood impacts on the warehouses have been big, which could increase the prices.Pabitra Bajracharya, president of Nepal Retailers Association, however, said that the retailers have been less affected.“As there is sufficient stock of food items like rice, edible oil, pulses and legumes, I do not think the prices of essential consumable goods will go up,” he said. “However, the opportunist wholesalers may hike the price on the pretext of floods and landslides.”Retailers said that the wholesalers have already hiked the price of edible oil.“I have been selling sunflower oil at Rs210 per litre. Today (Sunday), the distributor quoted Rs222 per litre wholesale. I have to sell the edible oil at Rs240 per litre to consumers,” said Bajracharya. That’s a hike of 15 percent overnight. “Even I am shocked at the new rate,” said Bajracharya.Retailers said there is no reason for the price of rice, pulses, and legumes to rise immediately as the traders have sufficient stock. However, as most of the traders' warehouses in the Kuleshower and Balkhu area were flooded on Saturday, damaging their goods, these traders may recover the losses by passing the burden on to consumers, Bajracharya said.Subodh Kumar Gupta, immediate past president of the Association of Nepalese Rice, Oil and Pulses Industries, said, “We have stocks of rice, edible oil, pulses and legumes for three months in different factories and warehouses outside the Kathmandu valley. In Kathmandu, the stocks may last a month. But the transportation problem is prolonged, and there could be a shortage of food items in Kathmandu Valley.”Consumer rights activists said traders may create artificial shortages to jack up prices in difficult times when the government’s monitoring of the market is poor.“The government’s supply utilities like the Food Management and Trading Company and the Salt Trading [Corporation Limited] have no sufficient stock of food. The government's preparedness to check the market price during a disaster like this has not been up to the mark,” said Madhav Timalsina, president of the Consumer Rights Investigation Forum.He said it is unjustifiable to raise the prices of food, vegetables, and fruits exorbitantly because of the partial flood in the Kuleshwar area and vegetable market.“If traders are seen hiking the prices, they need to be booked immediately.”Even in the past, such as during the border blockade and the Covid-19 period, the government mechanism utterly failed to control the prices. ","summary":"The severe flooding and landslides that Nepal has faced for the last few days have pushed food and vegetable prices up in Kathmandu, as roads connecting the Valley have been obstructed since Saturday.Traders say that delays in opening the highways could push the prices of foods and vegetables further.In the Capital, the record rainfall in 54 years inundated most of the warehouses of essential food items, traders said. The fruits and vegetable market in Balkhu has been flooded, while the Kalimati market was partially affected.Traders say that the supply of food and fresh vegetables dropped sharply, particularly from Dhading and Kavre, the key source districts to Kathmandu, as landslides have blocked highways.The lifeline for Kathmandu has been severed since Saturday with the Tribhuvan and Prithvi highways being blocked.The BP Highway linking Kathmandu with eastern Tarai has also been blocked.

Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. ","summary":"Nepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back.

Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential.

They really don’t do chiya well. Perhaps because they grow so little of it, with only 40 hectares spared for it in the whole of mainland US. Contrast this puny acreage for tea with humongous areas set aside for corn and soybean.The US is the largest corn producer in the world, churning out nearly 400 million metric tons last year. It is also a soybean heavyweight, growing some 114 million tons of the stuff a year. The success of these two products is a testament to the American ingenuity in agricultural innovation and mechanisation. On a recent hot August day, I was on the soybean farm of Kyle Durham in the US state of Missouri. A sixth generation farmer, Durham lives on the farm with his wife Courney and their two sons. Founded by Durham’s grandfather after the Second World War, his farm, which at this time of year was covered in green Soybean plants, stretches over 1,000 hectares.I am curious. “How many people do you employ in the planting and harvesting of soybeans?” I ask the middle-aged soy farmer with a salt and pepper goatee. “I do it all myself,” he says. I can hardly believe my ears. Back in Nepal, I start thinking, it would take at least 20 farm hands to work a field of a similar size. Durham then takes us to his sizable shed to show some of his farm equipment. The soy harvester is as big as a mini-house, capable, we are told, of planting the whole farm in around 10-15 days.“How much does this thing cost?” I ask.“Around 600,000 dollars,” he replies. The planter is of a similar size. Everything here is on an industrial scale.The US is better known as a technological goliath, birthing such world-beating tech giants as Apple and Google. Lesser known are its agriculture exploits. Yet even in agriculture, it is a model of efficiency and endless experimentation.According to the US Department of Agriculture, the total farm output in the country tripled between 1948 and 2021, even as total input use declined. The American farmers and their representative bodies work closely with local research universities to boost yield and discover more weather and pest resistant crop varieties. Even at the risk of comparing chalk and cheese, it is worth nothing that Nepal’s productivity is dismal—even by regional standards. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, between 1960 and 2017, the annual growth rate of rice yield in Nepal was 1.14 percent—substantially less than the corresponding figures for India (2.5 percent), Bangladesh (three percent) and China (4.2 percent). In this time, the global average was 4.5 percent.No wonder Nepal is these days importing even the cereals that it once exported in abundance. Nepal used to export more food than it imported until the early 1980s. But it became a net importer from the early 1980s, and such imports really took wings after 2008.The country is still an agriculture-based economy, the sector engaging over 60 percent of its people. Yet it is also clearly not a government priority. Forget fancy equipment. Our farmers don’t even get timely fertilisers, as a result of which they are having to cut down on paddy acreage. Nepal’s agricultural woes will only get worse with climate change. Indications are that changes in precipitation patterns will affect rainfed agriculture, resulting in annual yield variability and higher production risks.Yet our government continues in its own merry, do-little way, which is why, even as the risks multiply, the implementation of vital agriculture policies remains dismal. Take the National Agricultural Policy 2004, which came to support the Agricultural Perspective Plan, a cross-sectional strategy to make Nepal self-sufficient in food. The policy was brought to boost agriculture-led rural development. To take just one example of its poor implementation, the policy discourages transformation of fertile land for non-agricultural uses, and adoption of more scientific land use. Yet after all these years the conversion of agricultural into non-agricultural land continues unabated. Our politicians and lawmakers didn’t see any political benefit in the policy’s implementation, it seems. Even the champions of the proletariat in Nepal have turned into uber-bourgeois, and there is now no political party that understands farmers. This is self-defeating. As things stand, productive agriculture is Nepal’s best shot at prosperity. But without state support, little will come out of it. The US heavily subsidises its crops and dairy products, partly as a result of the outsized political clout of American farmers. Even in India, there are large subsidies for fertilisers, as well as generous irrigation and crop insurance—not to mention a legion of hidden subsidies. By comparison, in Nepal, things like minimum support prices and input subsidies are as good as non-existent. When other countries, big and small, are offering substantial subsidies to their farmers, why have we failed to protect and promote our own farmers? Why is there such a mismatch between our status as an agricultural country and the reality on the ground? This is no trivial issue. Food insecurity is emerging as a big global challenge. Even Nepal is often affected by India’s sudden bans on export of daily commodities like sugar and grains. Earlier this year, rice prices surged in Nepal after India banned the export of non-basmati white rice. Nepalis, as a result, are having to set aside larger and larger sums from their fixed incomes just to feed themselves. Pretty much the same thing happens with many of the fruits and vegetables. There is no reason Nepali agriculture should be struggling so badly despite the country’s obvious challenges: Besides the ones mentioned above, land fragmentation, difficult terrains, high exodus of youths, and the absence of the economies of scale available to the likes of the US and India. Back home in Nepal, as I finally get to sip on some locally-grown, delectably light white tea, I cannot help but think: In a country where under 2 percent of its people are into agriculture, the American farmers are rich and wield enormous political power. In sharp contrast, in Nepal, where a solid majority of people still rely directly or indirectly on agriculture for their livelihood, the Nepali farmers are poor, and they now have next to no political power that they can use to change their lot.   ","summary":"From Nebraska to New York, the Americans serve a sorry version of tea labelled chai latte—basically spiced up milk and water with a hint of tea.

Judging from the performance of some of the major characters, if not all, we can see the following.The overplayed bravado seems to be the character of some political leaders of the major parties. Though the leaders sound emotional and superbly ideological in their party-related speeches, they are torn between dreams and realities as never before. The sense of futurity and the dream plans for the country of some intelligent political leaders are mired in their narratives of conduct and misguided ambitions. Their intellectual and policy documents are few and far between. Evoking fear, emotion and threat appears to be the common style. However, it would be wrong to conclude that the entire political system and the modus operandi of all the political leaders possess this character.I would like to mention some occasions to enter the subject, which is the changing character of Nepali politics on some important scores. Political scientists and historians have been writing on this. History says Nepali political parties came into existence by choosing certain political ideologies as the guiding principles. The broad division line was between the social democratic principles and communist ideology. The political parties did lay down their programmes and principles regarding the economy’s management, the structure of political organisations, and the nature of the constitution. I remember raising slogans as a school student supporting a political party and repeating its complex economic and political programmes. People from different walks of life repeated the slogans like a mantra. The parties drew from the ideologies propounded by scholars, philosophers and leaders like Karl Marx, Mahatma Gandhi, Mao Zedong and others. We grew with the ideological foregrounding dominating the organisations of the political parties. But later, such ideological foregrounding lost its earlier attraction. The party leaders travel to different parts of the country for what they call consciousness-raising. However, the basic mode of party propaganda and schooling is dominated by oral discourses, rhetorics and interactions, not the teaching of hard-core ideologies. I understand political parties do not prioritise elaborating or explaining the ideological part, since it has lost its original attraction. What we have now is a post-ideological situation, created by the Nepali political parties, especially the communists. This becomes important, if we consider the major transformations and experiments that Nepal’s communists have made in their ideological options.Maoist leader Lokendra Bista Magar ‘Abhyas’ met me at my working table at Himalayan Java Coffee House in Thamel over a decade ago. A huge tome running 800 pages titled Nepali Communist Andolan ra Janakrantika Aitihasik Dastabejharu (2070 BS) or \"The historical documents of the Nepali Communist Movements and People's Revolution\" accompanied him. He wanted me to review the book. I tried to convince him that I was not the right person. However, Bista said, \"We want a non-partisan literary person to review this.\" His remarks struck me, and I decided to write and publish the book review in Kantipur (May 19, 2014). The book begins with the first pamphlet published after the establishment of the Nepal Communist Party on September 15, 1945, and includes documents about the breaking and coming together of different communist groups. Overall, the tome is a vast single self-review of the Nepali communists. The swings in the communist parties are noteworthy. Take the Maoist movement, the party's armed insurgency and the grand peace agreement they signed with the other seven parliamentary parties on November 21, 2006, as examples. The latest big party, organised around the so-called ideology and the name of Mao, did not put a premium on the tremendous production of ideological propaganda. However, as the bibliographies show, there is a massive body of work written about the Maoist movement, and the Maoists separately and systematically elaborated the party's ideology as a project. This is an interesting subject of study. The Maoist armed movement naturally had an impact on Nepali politics. They shunned the path after the agreement. It is significant how the political leaders, especially the communists who have carved out the history of Nepal, find the Bangladesh uprising an eloquent example to evoke fear of disruption and uprising in the country. As a senior responsible leader, this is a natural warning from Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the erstwhile prime minister. However, his other remarks do not give credence to that. Similarly, the CPN-UML, instead of uniting parties on addressing the country’s important issues, has chosen to stoke the fire by rubbing the word himsa or violence that they see as the sole character of the Maoists. But this is a mere semantic luxury to rub on the word himsa and enjoy seeing the Maoist leaders shout in opposition, promising to stall the parliamentary proceedings. Nepali Congress lives on with BP Koirala and his ideals. Koirala did not write great theoretical works; instead, he chose to write great literary works. He saw immense power in the inner dynamics of his characters' psyche; he decided to keep that separate from his politics. Koirala had a clear conscience about political matters. He made a famous declaration that he was an anarchist in literature and a socialist in politics. Other parties come with similar packages of dreams, ideologies, and disillusionments.I was asked to comment on the book launch of Prachanda: The Unknown Revolutionary (2008), written about Dahal by Anirban Roy, a Hindustan Times journalist and published by Mandala Book Point. The event was held at the Himalaya Hotel. The people invited to the dais were the then Chairman of the Constituent Assembly, Subas Chandra Nembang, Dahal’s father, Muktinath Dahal, and me. That was Dahal’s first stint as prime minister, yet he could not attend the programme. Dahal’s father signed a book for me and said, among other things, “Honesty is the greatest strength of a political leader.” Whenever I see the wavy signature of this simple and inspiring farmer, I feel that political leaders are slowly abandoning the path of honesty.

However, it would be wrong to conclude that the entire political system and the modus operandi of all the political leaders possess this character.I would like to mention some occasions to enter the subject, which is the changing character of Nepali politics on some important scores. Political scientists and historians have been writing on this. History says Nepali political parties came into existence by choosing certain political ideologies as the guiding principles. The broad division line was between the social democratic principles and communist ideology. The political parties did lay down their programmes and principles regarding the economy’s management, the structure of political organisations, and the nature of the constitution. I remember raising slogans as a school student supporting a political party and repeating its complex economic and political programmes. People from different walks of life repeated the slogans like a mantra. The parties drew from the ideologies propounded by scholars, philosophers and leaders like Karl Marx, Mahatma Gandhi, Mao Zedong and others. We grew with the ideological foregrounding dominating the organisations of the political parties. But later, such ideological foregrounding lost its earlier attraction. The party leaders travel to different parts of the country for what they call consciousness-raising. However, the basic mode of party propaganda and schooling is dominated by oral discourses, rhetorics and interactions, not the teaching of hard-core ideologies. I understand political parties do not prioritise elaborating or explaining the ideological part, since it has lost its original attraction. What we have now is a post-ideological situation, created by the Nepali political parties, especially the communists. This becomes important, if we consider the major transformations and experiments that Nepal’s communists have made in their ideological options.Maoist leader Lokendra Bista Magar ‘Abhyas’ met me at my working table at Himalayan Java Coffee House in Thamel over a decade ago. A huge tome running 800 pages titled Nepali Communist Andolan ra Janakrantika Aitihasik Dastabejharu (2070 BS) or \"The historical documents of the Nepali Communist Movements and People's Revolution\" accompanied him. He wanted me to review the book. I tried to convince him that I was not the right person. However, Bista said, \"We want a non-partisan literary person to review this.\" His remarks struck me, and I decided to write and publish the book review in Kantipur (May 19, 2014). The book begins with the first pamphlet published after the establishment of the Nepal Communist Party on September 15, 1945, and includes documents about the breaking and coming together of different communist groups. Overall, the tome is a vast single self-review of the Nepali communists. The swings in the communist parties are noteworthy. Take the Maoist movement, the party's armed insurgency and the grand peace agreement they signed with the other seven parliamentary parties on November 21, 2006, as examples. The latest big party, organised around the so-called ideology and the name of Mao, did not put a premium on the tremendous production of ideological propaganda. However, as the bibliographies show, there is a massive body of work written about the Maoist movement, and the Maoists separately and systematically elaborated the party's ideology as a project. This is an interesting subject of study. The Maoist armed movement naturally had an impact on Nepali politics. They shunned the path after the agreement. It is significant how the political leaders, especially the communists who have carved out the history of Nepal, find the Bangladesh uprising an eloquent example to evoke fear of disruption and uprising in the country. As a senior responsible leader, this is a natural warning from Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the erstwhile prime minister. However, his other remarks do not give credence to that. Similarly, the CPN-UML, instead of uniting parties on addressing the country’s important issues, has chosen to stoke the fire by rubbing the word himsa or violence that they see as the sole character of the Maoists. But this is a mere semantic luxury to rub on the word himsa and enjoy seeing the Maoist leaders shout in opposition, promising to stall the parliamentary proceedings. Nepali Congress lives on with BP Koirala and his ideals. Koirala did not write great theoretical works; instead, he chose to write great literary works. He saw immense power in the inner dynamics of his characters' psyche; he decided to keep that separate from his politics. Koirala had a clear conscience about political matters. He made a famous declaration that he was an anarchist in literature and a socialist in politics. Other parties come with similar packages of dreams, ideologies, and disillusionments.I was asked to comment on the book launch of Prachanda: The Unknown Revolutionary (2008), written about Dahal by Anirban Roy, a Hindustan Times journalist and published by Mandala Book Point. The event was held at the Himalaya Hotel. The people invited to the dais were the then Chairman of the Constituent Assembly, Subas Chandra Nembang, Dahal’s father, Muktinath Dahal, and me. That was Dahal’s first stint as prime minister, yet he could not attend the programme. Dahal’s father signed a book for me and said, among other things, “Honesty is the greatest strength of a political leader.” Whenever I see the wavy signature of this simple and inspiring farmer, I feel that political leaders are slowly abandoning the path of honesty.

As an educator who has led the placement cell of a business school for seven consecutive years, I have noticed shifts in the Nepali job market dynamics. Job-hopping behaviour of younger employees, especially Generation Z, born between 1997 and 2012, and millennials, born between 1981 and 1996, is a particular concern for employers. A Gallup study found that Millennials are most likely to switch jobs, with 6 millennials out of 10 open to new opportunities, reflecting their low engagement in the workforce. This is also evident in Nepal, especially in sectors like IT, startups, banking, corporate and development. In today's gig economy, career paths for younger generations significantly differ from those of earlier generations. However, due to the lack of official data and empirical research on job hopping in the country, this piece takes an exploratory approach to understanding the phenomenon.Why do people job-hop?There are various reasons why people change jobs, such as insufficient compensation, lack of career opportunities, limited growth potential, low job satisfaction and dissatisfaction with workplace culture and toxic environment. Common complaints include issues with supervisors' communication styles, lack of mentorship and development, boredom, uninspiring work environment, misalignment with company values, rigid dress codes and ineffective communication channels like social media. Younger generations prefer their supervisors and seniors to use communication channels and platforms that align with their preferences, such as voice messages and images, to convey messages instead of lengthy written content. The younger generation values appealing modern job titles like \"lead\" and avoids workplace cultures that use traditional hierarchical titles such as \"officer\" or \"assistant,\" even for entry-level positions.These generations believe that job-hopping can accelerate career growth. They prioritise work-life balance, favouring flexible hours and remote work opportunities over higher pay. Non-financial benefits, such as two-day weekends and a relaxed office culture, are also attractive to them. Platforms like LinkedIn allow them to share career expectations, which enhances their negotiating power easily. Additionally, headhunting is prevalent, and being approached by recruiters often encourages employees to switch jobs, as it makes them feel valued and offers opportunities for better compensation or promotions. In startups and smaller firms, job security and career stagnation further drive job hopping. Nepali youths may also switch jobs to fit in with social circles, as it is sometimes seen as a trend. Long-term jobs are less appealing to these gig workers, who prefer project-based assignments and dislike hierarchical structures. They seek recognition and value performance metrics over traditional benefits like pensions. As a result, their commitment to long-term employment is often limited. In Nepal, alongside the rise of employees switching jobs domestically, experienced workers in specific sectors prefer to move abroad for better opportunities. Consequences of job hoppingFrom my frequent interactions with younger professionals, it is clear that competitive salaries are a major factor driving job switches, often without considering long-term impact. This can hinder deep skill development, as constantly seeking diverse experiences may result in inconsistent expertise.Employers often perceive frequent job changes as signs of instability, which can harm an employee's reputation. While job hopping can lead to diverse skills, it may not always result in meaningful growth, and those switching for higher positions might experience only superficial progress. Job hopping is resulting in rising employee turnover, which is affecting productivity, increasing recruitment costs and leading to the loss of institutional knowledge.Is job hopping really bad?Many Nepali employers are making concerted efforts to retain top talent by engaging employees through innovative programmes like employee development initiatives. The Employee First, Customer Second (EFCS) approach prioritises employee well-being over customer satisfaction, believing that their happiness can result in better customer service. Organisations offer study opportunities and programmes like in-house Toastmasters, which are fully funded for employees.Although job hopping may seem negative, it does not necessarily harm the economy. Recent research shows that the relationship between how long someone has worked (tenure) and their productivity forms a curve. Analysis of the workforce's tenure suggested that the positive impact of tenure on productivity becomes smaller over time. Hence, longer tenure does not always result in performance enhancement.The concept of Pareto optimality, or Pareto efficiency, is relevant in the labour market, particularly regarding job hopping, where both employees and employers can benefit. When a situation is Pareto optimal, one party cannot improve their situation without negatively impacting someone else. This principle applies to the relationship between employers and employees, especially when job changes benefit both. For employees, job changes often lead to better opportunities, such as improved pay, work-life balance, career growth, or job satisfaction. An employee may find a new position that aligns closely with their values, skills, or career goals, enhancing their situation without harming their previous employer.Employers also gain from job hopping. When an employee leaves, it allows the employer to seek candidates who may be a better fit for the role. For example, if a former employee is disengaged, their departure can lead to hiring someone more aligned with the company's objectives, resulting in a more productive and engaged workforce. This can enhance the labour market's efficiency by matching individuals to roles that suit their skills and motivations. As both parties find better alignments—employers with more capable workers and employees with more fitting roles—the dynamic can lead to a Pareto optimal outcome, optimising human resources without disadvantage. However, not every job change achieves Pareto efficiency. Even in cases where a job move proves advantageous for the employee, employers may bear expenses associated with the recruitment, employment and training of new staff members. This could result in a short-term disadvantage for the company. An employee may occasionally depart with important institutional knowledge that the employer finds difficult to replace, which could put the employer in a worse situation. Nepali employers need to carefully assess the advantages and disadvantages of this growing trend and be better prepared to manage it effectively.

The government said a million people - a fifth of the population - have fled their homes.The intensifying Israeli bombardment over two weeks has killed a string of top Hezbollah officials, including its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.Israel has vowed to keep up the assault and says it wants to make its northern areas secure again for residents who have been forced to flee Hezbollah rocket attacks.Israeli drones hovered over Beirut for much of Sunday, with the loud blasts of new airstrikes echoing around the Lebanese capital. Displaced families spent the night on benches at Zaitunay Bay, a string of restaurants and cafes on Beirut’s waterfront.Many of Israel’s attacks have been carried out in the south of Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Hezbollah has most of its operations, or Beirut’s southern suburbs.Monday’s attack in the Kola district appeared to be the first strike within Beirut’s city limits. Syrians living in southern Lebanon who had fled Israeli bombardment had been sleeping under a bridge in the neighborhood for days, residents of the area said.The United States has urged a diplomatic resolution to the conflict in Lebanon but has also authorised its military to reinforce in the region.U.S. President Joe Biden, asked if an all-out war in the Middle East could be avoided, said “It has to be.” He said he will be talking to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Arriving here just before the 2022 elections, he has since closely observed Nepali politics and society. Umesh Chauhan and Biswas Baral recently sat down with Thompson to reflect on his time in Nepal, major US projects in the country including those under the MCC, geopolitical competition with China, trade, and a range of other issues.How have you seen Nepali politics evolve in the two years you have been in the country? What events stood out? I’ve seen a lot of Nepali politics. Obviously, there’s been a lot of changes. I got here right before the national elections in November 2022. It was really great to see the democratic process play out here, to see Nepalis turn out in such great numbers and make their choices known.Democracy is such a vibrant and colourful exercise anywhere in the world. Nepal did not disappoint on that front. It's been fascinating to watch it evolve, to watch the governments come in different formations.What’s been great is the commitment we’ve seen from successive groups in government to moving forward and carrying forward the [bilateral] partnership and building on projects. I’ve also been amazed at some of the innovative things happening in various sectors of the economy.There has been some very exciting work in the IT sector, for example, that runs the gamut from more traditional back-office type operations to cutting-edge AI research, to developing educational apps for school students, to things like what we have been sponsoring at our Content Creator’s Mela these past two years. It is great to see Nepalis show lots of creativity in expressing themselves and talking about their culture and their society in so many different ways. Across the board, I’d say the experience has been unique.How have the Nepal-US relations evolved over the past 77 years of diplomatic ties? What are the salient features of the relationship? What I would say is we’ve always tried to listen, to engage with the Nepali society. Based on that, I think one of the things that we’ve done is refine the range of products.The Peace Corps, the USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Development Finance Corporation, or other elements of our assistance and development commitments—these are different tools that can be employed. And Nepal has continually expanded its capacity to take advantage of them. The US has been able to increase the number of tools and assets, if you will, that Nepal can use to build its economy.I’m very proud of the fact that we have done this primarily through grant-based assistance, so that there is little in terms of downsides. At the same time, we have focused on different segments of the economy or society, for example, through the Development Finance Corporation, we’re now able to target and work with the financial sector to create more opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly women-run enterprises. Through the USAID, we can use more of the traditional mechanisms of assistance.The Millennium Challenge Corporation kind of speaks for itself. It targets large-scale, massive infrastructure type projects that aim to be transformative in terms of Nepal’s economy. It has helped grow the road and infrastructure network and show new technology that can help expand that network and make roads safer, more reliable, and easier to maintain. It has helped build an electricity infrastructure that allows Nepal, first and foremost, to internally use the green hydropower that's at its disposal, but there will be excess capacity even to export it to the region to earn additional income. So I’m pretty excited about what I’ve seen happen over the past 77 years, and where we are today. I’m also extremely positive about building on where we are now. Can you give us a status of the implementation of projects under the Millennium Challenge Account Nepal? In the MCC, energy, obviously, is a high-priority area and so is transportation. Where we are with the projects themselves is we have let out the contracts for the sub-stations, for the 18-kilometre cross-border transmission line, and we have reissued the tender for the 297-kilometre broader transmission line package that had to be revised due to some cost changes over the time it took to implement that piece of the package.But we’re pretty positive about getting that back on track by the end of the year and putting the project firmly on the right footing for a five-year completion timeline. But there have also been hurdles, right? Do you still expect the transmission lines and road projects to be completed in five years?I expect there to be more hurdles. The biggest challenge was when the bids came back for the 297-kilometre transmission line. We had a number of delays there from Covid to worldwide inflation, to supply chain shifts that I don’t think people had foreseen completely. I’m not surprised. But the MCC has had a lot of experience around the world with these projects.It builds into this assumption that there will be challenges, there will be situations that need to be rethought and overcome. The real trick is making sure we move forward in a way that’s smart and focused on keeping things on time and on track. We're fortunate in the case of Nepal because we have a partner that has so heavily invested its own resources into the project.We have our $500 million grant and Nepal is putting in almost $200 million. It’s been made a national pride project. Look, other things will inevitably come up. But we believe that we have a good team that’s ready to tackle those types of challenges and press forward.At the end of the day, this can serve as a really positive model for how development assistance and how large-scale infrastructure projects can be implemented in a partnership that is largely the result of an internal domestic process. Don’t forget, Nepal requested the MCC project. The government of Nepal, through a consultative process, developed the idea, designed the project, and is now its lead implementer.We’re a financier and a partner but it is very much a Nepal-owned effort. Talking about challenges, there are many local governments and we have to deal with them every 10 to 15 kilometres in the project areas. Different communities have different concerns and priorities. This can add to some difficulty.What do you think will happen to the project if it cannot meet the five-year deadline?The fate of the project is to be completed in its entirety in five years. I can't speak to whether there’s going to be a particular challenge to delay it by six months or seven months or something like that. Right now, in our planning and projection, we hope that we can move it forward within the timeline.If it needs to go beyond that, we’ll work closely with our partner and figure it out. I’m confident that the $500 million that the US government is providing will be spent within the five years and it will lay a firm foundation for the completion of the project.But coming back to your scenario, indeed, you have different communities. A lot of people are affected by this. Now, on the one hand, that's why we encourage and insist on a consultative process, on everything being as transparent as possible so people know exactly what’s going to happen, that they know what the money is being spent on, what the effects will be in terms of how many trees will have to be cut down or what roads will be built where. That’s very important to us: no surprises for the communities that are out there.I think that we will rely on a lot of that effort to help us propel the project forward if things do get challenging on other fronts as well.Like you said, the project does need to be completed by a deadline of five years. Just in case it doesn’t, what happens?Look, it is an ambitious undertaking. There’s no question about it, right? And the Millennium Challenge Corporation is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. The MCA Nepal is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. But they’re also working closely together to make sure that it’s being done in a proper way, in a transparent way, and I’m confident that we will be able to complete what we need to complete. I’m also sure there’s a firm commitment from the government that if there’s a little piece left over here or there, to make sure it goes forward.I don’t worry about the ultimate completion of the project. I’m more focused on how we get it going as quickly as possible, because just the implementation of the project itself should employ close to 10,000 Nepalis, right? I really want communities to start to see the benefit of the project as soon as possible, because that’s where the transformative nature of it comes into play. Part of it is building it. Part of it is implementing it. Part of it is learning from that process. But then having this infrastructure in place, that’s what really changes the dynamic in Nepal and in the economic well-being of the country.Some fear that a failure to complete the project on time could even create rifts in our bilateral ties.I don’t think they should be fearful. We are partners in this, and if there’s any issue, if we're going to work through it together. What we should be doing is focusing entirely on implementing the project to its fullest potential as quickly as possible.Let’s move to geopolitics. What we see in the region is seemingly an exclusivist India-China geopolitical competition. Indians appear reluctant to work with the regimes that work closely with China. It's almost like they are saying, it's either the Chinese or us. How do you see this geopolitical dynamics playing out in Nepal? And where do the Americans fit in this picture?Yeah, it’s a good question in terms of the dynamic that’s in play today and where things are headed. We have of course been watching the India-China relationship and its development over the past few years with some degree of concern. Obviously, there was conflict there some years ago, and I think they’ve been trying to manage that since.And there’s no question that other countries in the region feel that very powerfully. From our standpoint, what we would like to see is the countries of the region—and particularly Nepal because that’s where I’m accredited and that’s where I have some level of knowledge—exercise their sovereignty and to have the space that they need to make decisions about they own future on behalf of their people in a positive way.We don’t believe countries should be asked to choose. We fully expect that Nepal is going to have good relations with India and China. They’re two neighbours. They’re large countries. They’re important countries in the region. It’s critically important for Nepal that it works with and benefits from both India and China.At the same time, we see no reason that should have any effect on our relationship with Nepal, and no reason Nepal should not be fully able to take full advantage of what the US has to offer. We will continue to watch and continue to work closely with Nepal as a partner and to encourage it to exercise its sovereignty and its decision-making in a way that benefits the Nepali people. The US-China relations are also very dicey at the moment. Surely this has some effect on how the US perceives the Chinese role around the world, including in Nepal.We had a recent high-level visit by our National Security Advisor [to China]. We’ve had recent visits by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Treasury. I think there’s a real effort to try to manage what we all acknowledge is as a competition that’s underway, in a way that’s positive and can maybe move us more towards some type of cooperative element.That channel should continue to be pursued by the US and China, but it’s not reflective of our relationship with Nepal, or our relationship with India. This is about what we can do together [with Nepal]. I’m not going to comment on what other countries may be saying about us, how they may be trying to influence us.I would commit to us remaining as transparent as possible so Nepalis can make their own decisions about what's happening by our relationship.Recently, the Americans were blamed for ousting Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh. The US is also often accused of meddling in the domestic affairs of other South Asian states, and in other parts of the world for that matter. How do you respond to this accusation?First off, I think you’ve got to take with a grain of salt anything that’s being said by someone who’s been forced to flee their country. The United States simply does not meddle in the internal politics of other countries. We work very hard to be as transparent as we possibly can about our relationships, about what we’re doing, about what we intend.That’s not to say that if we disagree vehemently with a country about a certain policy or a certain issue, we won’t raise it. But this idea that the US would find some benefit in enacting a change in government like that, it simply isn’t part of our repertoire of diplomacy. What we rather look to do is build the strongest relationships that we can.We love to do that primarily through people-to-people relationships and sponsoring as much development opportunity as we possibly can with our partner countries. So, I put no stock in these types of rumours and statements.There is also this sentiment that the Americans and the Indians are increasingly working together on strategic issues, and the same is seen even in South Asia.Certainly, there’s been a huge growth in the strategic partnership between the US and India. I think we want to see that continue to move forward in a positive way. At the same time, there have been disagreements between the US and India on various fronts, just as we have disagreements with many of our partners. And we try to deal with those in a proactive, professional and productive way.But, again, we see our relationship with each individual country through a bilateral lens. So if there are ways that the US and India working together can be beneficial, and another country agrees to such a cooperation, fine. But when it comes to Nepal, we’re going to base our relationship and our efforts first and foremost on our bilateral discussions and our bilateral relationship.Even as we speak, the US and Nepali armies are undertaking joint training in Nepal. How would you characterise the relations between the two armies?Yeah, the PAC ANGEL exercise is going on, focused on disaster relief, humanitarian assistance. The relationship between the two militaries has been strong, it remains strong, and I think it will continue to be strong primarily because we focus it on the areas Nepal wants to focus on—which is building a Nepal army that is capable of responding to disasters, providing humanitarian assistance, and then serving as part of the global peacekeeping network through the United Nations as the largest contributor force of peacekeepers. It’s in our interest to see Nepal continue to professionalise and develop its capacity on those fronts. That’s where our focus is, and that’s where we will continue to make efforts.There has also been a lot of debate in Nepal on the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and its applicability to South Asia. What is the current state of its application?The Indo-Pacific Strategy is a broad, big strategy by the United States government about how it looks at the entire region. And so it’s about how we create an open, independent, sovereign Indo-Pacific region for the benefit of all the people in the region.What we will continue to do is employ it to build relationships we have with each of the countries in the region. How can we continue to support democratic development? How can we continue to support economic development? Let’s not forget a huge portion, maybe 60 percent of the world’s commerce transits the Indo-Pacific corridor in some way, shape, or form every year.It’s in everyone’s interest for that to remain open and free. And for the countries of the region to be able to act in a sovereign way in their own interests.There is also a sizable section of Nepalis who believe that the IPS was brought with the intent of countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and that Nepal is struggling to find a balance between the two. What is your reading?The USAID, the MCC, the Development Finance Corporation, all of our development programmes have a singular purpose, which is to work with our bilateral partners to grow their economies, to make them more able to meet the needs of their people. That’s the goal. That's how they were designed. And that’s how we will continue to treat them.The BRI is China's initiative. It’s pushing that forward. It’s up to each country to decide how it wants to engage with others. We believe the model of, say, a USAID or an MCC is proving itself to be beneficial to countries, as they are grant-based and economic growth oriented. We’ll continue to push them because we think the data and historical experience we’ve had support them.I think it’s incumbent on us to try to help all of our partners relate to us as equals in any realm that we’re working together. That’s critically important and something we have to acknowledge and something we have to make sure that they’re able to acknowledge.It's about building trust, about showing that our intent is correct, that we have the best interest of our partners in mind, and that we’re applying the same and transparent standards universally.For example, on the MCC, we’ve published everything on the internet. If anybody in Nepal has a question about any aspect of the project, they can go to the website, they can read about the project, they can see the blueprints, they can know exactly what it’s going to involve. That's how I think we build relationships.I think if I came to Nepal and said, hey, I want to do X project because I want to counter this country, I don’t think I would get very good reception. We just don’t look at the world that way. It’s not a healthy approach in the long run.But a bilateral focus that seeks to empower the people of a country—that’s where I think we have the best chance of moving forward. Nepal’s Parliament has finally passed an amendment to the transitional justice law. How does the US see this development? How do you see the transitional justice process progressing?I think this is a really important step in the process. I would say that we remain positive about the way it's going and we are looking to see how we can help. You noted, I’m sure, that we joined a number of other partner countries in issuing a statement of support after the Parliament passed it.We all know bringing a conflict of this scale to conclusion is always going to be a challenge. The TJ legislation has passed, which was a tough hurdle, but implementation will also be difficult.We’re looking forward to figuring out how we can be supportive, and how other partners can be supportive. Some of that may be through bilateral means. Some of it may be through multilateral means.But what I remain encouraged about, in particular, is, we’ve always said this needs to be a Nepali-run process. It has been. That it needs to be victim-centric. I believe that it is. And so we need to make sure the consultative piece of this remains alive as you move to implementation, so that the victims groups, so that the child soldier groups, so that other entities that have been involved continue to have a voice and continue to work together to figure out how to resolve this, to make reparations work, to bring justice in those cases. And so, we are positive.Thousands of Nepali youths are leaving the country every single day in search of better jobs. In this light, do you see the prospect of greater American FDI helping Nepal build a more robust economy that can create enough good jobs?I do. At the beginning of the interview, I talked about some sectors of the economy that are quite exciting right now. I think you’re seeing a lot of interest from the US in the IT sector, the tourism sector, in the health sector, and in the energy sector as it continues to develop.We’re very keen to look for ways to bring more US investment here, whether it’s through equity sort of vehicles, or direct bilateral investments. I think that can also be positive. I think Nepal did a good job in setting up that April Investment Summit. That sent a really positive signal. You’ll recall that we had a representative from the US Chamber of Commerce, Atul Keshap, come out for that. We’ve had a great run of senior US visitors out here over the last year and a half.I think the key right now is for Nepal, through its private sector, through its government, to figure out how to make the environment for investment in Nepal as attractive as it can possibly be. In this interview, we’ve talked about the idea of competition between countries. One place where I will absolutely acknowledge there’s competition is in trying to attract investment.And so Nepal needs to figure out how to make itself as attractive as possible, and how to make it as easy as possible to do business. That helps not only investments that come from other countries, but makes it easier for Nepalis to start businesses, right? It makes it easier for Nepalis to operate and do what they want. And so, in addition to welcoming, say, US companies or British companies or Canadian companies, we would also love to see Nepalis who have gone abroad come back and start to help in building the economy here.We’ve seen how capable and how dynamic they are in building other people’s economies. Let’s do the same here at home.I mentioned that the trade and investment framework talks that we have with Nepal are in their seventh round. I look forward to, in the rest of my tenure here, to continue to build the momentum that will allow investment to take shape and the economy here to thrive.

We had a number of delays there from Covid to worldwide inflation, to supply chain shifts that I don’t think people had foreseen completely. I’m not surprised. But the MCC has had a lot of experience around the world with these projects.It builds into this assumption that there will be challenges, there will be situations that need to be rethought and overcome. The real trick is making sure we move forward in a way that’s smart and focused on keeping things on time and on track. We're fortunate in the case of Nepal because we have a partner that has so heavily invested its own resources into the project.We have our $500 million grant and Nepal is putting in almost $200 million. It’s been made a national pride project. Look, other things will inevitably come up. But we believe that we have a good team that’s ready to tackle those types of challenges and press forward.At the end of the day, this can serve as a really positive model for how development assistance and how large-scale infrastructure projects can be implemented in a partnership that is largely the result of an internal domestic process. Don’t forget, Nepal requested the MCC project. The government of Nepal, through a consultative process, developed the idea, designed the project, and is now its lead implementer.We’re a financier and a partner but it is very much a Nepal-owned effort. Talking about challenges, there are many local governments and we have to deal with them every 10 to 15 kilometres in the project areas. Different communities have different concerns and priorities. This can add to some difficulty.What do you think will happen to the project if it cannot meet the five-year deadline?The fate of the project is to be completed in its entirety in five years. I can't speak to whether there’s going to be a particular challenge to delay it by six months or seven months or something like that. Right now, in our planning and projection, we hope that we can move it forward within the timeline.If it needs to go beyond that, we’ll work closely with our partner and figure it out. I’m confident that the $500 million that the US government is providing will be spent within the five years and it will lay a firm foundation for the completion of the project.But coming back to your scenario, indeed, you have different communities. A lot of people are affected by this. Now, on the one hand, that's why we encourage and insist on a consultative process, on everything being as transparent as possible so people know exactly what’s going to happen, that they know what the money is being spent on, what the effects will be in terms of how many trees will have to be cut down or what roads will be built where. That’s very important to us: no surprises for the communities that are out there.I think that we will rely on a lot of that effort to help us propel the project forward if things do get challenging on other fronts as well.Like you said, the project does need to be completed by a deadline of five years. Just in case it doesn’t, what happens?Look, it is an ambitious undertaking. There’s no question about it, right? And the Millennium Challenge Corporation is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. The MCA Nepal is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. But they’re also working closely together to make sure that it’s being done in a proper way, in a transparent way, and I’m confident that we will be able to complete what we need to complete. I’m also sure there’s a firm commitment from the government that if there’s a little piece left over here or there, to make sure it goes forward.I don’t worry about the ultimate completion of the project. I’m more focused on how we get it going as quickly as possible, because just the implementation of the project itself should employ close to 10,000 Nepalis, right? I really want communities to start to see the benefit of the project as soon as possible, because that’s where the transformative nature of it comes into play. Part of it is building it. Part of it is implementing it. Part of it is learning from that process. But then having this infrastructure in place, that’s what really changes the dynamic in Nepal and in the economic well-being of the country.Some fear that a failure to complete the project on time could even create rifts in our bilateral ties.I don’t think they should be fearful. We are partners in this, and if there’s any issue, if we're going to work through it together. What we should be doing is focusing entirely on implementing the project to its fullest potential as quickly as possible.Let’s move to geopolitics. What we see in the region is seemingly an exclusivist India-China geopolitical competition. Indians appear reluctant to work with the regimes that work closely with China. It's almost like they are saying, it's either the Chinese or us. How do you see this geopolitical dynamics playing out in Nepal? And where do the Americans fit in this picture?Yeah, it’s a good question in terms of the dynamic that’s in play today and where things are headed. We have of course been watching the India-China relationship and its development over the past few years with some degree of concern. Obviously, there was conflict there some years ago, and I think they’ve been trying to manage that since.And there’s no question that other countries in the region feel that very powerfully. From our standpoint, what we would like to see is the countries of the region—and particularly Nepal because that’s where I’m accredited and that’s where I have some level of knowledge—exercise their sovereignty and to have the space that they need to make decisions about they own future on behalf of their people in a positive way.We don’t believe countries should be asked to choose. We fully expect that Nepal is going to have good relations with India and China. They’re two neighbours. They’re large countries. They’re important countries in the region. It’s critically important for Nepal that it works with and benefits from both India and China.At the same time, we see no reason that should have any effect on our relationship with Nepal, and no reason Nepal should not be fully able to take full advantage of what the US has to offer. We will continue to watch and continue to work closely with Nepal as a partner and to encourage it to exercise its sovereignty and its decision-making in a way that benefits the Nepali people. The US-China relations are also very dicey at the moment. Surely this has some effect on how the US perceives the Chinese role around the world, including in Nepal.We had a recent high-level visit by our National Security Advisor [to China]. We’ve had recent visits by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Treasury. I think there’s a real effort to try to manage what we all acknowledge is as a competition that’s underway, in a way that’s positive and can maybe move us more towards some type of cooperative element.That channel should continue to be pursued by the US and China, but it’s not reflective of our relationship with Nepal, or our relationship with India. This is about what we can do together [with Nepal]. I’m not going to comment on what other countries may be saying about us, how they may be trying to influence us.I would commit to us remaining as transparent as possible so Nepalis can make their own decisions about what's happening by our relationship.Recently, the Americans were blamed for ousting Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh. The US is also often accused of meddling in the domestic affairs of other South Asian states, and in other parts of the world for that matter. How do you respond to this accusation?First off, I think you’ve got to take with a grain of salt anything that’s being said by someone who’s been forced to flee their country. The United States simply does not meddle in the internal politics of other countries. We work very hard to be as transparent as we possibly can about our relationships, about what we’re doing, about what we intend.That’s not to say that if we disagree vehemently with a country about a certain policy or a certain issue, we won’t raise it. But this idea that the US would find some benefit in enacting a change in government like that, it simply isn’t part of our repertoire of diplomacy. What we rather look to do is build the strongest relationships that we can.We love to do that primarily through people-to-people relationships and sponsoring as much development opportunity as we possibly can with our partner countries. So, I put no stock in these types of rumours and statements.There is also this sentiment that the Americans and the Indians are increasingly working together on strategic issues, and the same is seen even in South Asia.Certainly, there’s been a huge growth in the strategic partnership between the US and India. I think we want to see that continue to move forward in a positive way. At the same time, there have been disagreements between the US and India on various fronts, just as we have disagreements with many of our partners. And we try to deal with those in a proactive, professional and productive way.But, again, we see our relationship with each individual country through a bilateral lens. So if there are ways that the US and India working together can be beneficial, and another country agrees to such a cooperation, fine. But when it comes to Nepal, we’re going to base our relationship and our efforts first and foremost on our bilateral discussions and our bilateral relationship.Even as we speak, the US and Nepali armies are undertaking joint training in Nepal. How would you characterise the relations between the two armies?Yeah, the PAC ANGEL exercise is going on, focused on disaster relief, humanitarian assistance. The relationship between the two militaries has been strong, it remains strong, and I think it will continue to be strong primarily because we focus it on the areas Nepal wants to focus on—which is building a Nepal army that is capable of responding to disasters, providing humanitarian assistance, and then serving as part of the global peacekeeping network through the United Nations as the largest contributor force of peacekeepers. It’s in our interest to see Nepal continue to professionalise and develop its capacity on those fronts. That’s where our focus is, and that’s where we will continue to make efforts.There has also been a lot of debate in Nepal on the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and its applicability to South Asia. What is the current state of its application?The Indo-Pacific Strategy is a broad, big strategy by the United States government about how it looks at the entire region. And so it’s about how we create an open, independent, sovereign Indo-Pacific region for the benefit of all the people in the region.What we will continue to do is employ it to build relationships we have with each of the countries in the region. How can we continue to support democratic development? How can we continue to support economic development? Let’s not forget a huge portion, maybe 60 percent of the world’s commerce transits the Indo-Pacific corridor in some way, shape, or form every year.It’s in everyone’s interest for that to remain open and free. And for the countries of the region to be able to act in a sovereign way in their own interests.There is also a sizable section of Nepalis who believe that the IPS was brought with the intent of countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and that Nepal is struggling to find a balance between the two. What is your reading?The USAID, the MCC, the Development Finance Corporation, all of our development programmes have a singular purpose, which is to work with our bilateral partners to grow their economies, to make them more able to meet the needs of their people. That’s the goal. That's how they were designed. And that’s how we will continue to treat them.The BRI is China's initiative. It’s pushing that forward. It’s up to each country to decide how it wants to engage with others. We believe the model of, say, a USAID or an MCC is proving itself to be beneficial to countries, as they are grant-based and economic growth oriented. We’ll continue to push them because we think the data and historical experience we’ve had support them.I think it’s incumbent on us to try to help all of our partners relate to us as equals in any realm that we’re working together. That’s critically important and something we have to acknowledge and something we have to make sure that they’re able to acknowledge.It's about building trust, about showing that our intent is correct, that we have the best interest of our partners in mind, and that we’re applying the same and transparent standards universally.For example, on the MCC, we’ve published everything on the internet. If anybody in Nepal has a question about any aspect of the project, they can go to the website, they can read about the project, they can see the blueprints, they can know exactly what it’s going to involve. That's how I think we build relationships.I think if I came to Nepal and said, hey, I want to do X project because I want to counter this country, I don’t think I would get very good reception. We just don’t look at the world that way. It’s not a healthy approach in the long run.But a bilateral focus that seeks to empower the people of a country—that’s where I think we have the best chance of moving forward. Nepal’s Parliament has finally passed an amendment to the transitional justice law. How does the US see this development? How do you see the transitional justice process progressing?I think this is a really important step in the process. I would say that we remain positive about the way it's going and we are looking to see how we can help. You noted, I’m sure, that we joined a number of other partner countries in issuing a statement of support after the Parliament passed it.We all know bringing a conflict of this scale to conclusion is always going to be a challenge. The TJ legislation has passed, which was a tough hurdle, but implementation will also be difficult.We’re looking forward to figuring out how we can be supportive, and how other partners can be supportive. Some of that may be through bilateral means. Some of it may be through multilateral means.But what I remain encouraged about, in particular, is, we’ve always said this needs to be a Nepali-run process. It has been. That it needs to be victim-centric. I believe that it is. And so we need to make sure the consultative piece of this remains alive as you move to implementation, so that the victims groups, so that the child soldier groups, so that other entities that have been involved continue to have a voice and continue to work together to figure out how to resolve this, to make reparations work, to bring justice in those cases. And so, we are positive.Thousands of Nepali youths are leaving the country every single day in search of better jobs. In this light, do you see the prospect of greater American FDI helping Nepal build a more robust economy that can create enough good jobs?I do. At the beginning of the interview, I talked about some sectors of the economy that are quite exciting right now. I think you’re seeing a lot of interest from the US in the IT sector, the tourism sector, in the health sector, and in the energy sector as it continues to develop.We’re very keen to look for ways to bring more US investment here, whether it’s through equity sort of vehicles, or direct bilateral investments. I think that can also be positive. I think Nepal did a good job in setting up that April Investment Summit. That sent a really positive signal. You’ll recall that we had a representative from the US Chamber of Commerce, Atul Keshap, come out for that. We’ve had a great run of senior US visitors out here over the last year and a half.I think the key right now is for Nepal, through its private sector, through its government, to figure out how to make the environment for investment in Nepal as attractive as it can possibly be. In this interview, we’ve talked about the idea of competition between countries. One place where I will absolutely acknowledge there’s competition is in trying to attract investment.And so Nepal needs to figure out how to make itself as attractive as possible, and how to make it as easy as possible to do business. That helps not only investments that come from other countries, but makes it easier for Nepalis to start businesses, right? It makes it easier for Nepalis to operate and do what they want. And so, in addition to welcoming, say, US companies or British companies or Canadian companies, we would also love to see Nepalis who have gone abroad come back and start to help in building the economy here.We’ve seen how capable and how dynamic they are in building other people’s economies. Let’s do the same here at home.I mentioned that the trade and investment framework talks that we have with Nepal are in their seventh round. I look forward to, in the rest of my tenure here, to continue to build the momentum that will allow investment to take shape and the economy here to thrive.

He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well.

Then Congress chief Deuba will lead the government until the elections in November-December 2027. Sharma urged Deuba to leave the prime minister’s post for another senior Congress leader. Deuba reportedly rejected the proposal outright.“I will not give up the position just because someone so desires,” Deuba reportedly said in response.Sharma, one of the two general secretaries of the country’s oldest political party, had proposed an exit policy in his contemporary political proposal tabled at the Mahasamiti meeting in February for the leaders holding state positions such as president, prime minister, ministers.Besides Sharma's proposal, the Mahasamiti also endorsed the papers submitted by Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka and General Secretary Gagan Thapa. However, it also gave room for the central committee to modify the proposal. When the central committee approved Khadka’s policy proposal and Thapa’s organisational proposal with minor changes, Sharma’s paper was pushed back to be considered while amending the national constitution.Sharma proposed one term for the [country’s] President, two terms for the prime minister, three terms for ministers, and four terms for lawmakers. Sharma’s proposal on term limits on persons serving as the country’s president or the prime minister is a national rather than the party’s issue, so it has been deferred, according to party leaders. Most of the Congress central leaders who spoke at the meeting, which lasted almost a month with gaps in between, claimed that fixing a time limit for the leadership was contrary to the democratic principle that the party champions.UML chief whip Mahesh Bartaula also says that since politics is a voluntary job, the politicians should be able to contribute to the society for as long as they want. “Nonetheless, the exit policy proposal is thought-provoking,” Bartaula told the Post. As a new generation of leaders is yet to be fully developed, the public still trusts the older crop of leaders, he argues. “Those vying for top positions are yet to gain the public’s credibility.”For Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, it would be unnatural to amend the constitution to address Sharma’s demand. “In countries where people directly elect their prime minister, amending the constitution to limit the executive head’s term could be reasonable” Pokharel told the Post. “However, in a country like Nepal where the parties choose the prime minister, exit policy should rather be mentioned in the party’s statute.” Had Nepali leaders internalised the spirit of the parliamentary system, their entry and exit points need not have been discussed. “The parliamentary system in Nepal has been vulgarised,” Pokharel added. According to political experts, despite the Congress leaders criticising the exit policy at the central committee, the proposal’s public appeal is growing. They see no alternative to its implementation, sooner or later. One reason for growing public disenchantment with political parties is that the same old faces have continued in leadership positions for a long time. If there were a term limit for a leader in a governmental or party position, people’s dissatisfaction would somehow be addressed.Experts say the recent political upheaval in Bangladesh and the political crisis of Sri Lanka two years ago were due to the continuous rule by a single person or a single family.One reason some democracies struggle is their political leaders’ unlimited hunger for power, Uddab Pyakurel, a political analyst, told the Post. “In Nordic countries, there is no need to set term limits for leaders as there is already a strong democratic culture there.” Despite having leaders like Donald Trump, American democracy still works, partly because of the term limits, Pyakurel reasoned. “If Nepal is to strengthen its democratic system, it must implement the exit policy for political leaders,” he said. Some political experts see problems even after introducing a term limit.Arguing that limiting the tenure for top positions alone is not enough to put curbs on autocratic tendencies, Khagendra Prasai, another political analyst, said: “The major issue is developing political mannerism and culture.”Calls for the top party leadership making way for a new generation are growing not just in the Congress. Even during the CPN (Maoist Centre) standing committee meeting last month, Deputy General Secretary Janardan Sharma questioned Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s uninterrupted leadership for nearly 35 years. Sharma even urged Dahal to resign the position. Experts say leaders with limited terms realise they must get a lot done within the given time at the top. There is no slow cooldown period. The current set of top party leaders—Deuba, Oli and Dahal in particular—have been in power for two or three decades, repeatedly assuming the country’s top executive position. Article 216 (7) of the Constitution of Nepal says a person elected mayor for two terms will not be eligible to be a candidate in future municipal elections. Article 215 (7) has a similar provision for chairpersons of rural municipalities.The constitution also has a two-term limit for President.While all other top governing posts come with fixed terms, there are limits on how many times the prime minister, chief ministers, ministers, and lawmakers can serve. This allows politicians to occupy office for as long as they choose, preventing the leadership handover to the next generation. In the view of Mighendra Bahadur Karki, executive director of the Centre for Nepal and Asia Studies (CNAS) at Tribhuvan University: “Leaders who know that their peers, even junior colleagues, may someday be their supervisors may be more thoughtful of their behaviour. Poor behaviour and status anxiety might be reduced, increasing the room for collaboration.” If senior leaders know that they need to bow out of the government or the party after a particular time, they are more likely to train and promote junior leaders to take their place, Karki told the Post. “This in turn will cultivate a healthy political culture.”But he warned that the question of term limit is not straightforward. “The exit policy, if it is to be implemented, should be system-centric rather than targeting particular leaders.” ","summary":"On September 1, on the final day of the Nepali Congress Central Working Committee meeting, General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma explicitly urged Sher Bahadur Deuba, the party president, to give up his aspirations to be the prime minister yet again.As per the seven-point agreement between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1, UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, the incumbent prime minister, will lead the government for the first two years. Then Congress chief Deuba will lead the government until the elections in November-December 2027. Sharma urged Deuba to leave the prime minister’s post for another senior Congress leader. Deuba reportedly rejected the proposal outright.“I will not give up the position just because someone so desires,” Deuba reportedly said in response.Sharma, one of the two general secretaries of the country’s oldest political party, had proposed an exit policy in his contemporary political proposal tabled at the Mahasamiti meeting in February for the leaders holding state positions such as president, prime minister, ministers.Besides Sharma's proposal, the Mahasamiti also endorsed the papers submitted by Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka and General Secretary Gagan Thapa. However, it also gave room for the central committee to modify the proposal. When the central committee approved Khadka’s policy proposal and Thapa’s organisational proposal with minor changes, Sharma’s paper was pushed back to be considered while amending the national constitution.Sharma proposed one term for the [country’s] President, two terms for the prime minister, three terms for ministers, and four terms for lawmakers. Sharma’s proposal on term limits on persons serving as the country’s president or the prime minister is a national rather than the party’s issue, so it has been deferred, according to party leaders. Most of the Congress central leaders who spoke at the meeting, which lasted almost a month with gaps in between, claimed that fixing a time limit for the leadership was contrary to the democratic principle that the party champions.UML chief whip Mahesh Bartaula also says that since politics is a voluntary job, the politicians should be able to contribute to the society for as long as they want. “Nonetheless, the exit policy proposal is thought-provoking,” Bartaula told the Post. As a new generation of leaders is yet to be fully developed, the public still trusts the older crop of leaders, he argues. “Those vying for top positions are yet to gain the public’s credibility.”For Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, it would be unnatural to amend the constitution to address Sharma’s demand. “In countries where people directly elect their prime minister, amending the constitution to limit the executive head’s term could be reasonable” Pokharel told the Post. “However, in a country like Nepal where the parties choose the prime minister, exit policy should rather be mentioned in the party’s statute.” Had Nepali leaders internalised the spirit of the parliamentary system, their entry and exit points need not have been discussed. “The parliamentary system in Nepal has been vulgarised,” Pokharel added.

Krishna Prasad Paudel, chief secretary at the party office, says many central leaders have already reached the districts they are assigned to run campaign activities.According to Paudel, the party’s seven joint general secretaries lead the campaign in the seven provinces. Senior leaders Krishna Sitaula, Shashank Koirala, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar, along with some central committee leaders, have either reached the assigned districts or are on the way, Paudel said.“When the party’s senior leaders and central committee members are in their districts, vice presidents and general secretaries of the party will monitor the campaign activities,” Paudel told the Post. “If necessary, the vice presidents, the general secretaries, and the party president will go to some districts.”One of the main objectives of the campaign is to renew party membership. “We claim our party has 0.9 million members,” Paudel said. “During the campaign, leaders will check the trend of party members renewing their membership.”The campaign has been launched at a time when leaders have already started to devise their plans for the next general convention. As per the Congress statute, the party must hold its general convention every four years. The party’s 14th general convention was held in December 2021. If the statute is followed, the party’s next convention should be convened by the end of 2025.Some Congress leaders have floated the proposal of contesting the next general election on its own, without forging electoral alliance with other parties. General Secretary Gagan Thapa floated a proposal to this effect at the Mahasamiti meeting in February that forwarded the proposal to the central committee to take a decision on the issue.“If we are to fight elections on our own [without an alliance], we need a strong organisation, therefore the party is emphasising strengthening the party by conducting campaigns,” Paudel told the Post.But, for the party leaders, success of the campaign will largely depend on the way it will be run.“Will the party leaders try to connect the party organisation to the public or will they conduct it in just a traditional manner? This will determine the success of the campaign,” Guru Ghimire, a Congress leader, told the Post.Ghimire suggested that the party leaders should also gauge the strengths and weaknesses of other parties in the districts.Ghimire also advised the leaders not to use the campaign as an opportunity to promote factional activities.When public disenchantment towards the major parties is growing fast, the campaign the Congress has decided to carry forward could be a means to connect the leaders with the public, says a Congress leader.“This campaign will re-energise the relations between the party and the public, and the party should work hard to make this event fruitful without baggage of internal factions,” Sanjay Kumar Gautam, a Congress lawmaker, told the Post.Reconnecting with the public is a compulsion for the political parties, say political experts. Soon after the November 2022 election, major political parties including the Congress held several campaigns to reconnect with the people but the masses may not be quite impressed by the leaders’ announcements they make during the rallies unless they deliver when in power. Earlier, the CPN-UML carried out various drives such as ‘mission grassroots’, a march along Mid-Hill Highway. “Political parties’ efforts to get connected with the people is something commendable in itself,” Geja Sharma Wagle, a political analyst close to the Congress, told the Post. “But, if the political parties don’t deliver while they are in government, people might not be convinced by their pledges.”Wagle adds that as the Congress is in government, people take the leaders’ speeches seriously only if they work for them sincerely.During the 100-day campaign, the party has decided to inform the party members and local leaders regarding the seven-point agreement reached between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1. Based on the same agreement, the two parties formed the coalition government led by UML chair KP Sharma Oli on July 15. As per the deal, Oli will hand over the government leadership to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba after two years.Besides their power-sharing in the federal government, the Congress and the UML have shared powers in provincial governments as well. While Koshi, Lumbini and Karnali provincial governments are led by the UML, Congress provincial lawmakers head Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudurpaschim governments. The two big parties have backed Janamat Party to head the provincial government in Madhesh.During a meeting of the coalition partners held in Singha Durbar on September 9, Prime Minister Oli had reportedly complained that the coalition partners did not work enough to counter the ‘disinformation campaign of the opposition parties’ against the Oli government. “The opposition has spread confusion about the government, but the parties in government have not shown any interest in countering the disinformation,” the prime minister had reportedly said at the meeting. “All the ruling partners should defend the government.”Congress leaders will inform the party’s district representatives about the spirit of collaboration with the UML, constitutional amendments, and other issues. They are also responsible for informing the party members at the grassroots about policies such as the common minimum programme.Earlier this month, the Congress-UML coalition brought the programme that has, among other things, reiterated its commitment to reviewing the achievements made and weaknesses observed in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years.

In the wake of consultative meetings in seven provinces and its foreign units, party leaders have stressed the need for fresh ideas based on the party’s historic Chunwang meeting of 2005 that adopted ‘democratic republicanism’.Until this July, the party has continuously been in power since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. Back during the insurgency days, the meeting held at Chunwang in Rukum district had endorsed the party’s political line advocating for promulgating a constitution through a constituent assembly. On this basis, the party in 2006 signed the Comprehensive Peace Accord with the then seven-party alliance and laid down arms to enter mainstream politics.The 2015 constitution envisions Nepal as a socialism-oriented country, with the Maoist Centre playing a key role in shaping that direction. But why, after all these years, is the party revisiting the question of socialism?Maoist Centre spokesman, Agni Sapkota, argues that the party has been discussing socialism in various forums. “But this time, we want a more intense and focussed discussion.” Tensions within the party also came to light during the party’s standing committee meeting in August where office bearers openly questioned the leadership of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. In response, the party decided to hold consultative meetings in all provinces to discuss the matter. Besides the provincial meetings, the party also consulted its foreign branches known as ‘pradesh committees’ in India, West Asia, and Eurasia.According to Sapkota, the Maoist Centre leadership got three mandates at the consultative meetings that concluded on September 20.“Besides the need for discussion on party ideology, the consultative meetings’ mandates include improving organisational management and updating party statute, changing leaders’ behaviour, and improving their secretariat work,” Sapkota told the Post. Likewise, another party leader, Dor Prasad Upadhyaya, says democratic socialism naturally aligns with the ideology of the Nepali Congress, whereas ‘people’s multiparty democracy’ is the ideology of the CPN-UML. “As for the Maoist Center, we lack a distinct political ideology clearly reflecting the party’s vision.”Although the party claims its ideology is ‘people’s democracy of the 21st century’, party leaders admit that its impact is diluted by lack of commitment. Party leaders said that there was no call for a leadership change during the consultative meetings. However, at the standing committee meeting in August, a deputy general secretary of the party, Janardan Sharma, submitted a 14-page document calling for a change in party leadership.Sharma and Barsha Man Pun—another deputy general secretary of the Maoist party—urged Dahal to pass over party reins to new generation leaders. According to leaders, some within the party feel that Dahal should not leave a leadership vacuum until a clear plan for leadership transition is in place.Likewise, Ram Karki, the party’s secretary, says the consultative meetings were focussed at preparing a political document that would be presented at the central committee meeting in November. “The consultative meetings were focused on the party’s diminishing influence in national politics,” Karki told the Post. “Despite our party leaders who were in government claiming that they did an excellent job, why hasn’t that reflected in the party’s life? This was a major concern expressed during the meetings.”Karki said the meeting also directed the party to remain open for cooperation with other parties with socialist inclinations. When asked about possible cooperation with the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), Karki dismissed the idea. “Lately, there have been some points of agreement between the two parties. But, I don’t see any prospect of the two parties getting into a working partnership,” Karki said. “The consultative meetings have said the party leadership is open to cooperation with socialist parties except the RSP.”The RSP—which was one of the junior partners in the immediate past government led by Maoist Centre chief Dahal before the government was toppled on July 12—appears to be on the same page with the Maoist Centre on many issues lately. But the two parties rule out cooperation on the political front.Party spokesperson Sapkota also says that his party can cooperate with the RSP in parliament on issues of public interest, but there is no possibility of forging a working alliance with the party. RSP chair Rabi Lamichhane, who presented his political document at the party's first national conference held for two days in Kathmandu earlier this month, also hinted at potential cooperation with like-minded parties. Despite this, RSP leaders declined cooperation with the Maoist Centre. The Maoist Centre’s consultative meetings have suggested that the party consider unification with other parties in order to revitalise the communist movement, Sapkota added.  ","summary":"After being ousted from government for the first time in nine years, the CPN (Maoist Centre) appears to be at a turning point as it seeks to redefine its vision of socialism.

But, I don’t see any prospect of the two parties getting into a working partnership,” Karki said. “The consultative meetings have said the party leadership is open to cooperation with socialist parties except the RSP.”The RSP—which was one of the junior partners in the immediate past government led by Maoist Centre chief Dahal before the government was toppled on July 12—appears to be on the same page with the Maoist Centre on many issues lately. But the two parties rule out cooperation on the political front.Party spokesperson Sapkota also says that his party can cooperate with the RSP in parliament on issues of public interest, but there is no possibility of forging a working alliance with the party. RSP chair Rabi Lamichhane, who presented his political document at the party's first national conference held for two days in Kathmandu earlier this month, also hinted at potential cooperation with like-minded parties. Despite this, RSP leaders declined cooperation with the Maoist Centre. The Maoist Centre’s consultative meetings have suggested that the party consider unification with other parties in order to revitalise the communist movement, Sapkota added.  "},{"hash":"449880749bb09048d601bba30ba2c365da416b0212f2b3aecfbd025c5130e60c","title":"sue-lamichhane-say-all-national-parties-bar-rsp","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/09/25/sue-lamichhane-say-all-national-parties-bar-rsp","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/thumb-1727225092.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1727222400000,"source":"kp","category":"politics","content":"The Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), the fourth largest in Parliament, is fiercely resisting what it claims are government moves to arrest its chair, Rabi Lamichhane, over allegations of his involvement in cooperatives fraud. But all the other national parties seem to be in favour of his prosecution. Among the seven national parties in Parliament, there is a growing consensus for holding Lamichhane accountable. A party needs to win at least one FPTP seat and get three percent proportional representation votes to get national party status.Ruling coalition partners such as the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML, Ashok Rai’s Janata Samajbadi Party, and the Janamat Party believe that RSP chair Lamichhane should face the law. Additionally, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the main opposition in Parliament, along with the Rastriya Prajantra Party and Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), both of which are outside the coalition, also support the parliamentary probe’s findings and advocate action against Lamichhane. The CPN (Unified Socialist), which is not a national party but has 10 seats in the lower house, has also joined the ranks of parties that want Lamichhane prosecuted. “Our party believes that, as a matter of principle, no innocent should be punished, and no guilty evade the law,” says the Maoist Centre Secretary Devendra Paudel.On the probe panel’s findings, Paudel said, “Evidence suggests that Lamichhane misused cooperative funds,” Paudel told the Post. “He should be held accountable for his actions as per the law.” A source close to Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak while talking to the Post said, “If everything goes as planned, the police will arrest Lamichhane soon.”However, during a recent interview with Kantipur Television’s Fireside program, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of the Maoist Centre, was noncommittal on whether Lamichhane should be prosecuted for misusing cooperative funds.But party secretary Paudel said his party would take a stand against Lamichhane’s misuse of cooperative funds.Unified Socialist spokesperson Jagannath Khatiwada says that the probe panel’s recommendations should be implemented. “Although our party has yet to take an official position on it, I can say that our leaders are discussing the parliamentary probe report and there is a general consensus that the report’s recommendations should be implemented.”“The report suggests that the government should further investigate and prosecute four key people [Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabi Joshi, and Kumar Ramtel] involved in the misuse of multiple cooperative funds, and our party supports the report,” Khatiwada told the Post. “Those proven guilty should be booked under the prevailing laws.” While Rai is on the run, Ramtel is in judicial custody of Kaski police. After arresting Joshi, Police are now waiting for the government’s green light to arrest Lamichhane, who has twice served as deputy prime minister and home minister.The Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), led by Upendra Yadav, also views Lamichhane as culpable in the misuse of the cooperative funds and disputes the RSP’s claim that he got a clean chit from the parliamentary special probe. “Our party does not want to disrespect any political leaders as such, but that does not mean a guilty individual should escape legal repercussions,” Manish Kumar Suman, the party central spokesperson, told the Post. “The report clearly indicates Lamichhane’s involvement in misusing cooperative funds, so there is no question of him getting a clear chit, unlike what the RSP leaders claim.” Rastriya Prajatantra Party Vice President Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan says the parliamentary probe panel, which investigated crisis-ridden cooperatives, has done its job and submitted a report and now it is the government’s responsibility to act on the recommendations.“As for our party’s position, Lamichhane should be prosecuted under the prevailing laws, as per the special committee’s report,” Pradhan told the Post. Lamichhane is accused of siphoning funds from multiple cooperatives to run the Gorkha Media Network, which operated the Galaxy 4k Television channel. The channel shut down last year. Chairman GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai and managing director Lamichhane jointly ran the media company before Lamichhane quit it to join politics in June 2022. On September 16, the parliamentary special committee submitted its report to Speaker Ghimire, who forwarded it to the government on the same day. On September 19, the Cabinet owned the report and ordered responsible ministries to act based on its findings. The probe panel’s report does not directly implicate Lamichhane in rerouting cooperative funds into the media, but it does label him guilty of using cooperative funds for Gorkha Media Network. The panel has recommended that the government prosecute Lamichhane; his business partner Rai; one of the founders of Gorkha Media Company, Chhabi Joshi; and board member Kumar Ramtel. As the panel report could not establish a direct link between Lamichhane and the rerouting of cooperative funds, RSP leaders interpret it as a ‘clean chit’ for their party chief. But leaders from other parties reject this claim.“The way RSP leaders are trying to interpret the probe panel’s report is distortion,” Pradhan said.Based on the report, the crime division of Nepal Police arrested Joshi, former deputy inspector general of Nepal Police and one of the founders of Gorkha Media Network, on the orders of Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak on Sunday. Following this, RSP chair Lamichhane organised a gathering of party sympathisers at his office to condemn the government amid rumours of his impending arrest. While addressing supporters at the RSP headquarters in Balaju, Kathmandu on Sunday evening, he urged them to be prepared to defend their new political force, claiming that a plan was afoot to ‘finish Rabi Lamichhane and the Rastriya Swatantra Party.’The erstwhile main opposition party, Nepali Congress, had continuously disrupted the parliamentary proceedings for over two months demanding a probe into the cooperatives scam, especially its connections to the Gorkha Media Network.

However, during our three days in Kathmandu, we witnessed it,” a group of party members told the Post. It seems that President Rabi Lamichhane and Vice-president Swarnim Wagle are not in the same boat on how the party should function, they added.RSP acting spokesperson Manish Jha explains that it is the lack of synchronisation—rather than differences—between the leaders. “People from various schools of thought came together to form the RSP. It is true that we lack synchronisation, but it would be wrong to portray it as differences.”Another leader of the party said on condition of anonymity that the party has two schools of thought—one based on democratic principles and the other opposed to it.RSP acting general secretary Kabindra Burlakoti claims that the party is united.In conversations with the Post, representatives from Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara and Chitwan sounded more optimistic with the central leadership while those from remote areas were confused over their take on the party’s central leadership.The representatives from Madhesh were mild in their opinion about the leadership.Moreover, representatives were also not very positive about the way the central leadership is investing their energy to claim that Lamichhane had got a clean chit from the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives.The probe panel, which submitted its report to the House of Representatives, has recommended the government prosecute Lamichhane, along with his former business partner GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai, board member of the media Kumar Ramtel and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi as per the prevailing laws. The inquiry committee, however, has said it couldn’t establish Lamichhane’s role in rerouting the cooperatives fund to Gorkha Media Network.“It would have been better had the central leadership waited to see how the government would take action,” the group of representatives from western Nepal told the Post. “In case Lamichhane is booked under the law, it could be counterproductive for the party in the long run.”The political campaign started by the RSP won’t get stalled even without Lamichhane, the representatives said, expressing their confidence in the party’s longevity.Lamichhane also presented a political report incorporating proposed statutory changes, the party’s commitments to voters, policy agenda presented by Swarnim Wagle at the Jaleshwar meeting and the conclusion drawn from the closed session of the national conference.Lamichhane’s report states that the policy paper presented in Jaleshwar defined ‘constitutional socialism’ as the party’s political ideology. Lamichhane also accuses the ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML of trying to lead the country to a two-party system by polarising smaller parties. “On the pretext of administrative reform, they are planning to wipe out the existence of small parties,” the report reads. “Potentially, this step can bring together new parties that want to be an alternative political force sooner or later.”Asked about RSP’s possible alliance with other parties, Burlakoti said though they are not in talks with the main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre), they are in regular contact with several independent candidates of last election.Asked if they are in discussion with Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balendra Shah, who won the 2022 local election independently, Burlakoti said: “Strategic moves are not to be disclosed.”However, when the national conference concluded after Lamichhane presented his report, representatives arriving from around the country were displeased.“This is not the way a party functions,” a representative told the Post, asking not to be named for fears of reprisal.When leaders put themselves at the centre and cadres in the periphery, the party’s downfall begins, another representative said. Acting General Secretary Burlakoti, however, defended the party leadership. “Our national conference was designed this way,” Burlakoti said. The report presented by the chair will be discussed in the party’s Mahakali-Mechi campaign that will start soon, he added.“At the national conference, we gave 5 percent of the total representatives (1500) time to speak, but those who spoke exceeded that number,” Burlakoti said.The conference, however, passed Lamichhane’s report. On Wednesday, Lamichhane announced the date of the party’s first general convention. It will be held on May 8-10 at a yet-undecided venue.“I would like to inform you that the Central Committee has become the general convention organising committee,” Burlakoti said. Lamichhane also announced the ‘Mahakali-Mechi Campaign’ to interact with the general public.In his report, Lamichhane has proposed a person not affiliated to any party to be elected the country’s president, directly elected executive head, or the prime minister. He also proposes giving the nation’s vice president the responsibility to chair the National Assembly.While the paper bats for a fully proportional electoral system, it says provincial assemblies cannot be accepted in the current shape.However, this does not mean the RSP is against the federal structure gained through the sacrifice of thousands of people, another representative said. “Our party has no strength to amend the constitution and scrap the federal structure. Therefore, for the time being, voices are growing among the party members about accepting the present political structure,” Khemraj Koirala, a conference representative from Kailali told the Post.Party members also suggested downsizing the number of ministers to make the provincial system functional, Koirala said.The report also stands for reducing the number of municipalities to less than 500, from the current 753.

Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways.

Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways.

Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” ","summary":"The rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers.

He emphasised that the event will be instrumental in reactivating the tourism sector, which has slowed down due to the pandemic, and in attracting a new wave of domestic and foreign visitors.Dhanraj Acharya, mayor of Pokhara Metropolitan City, expressed his enthusiasm for the festival, stating that it is a welcome addition to Pokhara’s tourism calendar. He pledged his support as a protector and promoter of similar events in the city.BB Dhakal, director of Nepal Balloon, said Pokhara, rich in natural resources, has been evolving into an adventure tourism destination. \"In this context, the balloon festival will help solidify Pokhara's reputation as an adventure tourism hub.”The concept of international balloon festivals isn't new. The Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, first held in the US in 1972, sees about 500 hot air balloons flying annually in New Mexico, attracting over a million tourists. Other notable festivals include the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta in England, the Saga International Balloon Fiesta in Japan, the Mondial Air Balloons Event in France, and the Cappadocia International Balloon Festival in Turkey.During the Pokhara festival, professional pilots representing different countries will fly hot air balloons daily—in the morning, afternoon, and the evening. The festival will see around 500 commercial flights and is expected to host around 3,000 passengers, along with 300 non-commercial flights.The organiser said a mini balloon show will also be organised, with performances by renowned national and local artists. Traditional Nepali cultural exhibitions and displays from other countries will be featured. Attendees can also enjoy local food stalls and various entertainment activities.The organisers estimate that Rs68.3 million will be spent on the festival, which is expected to boost Pokhara's post-pandemic tourism recovery.Hot air balloon flights typically last around 40 minutes, offering a panoramic view of the Pokhara valley, including the majestic snow-capped ranges of Annapurna, Machhapuchhre, and Dhaulagiri. In addition to the stunning sunrise and sunset views, the festival will feature night balloon glows, daily 20-minute fireworks displays, balloon races, concerts, various games, food courts, cultural dances, DJ music, and night camps.Balloon Nepal, established in 2016, has been operating commercial hot air balloon flights in Pokhara since 2018. The company recently participated in the February International Balloon Fiesta, 2024, held in Thailand.

But people are not very happy.Everest Bank has established a branch in Dhuli village, which is the gateway to the rural municipality.There are 107 banking and financial institutions in Nepal. As of mid-August, 20 commercial banks, 17 development banks, 17 finance companies, 52 microfinance institutions, and one infrastructure development bank are in operation. The banking branches number 11,541.Only Sapial municipality did not have a bank branch out of the 753 local governing units—metropolitan cities, sub-metropolitan cities, municipalities and rural municipalities.Despite the establishment of the first branch, locals are not happy.“It takes a day-long walk for a young adult to reach Dhuli. For older people, it takes two days,” said Tikaram Gurung, a resident of Dhuli. “Even if the branch has been established, it’s not going to ease the problems of the elderly, who can now withdraw their social security allowances from the branch.”The opening of the first branch in Sapial will not address the grievances of the elderly and differently-abled people as they still need to be carried on the back to claim the social security fund, Gurung added. Instead, setting up the branch in Kaada, the centre of most villages, would have made life easier for the people. Manbir Bohara, the ward chairman, said that after the Everest Bank refused to open a bank in the municipality's centre, citing insecurity and a poor road, it had to be established in Dhuli. A bank in the municipality, nonetheless, will be a big relief for many villagers. “Now that there is a bank branch in the municipality, it has become easier for individuals to do financial transactions,” said Bohara.It would facilitate the residents of wards 1 and 2, but according to locals, people in wards 3, 4, and 5 in the northern part of the district will still face problems.They said the elderly and others in the northern part of the district still have to walk for days to get the social security allowance. Bohara, however, said that the branch had only been opened and they were studying the residents’ issues. “We are discussing how to facilitate the distribution of social security allowance in the villages of Kaada, Nyuna, and Balodi.”After the bank came into operation, locals and associations of Dhuli started to open accounts.“We are happy to open the branch and provide services,\" said Ramkumar Thapa, head of the Saipal branch of the bank. \"Locals are also happy to see the bank, eight years after the country was federated.\"Thapa said that during the bank's initial operation, he received good support and feedback from the locals. The rural municipality has installed a 5-kilowatt solar plant worth about Rs1 million to power the bank. He, however, said there is a problem with the Internet, which fluctuates from time to time and hampers work.Seven years ago, the central bank asked Everest Bank to serve the Saipal rural municipality. The bank had been reluctant to establish the branch, citing poor infrastructure such as roads and communication, and security.The local people’s representatives visited Kathmandu many times, requesting the government to establish the branch.They have been criticising the government, saying that the people from the far-flung Saipal could not feel the presence of the local governing council in the absence of a bank or its branch. In March, a team led by Nepal Rastra Bank director Satyendra Timilsina, including Everest Bank deputy general manager Ashutosh Sharma and Everest Bank’s Bajhang branch chief Kumar Thing, reached Saipal for a field study.Based on the team’s recommendations, the government introduced a policy to establish the bank branch within this fiscal year. Since there were no banks or branches in the municipality, the Saipal municipal office has been renting a house in Chainpur, the district headquarters, to conduct financial transactions. Locals had to walk for two to four days to get a small recommendation to the district headquarters.When coming to the headquarters to negotiate and withdraw funds, the officials of the consumer committee used to claim the expenses of food, transportation and accommodation from the project budget, putting a dent on the funds set aside for specified works.For most consumer committees, signing a project agreement takes 6 to 12 days including the time taken to open an account and deposit the money. Years ago, locals protested for a long time when Kaada was annexed to the Talkot rural municipality, which would take three days to reach the municipality. The Everest Bank said there is a formal programme to open the first branch by Nepal Rastra Bank Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari. After its formal opening, discussions would be held on making the services easily available to the citizens in other remote areas, according to Everest Bank officials.

However, years later, thousands of people from across the country are getting infected with diarrheal diseases, including scores from cholera.Rautahat is among the nine districts reporting cholera outbreaks this year. Ward 4 of Rajpur Municipality has reported over 100 cases of diarrheal infection and hospitalisation. However, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said only 12 people from the municipality had so far contracted cholera.“Over 100 diarrheal patients from the municipality’s ward 4 have been hospitalised,” Khusid Ahmad, a health worker at the municipality, told the Post over the phone from Rautahat. “Contaminated drinking water could be the culprit for the cholera outbreak there. Samples of drinking water collected from affected areas have been sent for lab tests.”Apart from Rautahat, eight other districts—Lalitpur, Kathmandu, Kailali, Pyuthan, Makawanpur, Rolpa, Sindhupalchok, and Achham—have also reported cholera outbreaks this year. So far, the number of diarrheal patients who have contracted cholera is 95. Interestingly, most of the districts that have witnessed outbreaks of deadly cholera this year had years ago been declared open defecation-free.The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Doctors say that detected cases of cholera infection could be just the tip of the iceberg, as most positive cases are being reported from the districts with active surveillance.Public health experts say outbreaks of cholera in multiple districts, even five years after the country was declared open defecation-free, show a huge gap between official declarations and progress on the ground.They say outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, including cholera, are directly linked to drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, and the country was declared open defecation-free without improving water and sanitation conditions.“Without ensuring the quality of drinking water and sanitation, among other things, authorities rushed to declare the entire country free from open defecation,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Instead of improving basic water and sanitation infrastructure, we’ve focussed too much on outbreak management, and this is the wrong approach.”Even though toilets have been built in most households, open defecation is still widespread in many places. Drinking water samples collected from various parts of the country, including from the districts of the Kathmandu Valley, have been found contaminated with faecal coliform, which means the water the public uses for drinking is unsafe. The presence of faecal coliform, a microscopic organism that thrives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces, indicates sewage contamination in the drinking water, according to doctors.A previous study had shown that 81 percent of water samples collected in the Kathmandu Valley were contaminated with deadly microbes.“We only focussed on expanding coverage of drinking water but did not pay attention to ensuring its safety,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Authorities concerned must also focus on improving the quality.”Experts say improving public hygiene is essential to ensuring water quality and avoiding diarrheal ailments. Awareness drives and health education play a crucial role in changing behaviours, which requires years of investment and continuous efforts.Along with investment in health education, attention should go to building climate-resilient infrastructures for drinking water and sanitation, as water resources have been contaminated by floodwaters in many districts. The effects of climate change have increased adverse events, including floods, which in turn have contaminated the source of drinking water, making people vulnerable to infection with diarrheal ailments.“Multiple agencies of the three tiers of government and non-governmental sectors have to make more effort to prevent diarrhoea outbreaks,” said Sherpa. “But there seems to be a lack of coordination among government agencies.” The World Health Organisation also stresses on a multifaceted approach as a key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths.

The actual number of maternal deaths due to birth-related complications could be much higher, as maternal and perinatal death surveillance is being carried out in 51 districts only, officials say.“Maternal deaths from childbirth-related complications could be significantly underreported, as we are only tracking cases in 51 districts,” said Nisha Joshi, a public health official at the division. “We have no data on maternal and perinatal deaths in the rest of the districts.”In the fiscal year 2022-023, 191 maternal deaths were recorded across 49 districts. Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 239 per 100,000 births in 2016 to 151 per 100,000 in 2021, according to the national census carried out by the National Statistics Office. Earlier, the country had reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award. The health target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030.The latest census report has shown that 622 maternal deaths were recorded in a year. Officials at the Health Ministry concede that the number of deaths reported from 51 districts is only around 30 percent of the total maternal deaths occurring across the country.They complained that the lack of maternal and perinatal death surveillance programmes in all districts is the main reason for the underreporting of maternal deaths. “Due to budget constraints, we could not expand the maternal and perinatal death surveillance to other districts this year,” said Joshi. “We also have problems in the reporting system, and deaths that occur in villages of the districts without surveillance programmes go unreported.”Maternal health experts say that concerned authorities are keeping themselves in the dark by not conducting studies in all districts. “Without knowing the actual situation, effective planning is not possible, which means efforts to reduce ongoing deaths may not succeed,” said Dr Ganesh Dangal, a maternal health expert. A huge budget is not necessary to carry out death surveillance. So this programme should be enforced mandatorily in all districts immediately.”Maternal and perinatal death surveillance is a key intervention for improving maternal, perinatal, and neonatal survival rates. Experts say such surveillance provides an understanding of the number and causes of deaths, enabling more targeted and effective interventions.Nepal strives to reduce the deaths of mothers and babies. However, it lacks maternal and perinatal death surveillance in all districts.Perinatal death is the death of a baby between 22 weeks of gestation (or weighing 500g) and seven days after birth.The World Health Organisation said that maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response (MPDSR) is an essential quality improvement intervention, which permits the identification, notification, quantification and determination of causes and avoidability of maternal and neonatal deaths and stillbirth to orient the measures necessary for their prevention.According to the UN health body, systematic analyses of overall mortality trends and events and contributing factors leading to individual deaths can identify barriers in health systems and inspire local solutions to prevent such deaths in the future.Studies carried out in the past show that excessive bleeding after childbirth, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders) are some of the reasons for maternal deaths.The World Health Organisation said postpartum haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality in low-income countries and the primary cause of nearly a quarter of all maternal deaths globally. Most deaths resulting from the said complication occur during the first 24 hours after birth.Gynaecologists say tears in the cervix or tissues of the vagina, tear in a blood vessel in the uterus, bleeding in hidden tissue area or space in the pelvis, blood clotting disorders, and placenta problems are among the causes of postpartum haemorrhage.Every year, over 600,000 women deliver babies in Nepal.

Experts say such surveillance provides an understanding of the number and causes of deaths, enabling more targeted and effective interventions.Nepal strives to reduce the deaths of mothers and babies. However, it lacks maternal and perinatal death surveillance in all districts.Perinatal death is the death of a baby between 22 weeks of gestation (or weighing 500g) and seven days after birth.The World Health Organisation said that maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response (MPDSR) is an essential quality improvement intervention, which permits the identification, notification, quantification and determination of causes and avoidability of maternal and neonatal deaths and stillbirth to orient the measures necessary for their prevention.According to the UN health body, systematic analyses of overall mortality trends and events and contributing factors leading to individual deaths can identify barriers in health systems and inspire local solutions to prevent such deaths in the future.Studies carried out in the past show that excessive bleeding after childbirth, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders) are some of the reasons for maternal deaths.The World Health Organisation said postpartum haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality in low-income countries and the primary cause of nearly a quarter of all maternal deaths globally. Most deaths resulting from the said complication occur during the first 24 hours after birth.Gynaecologists say tears in the cervix or tissues of the vagina, tear in a blood vessel in the uterus, bleeding in hidden tissue area or space in the pelvis, blood clotting disorders, and placenta problems are among the causes of postpartum haemorrhage.Every year, over 600,000 women deliver babies in Nepal.

According to the World Health Organization, it is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, belonging to the same family as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The virus kills a third of those who fall ill and leaves up to half of those who survive with severe life-long disabilities, according to the UN health body.Officials say that September and October are the peak months for JE outbreaks.Health officials say this year’s death rate from the JE virus has exceeded 27 percent, and among the deceased, the number of children under 15 years of age is very high. Nepal has included the vaccine in its routine immunisation list, which the government provides free of cost to all children.The country started administering the vaccine doses in 2006, eight years before the World Health Organization officially issued prequalification certification, due to the high infection and deaths from the virus at the time. In 2005, JE killed nearly 2,000 people in Nepal—mostly children from the districts of Tarai region. In the first phase, all populations of the highly-affected four districts, Banke, Bardia, Dang, and Kailali, were inoculated with the JE vaccine. Later, the vaccination programme was expanded to 19 other affected districts, and children under 15 were inoculated.The government integrated the JE vaccine into the routine immunisation list in 2015. Even though the vaccine is included in the regular immunisation list, several people still die, and dozens get infected by the deadly virus every year.Data from the Health Ministry show that less than 50 percent of the infected patients were found inoculated with the vaccine.Doctors say the disease has no cure, so treatment focuses on managing symptoms. However, safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent infection. Health officials said they are aware of the deadly disease outbreak and have already started consulting aid agencies for help to finance the JE vaccination programme.However, officials at the Department of Health Services said that none of the donors have taken health officials' requests seriously or shown interest in supporting the immunisation drive.Public health experts say that this is the right time to vaccinate all those at risk. Even if the vaccine does not help in outbreak management, it provides immunity from future infections. The JE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Culex mosquitoes. Pigs and ducks are considered natural reservoirs of the virus.Doctors advise taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as using mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothes, and getting vaccinated if one lives in or is travelling to disease-endemic areas. They also stress the importance of awareness and timely treatment to prevent infections and deaths.An estimated 12.5 million people are thought to be at high risk of JE infection in Nepal.

Multiple doctors the Post talked to said that the number of people suffering from heavy metal has been rising of late.

The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon.

Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution.

It was the culmination of a rapid succession of strikes that have eliminated half of Hezbollah’s leadership council and decimated its top military command.In the days before and hours after Nasrallah’s killing, Reuters spoke to more than a dozen sources in Lebanon, Israel, Iran and Syria who provided details of the damage Israel has wrought on the powerful Shi’ite paramilitary group, including to its supply lines and command structure. All asked for anonymity to speak about sensitive matters.One source familiar with Israeli thinking told Reuters, less than 24 hours before the strike, that Israel has spent 20 years focusing intelligence efforts on Hezbollah and could hit Nasrallah when it wanted, including in the headquarters.The person called the intelligence “brilliant,” without providing details.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his close circle of ministers authorized the attack on Wednesday, two Israeli officials told Reuters. The attack took place while Netanyahu was in New York to speak at the U.N. General Assembly.Nasrallah had avoided public appearances since a previous 2006 war. He had long been vigilant, his movements were restricted and the circle of people he saw was very small, according to a source familiar with Nasrallah’s security arrangements. The assassination suggested his group had been infiltrated by informants for Israel, the source said.The Hezbollah leader had been even more cautious than usual since the Sept. 17 pager blasts, out of concern Israel would try to kill him, a security source familiar with the group’s thinking told Reuters a week ago, citing his absence from a commanders’ funeral and his pre-recording of a speech broadcast a few days before.Hezbollah’s media office did not respond to a request for comment for this story. US President Joe Biden on Saturday called Nasrallah’s killing “a measure of justice” for his many victims, and said the United States fully supported Israel’s right to defend itself against Iranian-backed groups.Israel says it carried out the hit on Nasrallah by dropping bombs on the underground headquarters below a residential building in southern Beirut.“This is a massive blow and intelligence failure for Hezbollah,” Magnus Ranstorp, a veteran Hezbollah expert at the Swedish Defence University. “They knew that he was meeting. He was meeting with other commanders. And they just went for him.”Including Nasrallah, Israel’s military says it has killed eight of Hezbollah’s nine most senior military commanders this year, mostly in the past week. These commanders led units ranging from the rocket division to the elite Radwan force.Around 1,500 Hezbollah fighters were maimed by the exploding pagers and walkie talkies on Sept. 17 and Sept. 18.On Saturday, Israel’s military spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani told reporters in a briefing that the military had “real-time” knowledge that Nasrallah and other leaders were gathering. Shoshani did not say how they knew, but said the leaders were meeting to plan attacks on Israel.Brigadier General Amichai Levin, commander of Israel’s Hatzerim Airbase, told reporters that dozens of munitions hit the target within seconds.“The operation was complex and was planned for a long time,” according to Levin.DEPLETEDHezbollah has shown the ability to replace commanders quickly, and Nasrallah’s cousin Hashem Safieddine, also a cleric who wears the black turban denoting descent from Islam’s Prophet Mohammed, has long been tipped as his successor.“You kill one, they get a new one,” said a European diplomat of the group’s approach.The group, whose name means Party of God, will fight on: by US and Israeli estimates it had some 40,000 fighters ahead of the current escalation, along with large weapons stockpiles and an extensive tunnel network near Israel’s border.Founded in Tehran in 1982, the Shi’ite paramilitary outfit is the most formidable member of Iran’s so-called Axis of Resistance of anti-Israel allied irregular forces, and a significant regional player in its own right.But it has been materially and psychologically weakened over the past 10 days.Thanks to decades of backing from Iran, prior to the current conflict Hezbollah was among the world’s most well-armed non-conventional armies, with an arsenal of 150,000 rockets, missiles and drones, according to US estimates.That is ten times the size of the armoury the group had in 2006, during its last war with Israel, according to Israeli estimates.Over the past year, even more weapons have flowed into Lebanon from Iran, along with significant amounts of financial aid, a source familiar with Hezbollah’s thinking said.There have been few detailed public assessments of how much this arsenal has been damaged by Israel’s offensive over the past week, which has hit Hezbollah strongholds in Bekka Valley, far from Lebanon’s border with Israel.One Western diplomat in the Middle East told Reuters prior to Friday’s attack that Hezbollah had lost 20%-25% of its missile capacity in the ongoing conflict, including in hundreds of Israeli strikes this week. The diplomat did not provide evidence or details of their assessment.An Israeli security official said “a very respectable portion” of Hezbollah’s missile stocks had been destroyed, without giving further specifics.In recent days, Israel has struck more than 1,000 Hezbollah targets. The security official, when asked about the military’s extensive target lists, said Israel had matched Hezbollah’s two-decade build up with preparations to prevent it launching its rockets in the first place - a complement to the Iron Dome air defence system that often downs missiles fired at the Jewish state.Israeli officials say the fact that Hezbollah has only been able to launch a couple of hundred missiles a day in the past week was evidence its capabilities had been diminished.IRAN CONNECTIONBefore the strike on Nasrallah, three Iranian sources told Reuters Iran was planning to send additional missiles to Hezbollah to prepare for a prolonged war.The weapons that were to be provided included short-to-medium-range ballistic missiles including Iranian Zelzals and an upgraded precision version known as the Fateh 110, the first Iranian source said.Reuters was unable to reach the sources after the Nasrallah assassination.While Iran is willing to provide military support, the two Iranian sources said it does not want to be directly involved in a confrontation between Hezbollah and Israel. The rapid escalation in hostilities over the past week follows a year of skirmishes tied to the Gaza war.Iranian Revolutionary Guards’ deputy commander Abbas Nilforoushan was killed in the Israeli strikes on Beirut on Friday, Iranian media reported on Saturday, citing a state TV report.Hezbollah may need certain warheads and missiles along with drones and missile parts to replenish those destroyed by Israeli strikes across Lebanon last week, a senior Syrian military intelligence source added.Iranian supplies have in the past reached Hezbollah by air and sea. On Saturday, Lebanon’s transport ministry told an Iranian aircraft not to enter its airspace after Israel warned air traffic control at Beirut airport that it would use “force” if the plane landed, a source at the ministry told Reuters.The source said it was not clear what was on the plane.Land corridors are currently the best route for missiles, parts and drones, through Iraq and Syria, with the help of allied armed groups in those countries, an Iranian security official told Reuters this week.The Syrian military source, however, said Israeli drone surveillance and strikes targeting convoys of trucks had compromised that route. This year, Israel stepped up attacks on weapons depots and supply routes in Syria to weaken Hezbollah ahead of any war, Reuters reported in June.As recently as August, an Israeli drone hit weapons concealed in commercial trailers in Syria, the source said. This week, Israel’s military said its warplanes bombed unspecified infrastructure used to transfer weapons to Hezbollah at the Syria-Lebanon border.Joseph Votel, a former army general who led US forces in the Middle East, said Israel and its allies could well intercept any missiles Iran sent by land to Hezbollah now.“That might be a risk they’re willing to take, frankly,” he said.

She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

To anyone following the episodic news outside the village, and in Kathmandu, the elephants are intruders from India, wild beasts with very little regard for human lives and livelihoods. The story is a little more complex than that. In the age of social media, the elephant menace gets ever so magnified. Short videos show villagers running helter-skelter: Helpless men, women and young children trying to chase the elephants away from their homes and crops howsoever they can. The human-animal conflict is never an easy sight. When the elephants then enter the neighbouring east Bihar, local communities in India similarly hold that the tusker trouble has its origin in Nepal. Most of these stories are reported as isolated events; so are the solutions that come into play. Villagers try to chase the elephants away from human settlements and keep vigil to bar them from re-entering their neighbourhoods. In 2016, the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), with support from the World Bank, constructed an 18-kilometre fence in Bahundangi, right by the Mechi River. But the electric fences can never offer a one-stop solution. Over time, elephants—among the most intelligent animals—find ways to circumvent them. Often, the fence is washed away by floods—as some 300 metres of it in the current monsoon in Bahundangi. In some cases, the solar-powered battery panels are stolen, which can render the fence useless. In all this, the only concern for many local government officials—the CDOs, Chief District Officers; and the DFOs, District Forest Officers in Chandragadhi, for instance—is to hush it all up. To them, the news of elephant attacks or elephants in distress should not travel to Kathmandu. Why face a new set of controversies, get caught up in the Centre-grassroots contest and invite needless enquiries? Any initiative that especially requires cross-border cooperation with Indian officials is even more complicated. What attracts the elephantsElephants can smell maize from miles away and farmers in Jhapa grow plenty of it. Various hybrid varieties now grow abundantly round the year, very unlike earlier when it used to be a seasonal crop. On the other hand, the Darjeeling Terai and further east, the Dooars, are studded with large tea gardens—among the world’s largest. Elephants don’t eat tea plants, but the tea gardens along the foothills of the Himalaya are havens for elephants in their long migration routes in the plains of Bengal, southern Bhutan and Assam.The elephant corridors in eastern Nepal and north Bengal, on the Indian Chicken Neck, are crucial conduits for their movements. The Mahananda-Kolabari corridor links the forests of Bengal to Nepal. However, as water holes, grass, and trees get scarce, elephants venture into human settlements in search of food and water.Further, as the temperatures warm up due to global warming, elephant sightings have been reported at higher elevations in Ilam, which borders the Darjeeling Hills. Among the wild elephants spotted in the elephant corridor in Jhapa, Morang and Sunsari, some are local herds (raithaney), which have been found to stay there for extended periods.Borderland and nonstate actorsBahundangi notably is in the borderland. Family and kinship ties, and businesses are spread across the border to Panitanki, Siliguri, Darjeeling and beyond. When elephants create menace and run into trouble in the settlements close to the Nepal-India border, it is the Rapid Response Team that springs into action, often in the middle of the night. Its members are residents of local communities on either side of the border river. The locals are in the line of fire, and they are the ones who get into immediate action. Kathmandu, Biratnagar and even Chandragadhi are distant administrative capitals. In north Bengal, adjacent to eastern Jhapa, the elephant habitat lies in Darjeeling Terai and Jalpaiguri districts. The elephant population extends from the Teesta River char (sand and silt islands in the river formed by floods) through Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary and southern forests of Kurseong Division, up to Bahundangi, observes Jayanta Mallick in ‘Trans-boundary human-elephant conflict in the Indo-Nepal Terai landscape’. Increasingly, the landscape, interspersed with human habitations, has become an extensive human-elephant conflict zone in terms of human mortality, crop depredations and loss of properties. In Nepal, elephant populations are concentrated in four places. Bahundangi is the transit point for migration in the east. Nepal has enlisted elephants as protected species under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1973 and is among the 13 Asian elephant range states.A ‘mega-herbivore,’ elephants have long-range dispersing behaviour, frequently coming into contact with human beings in the course of their movement. Although their poaching is not a threat in Nepal, according to the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NNTC), elephant conservation is challenged by habitat fragmentation, obstruction of migratory routes and human-elephant conflict. Though the challenge of elephant conservation has been documented in academic essays and journals, its cross-border nuances are not much discussed in the public sphere. Elephants as far away as Assam migrate to Nepal, passing through the plains of Darjeeling. In the process, they pass through human settlements, where they damage houses and crops, kill humans and get killed themselves too.Without a cross-border conservation regime and recognition of the role of non-state actors, such as the Rapid Response Team in Bahundangi and Naxalbari in north Bengal, the human-animal conflict will continue to be grossly misunderstood.   ","summary":"Bang on the banks of the Mechi River, Bahundangi gets in the news each time elephants “wreak havoc” in the village in eastern Jhapa, on the border with the Darjeeling Terai.

Citing safety concerns, over the past 22 years, hundreds of families have sought a way out of the national park. Yet they don’t know where to go or what to do next. Shuklaphanta is an example of a recurring national problem. Every year, disasters, both natural and manmade, leave thousands of Nepali families without proper shelters. Seldom has the state taken an initiative for their quick and proper rehabilitation. What’s at stake is the security and well-being of the displaced people. Temporary shelters and settlement areas are not as protective as permanent ones, leaving those displaced from Shuklaphanta vulnerable to the attacks of wild animals and other natural calamities. Dealing with wild animals in the national park has become a daily struggle. And their settlement in the conservation area has also proved detrimental to wildlife. Following last year’s Jajarkot earthquake, hundreds of families had to put up in temporary huts. Come monsoon, things only got worse, holed up as they were in their leaky tents. Lest we forget, during winter, many earthquake victims died due to cold. Pretty much the same could now be true in the case of those displaced by the wildlife reserve. Over the years, multiple judicial commissions—33 in total—have been formed in Sudurpaschim province to address the Shuklaphanta rehabilitation issue. Yet none has done anything substantive other than count the number of displaced families—1,480 of them. But a coordinator for the displaced families claims the number is 2,473, accusing the commission of deliberately downplaying the number of the displaced. Similar inefficiencies plague disaster rehabilitation efforts across the country. Discrepancies in government records and actual numbers often result in relief materials either failing to reach the needy or piling up unused. As concerning is the disappearance of funds meant for rehabilitation programmes. Even after the 2015 earthquake, many donor agencies were concerned that corruption would hamper rebuilding—and it did. The 30th commission in Shuklaphanta proposed to provide each displaced family with 0.338 hectares of land or Rs6 million in compensation. But that recommendation was never seriously considered. As a result, the victims have long lost faith in these commissions. It is thus vital that any new initiative be taken only after gaining the victims’ trust. Rehabilitation of course isn’t something that can be done in haste. It takes time and thought-out measures. Yet proper rehabilitation is seldom the state’s priority, as those in the government prefer to try out much easier temporary fixes rather than rigorously work on the same issue for months or even years on end. The displaced individuals, who are already mentally and physically traumatised, shouldn’t have to suffer more. Each and every Nepali has the constitutional right to live with dignity and it is the state’s responsibility to ensure the same.

Really, a government that is incapable of looking after its weak and vulnerable people does not deserve to be called democratic.  "},{"hash":"de90890d2aa2dafeaf41db7a2b5b11d4e14f8a92aca74a0096c9c76234a3fa30","title":"costly-festivals","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/09/25/costly-festivals","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/edtrlshutterstock-1727282938.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1727222400000,"source":"kp","category":"editorial","content":"Every year, on the eve of Dashain, Tihar and Chhath, the triumvirate of Nepal’s biggest festivals, market prices shoot up, shadowing the festive mood.

To make matters worse, both long-range buses and airlines hike ticket prices, making the journey home a financial burden for many. Goods prices are really not consumer-friendly. Even the supposedly low-cost goods from China are now out of reach of many families. Let us not even get started on the price of gold, which only the super-rich can now afford. While it is natural for international trends to influence market prices, the bigger problem in Nepal are opportunistic traders and middlemen who are freely fleecing consumers in the absence of proper market supervision. Take the recent price hike in edible oil. When India, Nepal’s all-important trade partner, increased the basic import tax on crude and edible oils by 25 percent, Nepali importers seized on the opportunity to increase the price of edible oil, even when the government of Nepal had not increased its import taxes on oil. As a result, sunflower oil, which was Rs190 a litre last week, is now being sold at Rs210 a litre; mustard oil, which was going at Rs350 a litre, now costs Rs370 for the same amount. Rice prices have also increased by an average of Rs100kg (for a 25 kg bag). In the next few weeks, the prices could get steeper still. In response, the government has started operating fair-priced shops across the country to help people tide over festive times.

Only if there is periodic monitoring of the market will the effort seem credible and businesses take it seriously. Moreover, according to consumer rights activists, just inspecting retail markets is not enough. To prevent unscrupulous trade, the warehouses of larger importers and traders where goods are stocked for supply must also come under regular inspections.Then there is the matter of added travel costs. Domestic flight fares rise due to increased demand during festivals. For instance, the usual one-way airfare for Kathmandu-Dhangadhi is Rs7,900, but travellers will have to pay Rs13,300 between October 10-12 this year. Those who book tickets ahead of time get to travel on the standard fare, but those in emergencies are bound to suffer. Travel via the roads is another concern during festivals as the transport management department, which has issued directives for safe and comfortable travel, has refused to increase the number of passenger buses. This has allowed the current bus operators to overcharge passengers. Ease of travel is a basic right and it cannot be solely left to the logic of supply and demand, especially during the festive times when all people long to be with their loved ones. Several studies, including one by the National Consumer Forum, a consumer rights body, reckon Nepal’s market is comparably more expensive than markets of similar economies.

The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority.

The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority.
