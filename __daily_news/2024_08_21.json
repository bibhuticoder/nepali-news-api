The KP Sharma Oli administration now wants to allow TikTok to operate with a slew of regulatory changes. Despite the public holiday, the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology held an hour-long meeting on Tuesday to decide the fate of TikTok in Nepal. Observers say the TikTok issue is global and at the centre of a geopolitical contest between the US and China. TikTok's South Asia division emailed the Minister for Communication and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung, ten days ago, requesting that the ban be lifted as it would follow the country's all rules and regulations. Gurung, however, declined to comment.The government restricted TikTok after introducing the ‘Directives on the Operation of Social Networking 2023’ in November last year.The directives made it mandatory for social media sites such as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and YouTube, among others, to open liaison offices in Nepal.The government said the measure was introduced because an increasing number of people were complaining that the absence of the companies’ representatives in Nepal made it difficult for the authorities to address their users’ concerns and even remove objectionable content from the platforms.The directives include a 19-point not-to-do list for users on platforms like Facebook, X, TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram.The directives say no one should create fake IDs on social media or share or make comments through such IDs. Likewise, people should not post any text, audio, video or picture that spreads hatred against any gender, community, caste, religion, profession, or people from any particular group.The new rule also bars any post promoting wrong activities such as child labour, human trafficking, child marriage or polygamy.“Now, the letter emailed by the Policy Committee Division of South Asia office of TikTok has said it is committed to follow all the rules and regulations,” said a top official at the ministry, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.“The government is positive.”The ministry is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to discuss the issue further.“The agenda regarding lifting the ban will then go to the Cabinet seeking its approval in principle,” the official added.He said the exact date to lift the ban is unknown, but the upcoming Cabinet will decide on it.TikTok has written seven letters to the Nepal government requesting to lift the ban before.In the letter, TikTok says that the ban is causing financial losses to the country and the company. Another official at the ministry, requesting anonymity, told the Post that the government has been responding to TikTok, saying that the loss is one part, but rules and regulations are important.After the ban, people started using TikTok by installing a virtual private network (VPN) to bypass local censorship. But gradually, most of them have switched to Facebook and Instagram reels, which allow users to film or upload video clips. Sudhir Parajuli, president of the Internet Service Providers’ Association of Nepal, said that people downloaded VPNs immediately after the TikTok ban, which increased international bandwidth consumption by 20 percent. “As most users access TikTok via VPN, it didn’t impact the business much.”VPN establishes a digital connection between a computer and a remote server owned by a VPN provider, creating a point-to-point tunnel that encrypts the user’s personal data, masks the internet protocol address and sidesteps website blocks and firewalls on the internet.Internet service providers said that TikTok accounts for nearly 40 percent of internet bandwidth consumption in Nepal. When it is banned, internet consumption does not decline due to the use of VPN. Before the ban, the association said there were around 2.2 million TikTok users in Nepal.Following the government decision, two telecommunications service providers—Nepal Telecom and Ncell—and more than 30 internet service providers blocked TikTok.The former government's decision to ban TikTok was widely criticised by experts and the public, who cited it as an attack on freedom of expression and speech.Internet experts said that it is difficult to ban technology.

The bill that is under consideration in the National Assembly lists rape or serious sexual violence, intentional or arbitrary killing, enforced disappearance, provided that the victim’s whereabouts remains unknown; and inhuman or cruel torture as serious violations of human rights hence non-amenstiable. The categorisation, according to the three organisations, are not consistent with international law and exclude other serious crimes. They claim that the prohibition of torture and the requirement that it be criminalised is absolute and there can be no qualification for “inhuman or cruel” torture, since torture by its nature is inhuman or cruel.The bill also requires that both categories of violations (defined as “serious” and not)—except for rape and “serious sexual violence”—are committed in a targeted or planned manner against an unarmed individual or community. “This could exclude many cases not only from any criminal accountability but also other measures under the bill, such as civil and administrative remedies and reparations,” reads the statement. “These provisions create a large accountability gap for many crimes under international law, including possible crimes against humanity and war crimes, contrary to Nepal’s Constitution and its international legal obligations.”The human rights bodies too have found a serious flaw in the provision that allows a 75 percent reduction in the sentencing for those convicted of serious violations if they cooperate in the investigation process.This provision, amounting to a disguised amnesty, contradicts the principle that criminal sanctions must be proportionate to the gravity of the crime, and also undermines the fundamental role and competency of the judiciary, they claim. Like different victims organisations, they argue it should be the prerogative of the court to decide what reduction may be appropriate.The House of Representatives on August 14 endorsed the bill with the support from all the parties, but the Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party, which has only one seat in the 275-member House of Representatives, and forwarded to the upper house. It has already been tabled in the upper chamber which is expected to decide on the bill on Thursday. As the bill is still under consideration in one of the two Houses of the federal parliament, the human rights organisations have said to ensure the integrity of the process and bring the law into compliance with Nepali and international legal standards, serious accountability gaps need to be addressed by lawmakers. Also, all institutions involved in the administration of justice—including the courts, transitional justice commissions, and the Attorney General—should make sure to construe the bill in accordance with international law and the Constitution of Nepal.A group of victims, writing to the National Assembly chairperson, have urged him to rectify the problematic provisions in the bill before endorsing it. “We victims organisations request you and the lawmakers in the National Assembly to revise the flawed provisions in the bill before endorsement,” reads their letter.Similarly, the three human rights bodies have said the new law can be an opportunity to finally deliver justice for victims, strengthen the rule of law, and create a positive precedent for the region. “This should not turn into yet another exercise in which victims are encouraged to accept compensation without truth and justice,” Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, was quoted as saying in the statement. The Supreme Court in 2015 had turned down several amnesty provisions in the Act terming them unconstitutional and in violation of Nepal’s international human rights obligations. While the new bill includes several significant improvements and positive provisions, parts again appear designed to shield those responsible for wartime crimes from prosecution, said the international human rights watchdogs.“Victims have been waiting for full acknowledgement of the harms they have suffered and reparations for almost 20 years. For a transitional justice process to accomplish its aims, all of the five essential pillars of this process—truth, justice, reparation, memorialisation, and guarantees of non-recurrence—must be pursued,” Mandira Sharma, senior international legal adviser at the ICJ, was quoted as saying. “Current gaps in this law could serve to threaten the outcome of the process and defeat the purpose of providing effective remedies to victims.”Stating that the transitional justice commissions in the past failed to win the trust of victims due to repeated political interference in the appointment of the commissioners, Smriti Singh, South Asia director at Amnesty International said, “The commissioners must be trusted by victims’ groups for their work to be effective and credible.

Alongside drafting its report, the committee has been interrogating those accused in the scam and suspects held in police custody across the country. “Until now, we have interrogated 28 people connected in the cooperatives scam, with 17 in custody,” Ishwari Devi Neupane, a committee member, told the Post. According to her, the committee has been interrogating those accused in the scam since it decided on August 6 to summon individuals including former deputy prime minister and home minister Rabi Lamichhane, who is also the president of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). “The committee is planning to record Lamichhane’s statement soon. But we have yet to issue a formal notice for his appearance,” Sarita Bhusal, a committee member, told the Post. He might be summoned by the end of this week, she suggested. “Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi, the original founders of the Gorkha Media Network, are accused of channeling cooperatives funds to the media company that operated Galaxy 4K Television [now defunct], so we intend to question them together once we have summoned others involved in scam,” Neupane added.Another committee member, Lekhnath Dahal, also said that the date to call Lamichhane has not been fixed though it is likely that he will be summoned by August 23.“However, whether Lamichhane will be called that day or not will be determined by the availability of Chhabilal Joshi,” Dahal told the Post. “Joshi currently is performing the ritual following the death of his mother which will be over on August 22.”On Sunday, the parliamentary committee recorded the statement of Bipin Acharya, joint-secretary of the RSP. Acharya, who was creative director of the Gorkha Media Network, was interrogated at the committee’s secretariat in Singha Durbar on Sunday. Acharya, along with RSP president Lamichhane, is alleged to have been involved in embezzling funds from multiple cooperatives established under the leadership of Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, who also chaired the media company.While recording his statement, Acharya, however, denied his involvement in the cooperative scam, Dahal said. “During the investigation, we found Rs120 million to have been rerouted to his account from different cooperatives, but Acharya claims he is unaware of where the money in his bank account came from.” The preliminary finding shows RSP chief Lamichhane’s involvement in cooperatives-related issues, Dahal added. “But, we need to wait for the final report to conclude whether his involvement was legal or not.”The committee also quizzed several individuals who are in judicial custody on charges of embezzling deposits from cooperatives. Members of the probe said they are in the final phase of summoning the people from judicial custody. To date, the committee has brought Sudhir Basnet, who was chair of Oriental Cooperatives; former lawmaker Ichha Raj Tamang, who was chair of Civil Cooperatives; and Krishna Bahadur Upreti, chair of Ideal Namuna Cooperatives, to its meetings and interrogated them on the issue. All of them are in custody.Likewise, police have summoned Kumar Ramtel, Bhabeshwar Aryal, Shiva Kumar Gurung, and Kalpana Shrestha of the Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Cooperatives for interrogation. They were brought from the custody in Pokhara to Kathmandu for the purpose. Om Prakash Gurung, chair of the Supreme Cooperatives, Butwal, was also brought to Kathmandu from Bhairahawa Prison. The committee also interrogated Dipesh Kumar Pun, the former secretary of the Supreme Cooperatives, Butwal. Pun is the son of former Vice President Nanda Bahadur Pun. As per the committee’s terms of reference, investigators will look into the scams related to 29 cooperatives. Twenty of them are listed in Schedule 1 while nine are in Schedule 2.Those listed under Schedule 2 of the ToR are: the Ideal Yamuna Multipurpose Cooperative, the Image Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sahara Saving and Cooperative, the Samanta Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Suryadarshan Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sumeru Saving and Credit Cooperative, and the Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative. Cooperatives from where they rerouted money to the Gorkha Media Network come under Schedule 2 of the ToR. After Gorkha Media Network office bearers were accused of involvement in the embezzlement of cooperatives money, depositors of various cooperatives whose money was rerouted to the media company had asked the law enforcement agencies to book the culprits under the law. Lamichhane was the managing director at the media company that operated the now-shuttered Galaxy 4K broadcaster before joining politics and launching the RSP under his leadership in June 2022. Lamichhane held 15 percent shares in the media company as its managing director. Amid accusations of defrauding millions of rupees from several cooperatives, Lamichhane, also the RSP president, repeatedly claimed that he doesn’t have accounts in any of the cooperatives, and hence, there is no question of his involvement in embezzling the deposits.Lamichhane claims he was just an employee of the media company and did not know how its funds were arranged for. He argues that he cannot be held accountable for the investments and loans involving the now defunct company and its chair, GB Rai.The Company Act 2006, Section 2(j), defines Lamichhane's position (managing director) as an ‘Officer’ of the company’s corporate body.According to the Act, the ‘Officer’ of a company signifies a director, chief executive, manager, company secretary, liquidator, or any employee undertaking departmental responsibility of the company as its officer.While the Company Act 2006 mentions the managing director as an officer of a company, the National Penal Act 2017 states that the managing director is a responsible person who should be held accountable should the company commit any crime falling within the scope of his/her authority.Section 30 of the National Penal (Code) Act 2017 states that criminal liability for an offence committed by a corporate body [legal entity with separate legal existence from a company’s members or shareholders] is vested in one who commits or causes the commission of the act.“Where any firm, company, or body corporate commits, or causes the commission of, an act considered to be an offence under this Act or law, the person who committed, or caused the commission of, such offence shall be responsible for such act,” the clause reads.“Where such a person cannot be identified… in case of a firm, the director, managing director, or general manager who did or caused such an act… and where even such a person cannot be identified, the chief executive of such a body shall bear the criminal liability,” it says.While Lamichhane claims that he was only an employee at the company, Advocate Om Prakash Aryal said that the provisions mentioned earlier hold Lamichhane accountable for the company’s decisions to get loans from the cooperatives because he was the company's managing director at the time.The committee was formed on May 28 after the Nepali Congress repeatedly obstructed parliamentary proceedings, demanding parliamentary probe.

But we have yet to issue a formal notice for his appearance,” Sarita Bhusal, a committee member, told the Post. He might be summoned by the end of this week, she suggested. “Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi, the original founders of the Gorkha Media Network, are accused of channeling cooperatives funds to the media company that operated Galaxy 4K Television [now defunct], so we intend to question them together once we have summoned others involved in scam,” Neupane added.Another committee member, Lekhnath Dahal, also said that the date to call Lamichhane has not been fixed though it is likely that he will be summoned by August 23.“However, whether Lamichhane will be called that day or not will be determined by the availability of Chhabilal Joshi,” Dahal told the Post. “Joshi currently is performing the ritual following the death of his mother which will be over on August 22.”On Sunday, the parliamentary committee recorded the statement of Bipin Acharya, joint-secretary of the RSP. Acharya, who was creative director of the Gorkha Media Network, was interrogated at the committee’s secretariat in Singha Durbar on Sunday. Acharya, along with RSP president Lamichhane, is alleged to have been involved in embezzling funds from multiple cooperatives established under the leadership of Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, who also chaired the media company.While recording his statement, Acharya, however, denied his involvement in the cooperative scam, Dahal said. “During the investigation, we found Rs120 million to have been rerouted to his account from different cooperatives, but Acharya claims he is unaware of where the money in his bank account came from.” The preliminary finding shows RSP chief Lamichhane’s involvement in cooperatives-related issues, Dahal added. “But, we need to wait for the final report to conclude whether his involvement was legal or not.”The committee also quizzed several individuals who are in judicial custody on charges of embezzling deposits from cooperatives. Members of the probe said they are in the final phase of summoning the people from judicial custody. To date, the committee has brought Sudhir Basnet, who was chair of Oriental Cooperatives; former lawmaker Ichha Raj Tamang, who was chair of Civil Cooperatives; and Krishna Bahadur Upreti, chair of Ideal Namuna Cooperatives, to its meetings and interrogated them on the issue. All of them are in custody.Likewise, police have summoned Kumar Ramtel, Bhabeshwar Aryal, Shiva Kumar Gurung, and Kalpana Shrestha of the Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Cooperatives for interrogation. They were brought from the custody in Pokhara to Kathmandu for the purpose. Om Prakash Gurung, chair of the Supreme Cooperatives, Butwal, was also brought to Kathmandu from Bhairahawa Prison. The committee also interrogated Dipesh Kumar Pun, the former secretary of the Supreme Cooperatives, Butwal. Pun is the son of former Vice President Nanda Bahadur Pun. As per the committee’s terms of reference, investigators will look into the scams related to 29 cooperatives. Twenty of them are listed in Schedule 1 while nine are in Schedule 2.Those listed under Schedule 2 of the ToR are: the Ideal Yamuna Multipurpose Cooperative, the Image Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sahara Saving and Cooperative, the Samanta Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Suryadarshan Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sumeru Saving and Credit Cooperative, and the Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative. Cooperatives from where they rerouted money to the Gorkha Media Network come under Schedule 2 of the ToR. After Gorkha Media Network office bearers were accused of involvement in the embezzlement of cooperatives money, depositors of various cooperatives whose money was rerouted to the media company had asked the law enforcement agencies to book the culprits under the law. Lamichhane was the managing director at the media company that operated the now-shuttered Galaxy 4K broadcaster before joining politics and launching the RSP under his leadership in June 2022. Lamichhane held 15 percent shares in the media company as its managing director. Amid accusations of defrauding millions of rupees from several cooperatives, Lamichhane, also the RSP president, repeatedly claimed that he doesn’t have accounts in any of the cooperatives, and hence, there is no question of his involvement in embezzling the deposits.Lamichhane claims he was just an employee of the media company and did not know how its funds were arranged for. He argues that he cannot be held accountable for the investments and loans involving the now defunct company and its chair, GB Rai.The Company Act 2006, Section 2(j), defines Lamichhane's position (managing director) as an ‘Officer’ of the company’s corporate body.According to the Act, the ‘Officer’ of a company signifies a director, chief executive, manager, company secretary, liquidator, or any employee undertaking departmental responsibility of the company as its officer.While the Company Act 2006 mentions the managing director as an officer of a company, the National Penal Act 2017 states that the managing director is a responsible person who should be held accountable should the company commit any crime falling within the scope of his/her authority.Section 30 of the National Penal (Code) Act 2017 states that criminal liability for an offence committed by a corporate body [legal entity with separate legal existence from a company’s members or shareholders] is vested in one who commits or causes the commission of the act.“Where any firm, company, or body corporate commits, or causes the commission of, an act considered to be an offence under this Act or law, the person who committed, or caused the commission of, such offence shall be responsible for such act,” the clause reads.“Where such a person cannot be identified… in case of a firm, the director, managing director, or general manager who did or caused such an act… and where even such a person cannot be identified, the chief executive of such a body shall bear the criminal liability,” it says.While Lamichhane claims that he was only an employee at the company, Advocate Om Prakash Aryal said that the provisions mentioned earlier hold Lamichhane accountable for the company’s decisions to get loans from the cooperatives because he was the company's managing director at the time.The committee was formed on May 28 after the Nepali Congress repeatedly obstructed parliamentary proceedings, demanding parliamentary probe.

He planned to move in with four friends after finishing his exams and came across an enticing offer through WhatsApp: a three-room flat in New Baneshwar for just Rs8,000 a month.Initially sceptical, Mahesh was eventually persuaded by the purported landlord, who even sent videos of the furnished apartment. However, by the time Mahesh arrived in Kathmandu, having paid the full advance of three months’ rent plus additional security charges, the flat owner has been completely contactless.“I feel frustrated and ashamed,” Mahesh says. “My parents are farmers, and we’re just a middle-class family. I don’t know how to tell them or my friends that I lost their money.”Mahesh’s frustration is not unique. In recent years, the number of people who have fallen prey to scams carried out via online mediums, including hacking and cyber harassment, is on the rise.Data from Nepal’s Cyber Bureau shows that in the fiscal year 2022-23, a total of 9,013 cybercrime cases were reported. Out of these, 1,835 were related to online fraud, accounting for 20.35 percent of the total cases. In 2023-24, the number more than doubled, skyrocketing to 19,730. The surge in online fraud cases is equally concerning, with 4,112 cases registered, making up 20.84 percent of the total.The data reflects an alarming trend that shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, the current fiscal year 2024-25 has already seen 2,100 cases registered within the first month. And on the face of it, Nepal appears critically ill-prepared to tackle the growing challenges of cyber threats.According to Superintendent of Police Deepak Raj Awasthi, spokesperson and information officer of the Cyber Bureau, the highest crimes are related to hacking, which now accounts for around 52 percent of the total cybercrime cases. “Cybercrime cases are increasing at a very fast rate, but our resources to solve the problem haven’t improved much,” says Awasthi. The bureau remains woefully understaffed and underfunded. Out of the 106 personnel at the Cyber Bureau, only 28 are dedicated to the IT department tasked with solving cases.On June 26, 2023, the Ministry of Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs issued a notice in the Nepal Gazette, outlining plans for cyber-related crimes to be addressed in all districts.But the lower-level courts across districts are struggling to manage these cases due to a shortage of specialised technical expertise, certified professionals, and trained personnel.As a result, most cases across the country continue to be transferred to the Cyber Bureau at Bhotahity, straining its already limited resources.In a press release dated August 18, the Cyber Bureau warned the public about the increasing misuse of digital platforms, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to create and spread misleading or harmful content. The notice, while informative, highlights the growing challenges in policing cyberspace—a space that is becoming increasingly hostile for the unwary.According to the bureau, one of the biggest challenges in addressing the surge in cybercrime is the lack of budgetary resources. Another is their inability to trace the groups responsible for online fraud and scams for a lack of necessary investigative tools and resources to determine where and to whom the data collected through fraudulent apps is being transmitted, making it difficult to identify the root source of these crimes, Awasthi says.He also emphasised that the current IT department staff is insufficient. With the growing use of AI, cryptocurrency, and deepfake technology, IT and human resources must be equipped with the necessary skills and investigative tools to tackle the rising number of cases.“There needs to be an update in laws and policies to deal with cybercrime cases,” says Awasthi. “Currently, we operate under the Electronic Transaction Act, but we urgently need specific legislation that categorises different types of cybercrimes. Our IT department also needs more personnel, better training, and access to advanced investigative tools.”While cases involving AI are still categorised under morphing, Awasthi acknowledges that AI-driven scams are of growing concern. “We’ve encountered instances where perpetrators use apps with built-in AI, but we haven’t yet seen direct use of advanced AI software,” he says. “However, it’s only a matter of time before these cases become more prevalent.”The most common platforms for online fraud in Nepal have been Telegram and WhatsApp, with Telegram leading in reported cases. Investment scams, lottery scams, and romance/sex scams are among the most prevalent, with investment scams being the most reported.The Cyber Bureau’s website lists several common scams, including flat rental frauds like the one that ensnared Mahesh. These scams often involve asking for an advance payment for a room or flat, after which the scammer becomes unreachable. Other scams include online shopping fraud, employment fraud, and inheritance scams.In January 2024, Nepal had 15.40 million internet users, with an internet penetration rate of 49.6 percent of the total population, according to DataReportal. As Nepal’s digital landscape continues expanding so do the risks of cybercrime, as shown by reports from the Cyber Bureau.The gap between the escalating cyber threats and Nepal’s limited resources and preparedness is a critical risk to the country’s future digital security and literacy.Awasthi also suggests that establishing well-equipped and well-resourced mechanisms would alleviate the pressure on the Nepal Cyber Bureau in Kathmandu, making it easier to manage the growing number of cases across the country. “We’re doing our best with the resources we have,” he says. “But it’s clear that we need to expand our capabilities to keep up with the evolving threats in cyberspace.” ","summary":"On the afternoon of August 17, Mahesh stepped out of the exam hall at Modern Secondary School in Bhaktapur, exhausted but relieved after completing a gruelling three-hour MBBS entrance exam.As he exited the gate, his first instinct was not to call his family with the good news, but rather to reach out to someone saved in his phone contacts as ‘Flat Owner.’ For the next ten minutes, Mahesh, who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy reasons, stood by the school gate, repeatedly dialling the number with no success.This was not just another phone call—it was a desperate attempt to recover the Rs20,000 he had been scammed out of in a flat rental fraud.Mahesh’s ordeal began two months ago when he began looking for affordable housing in Kathmandu.

The Home Ministry had announced that the directive would be enforced in 28 districts, setting a deadline of mid-July. This decision had “terrorised people”, as they feared they would be deprived of social security services, and many registered in haste.But the government last month decided to overturn the directive with equal haste. Now, the Nepalis are left confused: To obtain it or not to obtain it? Seemingly disbelieving the government's changing position on the use of the NID, over half a million people opted for it between mid-June to mid-July. Yet, there is little information about whether the government has worked out the behind-the-scenes procedures for its proper utility. Despite the NID’s design to combine important identity cards and documents including driving licenses, academic documents, voting cards, insurance details, and ATM card numbers in a single chip, implementing agencies still lack the infrastructure for such an endeavour. This technological hurdle adds to the already challenging task of fully executing the NID card campaign six years after the government started distributing it. Moreover, the hubbub surrounding the NID’s “revolutionary” function has proven to be dubious—it is either of no use or is imposed arbitrarily on the people. This is a prime example of how our authorities care not to think about its citizens' comfort or welfare when they come up with new policies or schemes. The authorities' main argument for implementing the NID is that it will be a one-stop solution for surveilling and controlling criminal activities like financial fraud by removing duplication. Article 51 of the Constitution of Nepal 2015 pledges to develop an integrated national identity management information system and manage citizens' data. The NID and Registration Act 2020 states that personal privacy would be ensured in its usage. But experts believe the document has several loopholes as it does not discuss data protection. Sensitive data and information of the citizens are the nation's assets, and they must be safeguarded diligently. However, the government is yet to fully assure citizens about data privacy; what is working in the government’s favour is that many lack digital literacy enough to know about their privacy rights. Moreover, the government has not clearly explained how it plans to segregate information access by multiple agencies, as the NID provides an integrated database of different information. This paints a murky picture of Nepal’s cyber security ecosystem, as data security is fragile, and hackers often target government websites. Ever since the launch of the Adhaar Card in India, there have been numerous cases of duping, misuse and information leak. The government must learn from the mistakes of its next-door neighbour before launching a “grand” campaign to digitalise identification. The government would do well to return to the basics before taking any further steps and clearly address the concerns of experts, lawmakers and citizens about why and how the card is an important addition to other identifications like citizenship, driving license, and passport. Moreover, the authorities should first ideate on the utility, functionality and safety of the NID before imposing it on the citizens.  ","summary":"In June, when the Cabinet decided to make National Identity Card (NID) mandatory for accessing government services, including social security allowances, it was widely criticised, with even federal lawmakers voicing their disapproval.

Article 235 of the Constitution grants the federal parliament the authority to draft the necessary coordination law to maintain coordination among the federal units. In line with this directive, the “Federation, Province, and Local Level (Coordination and Interrelation) Act, 2020 (2077),” commonly known as the Intergovernmental Relations (IGR) Law, was enacted.The primary purpose of the IGR law is to strengthen the federal system by fostering coordination and cooperation in areas such as law and policy formulation. As Nepal transitioned from a centralised system to a federal structure, laws were critical to facilitate this transition and address people’s aspirations following the new constitution. To bridge this gap and ensure that the newly established three tiers of government function in accordance with the spirit of the constitution, the federal government introduced the IGR law. The law has become one of the most widely discussed pieces of legislation.However, Nepal embraced federalism without fully developing the necessary infrastructure and groundwork for its effective implementation. This decision has led to ongoing challenges, as political parties and their leaders have differing interpretations of federalism from the outset. These differences became apparent soon after the first government was elected in 2017, accompanying the federalism. Despite the constitutional provisions agreed upon by all political parties, implementation has been walking at a snail’s pace, with some provisions still unfulfilled.This has raised concerns, particularly as provincial governments have been demanding their rights from the federal government. Local governments, which had already established their bases and were revived nearly after two decades of dormancy with extensive rights, are now neglected.IGR lawThe implementation of the IGR law has begun, with major provisions gradually coming into effect. However, the process has been hindered by a centralised mindset, sluggish bureaucracy and political meddling.While all federal units have widely accepted the IGR law, the primary concern lies in its effective implementation and the devolution of power. The law’s main objective is to facilitate the implementation of constitutional provisions related to power sharing among the three tiers of government. A detailed analysis reveals that many of the law’s key provisions have only been partially implemented, highlighting the urgent need for a robust mechanism to ensure that all structures envisioned by the law are fully functional.Leaders holding executive positions at the federal level have been reluctant to devolve exclusive powers to the sub-federal levels. This reluctance, driven by a desire to retain power at the federal level, has significantly impeded the proper implementation of constitutional provisions and laws intended to strengthen inter-governmental relations. Additionally, the stakeholders’ lack of ownership has further obstructed the process. For the proper application of the law, all stakeholders must clearly understand its importance.Government officials have often failed to grasp the spirit of the explanatory notes, which outline the principles of coordination, cooperation and co-existence that underpin the IGR. Despite having the necessary legal framework, state organs have not ensured its proper execution. However, the provinces and local levels have shown resilience, refusing to relent, which is a positive aspect.Slow implementationSeveral factors have contributed to the slow implementation of the IGR law. Unstable governments have delayed meetings of Sectoral Thematic Committees, the National Coordination Council (NCC) and the Provincial Coordination Council (PCC), affecting their ability to resolve issues. Frequent changes in government have also disrupted the settings of IGR mechanisms. Additionally, the study of the law has been delayed due to a lack of resources, with employees in the law ministry often juggling dual responsibilities that hinder their work.Local governments are often unaware of many IGR law provisions and lack the resources, technical manpower and skills to implement them fully. The use of non-declarative phrases and sentences, such as “matters to be considered” or “if found necessary,” has weakened the law’s effectiveness.One striking example of such a lack of coordination is the delay of the Kathmandu-Terai fast-track project. It highlights the significant lack of coordination between the three government tiers despite the existence of the IGR law.Addressing coordination issuesA permanent structure at the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers (OPMCM) is needed to function as the secretariat of the National Coordination Council. This structure should have a strong presence of representatives from sub-federal levels. Currently, the Provincial Coordination Section of the OPMCM handles issues related to the provinces, while the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration manages local-level issues. A single mechanism should be developed to address issues concerning both federal units.Similarly, a mechanism for coordination and consultation at provincial and local levels should be established. Section 4 of the IGR law does not specify which federal body will coordinate with provinces and local levels while formulating laws and policies on exclusive and concurrent power matters. A coordination and consultation mechanism should be developed at the federal level, as the legislature has the sole authority to make laws, and the government prepares the first draft of bills.The Intergovernmental Fiscal Council was established under the Intergovernmental Fiscal Arrangement Act of 2017 to resolve fiscal issues between federal units. Since the council is more inclusive, functional and effective, the representation model used in the Sectoral Thematic Committees should be similar to that outlined in the Fiscal Council law. Having at least one local representative from each province could help raise and resolve their issues.The Provincial Coordination Council should be made more inclusive, with increased representation from local levels. This would ensure that the new mechanism represents all local levels. Compared to the initial one, the existing provision is regressive. A series of information-sharing programmes should also be conducted among federal units to educate them on the IGR law and federalism. The Federalism Implementation Special Committee of the National Assembly has urged the government to launch a broad awareness campaign from the grassroots to the federal level. Targeted training and orientation sessions at all local levels are essential to inform stakeholders about the law’s provisions and implications.Other things include resource management, skilled human resources and logistics management. These would prove beneficial in addressing the coordination issues in our federal structure.

Delays in drafting essential framework laws by federal and provincial governments have led to jurisdictional ambiguities and hindered power devolution. Financial and human resource constraints, including limited internal revenue sources and inadequate support from federal-province governments, further challenge local functions. As the dust settles on this ambitious reformation, the gap between policy intentions and ground-level execution becomes apparent. This discrepancy is particularly evident in critical sectors like health and agriculture, where policies often fail to translate into tangible improvements for the populace.Health sector struggleHealth care is a cornerstone of community welfare, and local governments often prioritise it in their annual policies and programmes. However, the ground reality starkly contrasts this vision as health centres lack basic medical equipment like sphygmomanometers and stethoscopes. The dysfunctionality of these simple tools is not just an oversight but a systemic neglect. The root of this problem is inadequate budget allocation in the health sector. The World Health Organisation (WHO) standard suggests that at least 10 percent of the government budget should be dedicated to health, yet allocations often fall below this. This shortfall is not merely a numerical issue but a failure of prioritisation. The consequence is a lack of resources for even the basic administrative needs—stationery, maintenance and utilities—that cripple health centres’ functionality. The centralisation of programme management further exacerbates these issues, as local health initiatives often depend on federal conditional programmes, limiting local governance’s scope. The constitution aims to empower local governments, but effective health sector management is challenging. The federal government’s ambitious initiative to build hospitals demonstrated poor coordination. Of the 753 local levels, 655 lacked basic hospitals. In November 2020, the KP Sharma Oli-led federal government began constructing in over 300 municipalities. Despite a two-year goal, only 27 were completed by mid-2024, as per media reports. By January 2024, 282 municipalities hadn’t submitted the detailed project report to the federal Ministry of Health and Population, and many couldn’t acquire the necessary land. Pralad Karki, chief administrative officer of Indrasarowar Rural Municipality, noted that while they planned to build a five-bed hospital with federal support, the requirement to own three ropanis of land made it impossible. Many local governments are ill-equipped to handle the financial burdens of new facilities. Considering factors such as the human development index, geographical location and the demands of external service on health institutions, inter-municipal cooperation could help establish basic hospital programmes. The decision-making process often bypassed local input, revealing a critical flaw while implementing federalism. The government mandates that 98 (local: 44, province: 32 and federal: 22) types of medicines be provided free. The federal government also allocates budgets for local governments through conditional grants to procure free medicines, but the latter has not ensured a year-round supply. Procurement often involves issues like non-compliance with laws and prioritising cost over quality. Complaints about ineffective medicines and lack of transparency are common, impacting economically disadvantaged and marginalised communities relying on these services. Improving the quality of medicine is essential for better health outcomes and preventing financial burdens on vulnerable populations.Neglected agricultureAgriculture, a sector on which a significant portion of Nepal’s population depends, suffers from a similar fate. The rhetoric around agricultural development is robust, with local governments frequently touting it as the economic backbone. However, such visions remain unrealised due to inadequate budget allocations. For the fiscal year 2024-25, the municipality allocated only 0.85 percent of its budget to agriculture.Farmers face challenges from market access to fair pricing. Middlemen dominate supply chains, often leaving farmers with meagre returns for their products. While some local governments have attempted to address these issues—Dhurkot Rural Municipality of Gulmi, for example, planned to support farmers by purchasing unsold products at fair prices—such initiatives often falter. The reasons include a lack of proper infrastructure, poor planning and a disconnect between policy and practical needs. The rural municipality’s FY 2023-024 plan included setting support prices, guaranteeing the purchase of products and providing vehicles and resources to transport goods to the market. However, farmer groups were hesitant to participate due to negative experiences with a municipality-operated cooperative that failed to compete with local shops and buy perishable goods, which led to a lack of trust and interest. The disconnect between planning and execution is evident in the failure of cold storage facilities, which were meant to help farmers store and sell their products at better times. Such failures are not isolated incidents but symptomatic of a broader issue: Inadequate feasibility studies and lack of foresight in project planning. Grant programmes managed ad hoc by elected officials, often based on political connections, have resulted in wasting state funds. Agricultural subsidies provide resources and incentives that are vital for enhancing production. However, governance challenges such as political misuse of funds, inadequate information dissemination and unfair distribution favouring those with political connections exist. Transparency issues also arise, with subsidies often going to non-existent firms and payments made without clear policies or proper assessments.Underlying issues Effective governance requires clear legislation; however, delays by federal and provincial governments in drafting essential laws have created jurisdictional ambiguities. Although local governments have the constitutional right to make laws, slow progress compels them to rely on ad hoc decisions and secondary legislation, neglecting the needs of critical areas.

In 2016, the Nepal Army lowered the water level of Imja Lake by building an exit channel for excessive water and, in 2000, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology lowered the water level in Tso Rolpa by three metres. These interventions were costly but protected thousands of people living in the settlements downward. Such efforts must also be scaled up in other high-risk lakes, and monitoring teams and early warning systems should be administered in such areas. Our authorities should immediately emulate such successful practices to reduce the severity of GLOFs. We have the opportunity to discuss the crisis in the upcoming COP29 and lobby for a significant share of Loss and Damage Funds. The minimal funds the government allocates for climate change-related issues can never cover the severity we face. Developed countries and international organisations are duty bound to help Nepal with adaptation and mitigation strategies, apart from supporting risk assessments of GLOFs. As climate change has harmed us in ways that are both profound and perilous, the general public should also realise their roles in escalating the climate crisis and vow to lessen it by switching to environment-friendly practices. We have no other option but to commit to urgent and joint actions to save the future of our planet. ","summary":"Nepal’s biggest fears are coming true: Climate change-induced disasters are here.

We have seen that movie before, and we all know that the sequel is usually worse,” Obama told delegates on Day Two of the Chicago convention.“America is ready for a new chapter. America is ready for a better story. We are ready for a President Kamala Harris.”He took aim at Trump, the Republican who followed him into the White House in 2017 and praised President Joe Biden, his vice president who was forced out of the 2024 race by Democratic allies who feared he would lose to Trump in November.“History will remember Joe Biden as a president who defended democracy at a moment of great danger. I am proud to call him my president, but even prouder to call him my friend,” Obama said, eliciting chants of “We love Joe.”Obama was introduced by his wife, Michelle, who tops Democrats’ wish list as a future president.“America, hope is making a comeback,” Michelle Obama said, in a nod to Obama’s first presidential campaign in 2008.Pulling no punches, she cautioned that Trump would try to distort Harris’ truth, much as he did “everything in his power to try to make people fear us.”“His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who also happened to be Black,” she said to deafening applause.“Who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those ‘Black jobs’?” she asked. On the campaign trail, Trump has referred to migrants crossing into the US as taking away “Black jobs.”Trump launched his political career through racist attacks on Obama’s citizenship status and has reprised similar attacks on Harris.At 63, Barack Obama loomed large in the messy deliberations that led Biden to step out of the race last month and endorse Harris, his vice president.Harris momentumHarris, 59, has ridden a historic whirlwind in which her campaign has broken records for fundraising and packed arenas with supporters.Harris joined virtually from a campaign rally in Milwaukee. Delegates in Chicago raised signs saying “FREEDOM” that mirrored those raised by supporters at her Wisconsin rally.Harris and her vice presidential pick, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, took to the Milwaukee stage in the same venue as last month’s Republican National Convention, where Trump formally received his party’s nod.In her speech, Harris criticized Trump for saying he had no regrets about the US Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling that overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that had recognized women’s constitutional right to abortion. Three Trump-appointed justices joined a 6-3 majority on the high court.“I do believe, you know, bad behavior should result in a consequence. Well we will make sure he does face a consequence and that will be at the ballot box in November,” Harris said.Democrats see abortion rights as a winning issue in this campaign and Harris had led the charge as vice president.Crossing the aisleRepublicans who have left the fold since Trump’s takeover of their party crossed the aisle on Tuesday night to address the convention, including Trump’s former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham and former Trump voter Kyle Sweetser.Grisham described her journey from a Trump “true believer” to the first senior White House staffer to resign after the Jan. 6, 2021, assault by Trump supporters on the US Capitol.Republican Mayor John Giles of Mesa, Arizona, remembered the late John McCain, the Republican US senator from his state who made a point of reaching across the aisle.“I have an urgent message for the majority of Americans who, like me, are in the political middle,” he said. “John McCain’s Republican Party is gone, and we don’t owe a damn thing to what’s been left behind.”Conservative voters who dislike Trump have been one of the Democrats’ hoped-for prizes.

We have seen that movie before, and we all know that the sequel is usually worse,” Obama told delegates on Day Two of the Chicago convention.“America is ready for a new chapter. America is ready for a better story. We are ready for a President Kamala Harris.”He took aim at Trump, the Republican who followed him into the White House in 2017 and praised President Joe Biden, his vice president who was forced out of the 2024 race by Democratic allies who feared he would lose to Trump in November.“History will remember Joe Biden as a president who defended democracy at a moment of great danger. I am proud to call him my president, but even prouder to call him my friend,” Obama said, eliciting chants of “We love Joe.”Obama was introduced by his wife, Michelle, who tops Democrats’ wish list as a future president.“America, hope is making a comeback,” Michelle Obama said, in a nod to Obama’s first presidential campaign in 2008.Pulling no punches, she cautioned that Trump would try to distort Harris’ truth, much as he did “everything in his power to try to make people fear us.”“His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who also happened to be Black,” she said to deafening applause.“Who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those ‘Black jobs’?” she asked. On the campaign trail, Trump has referred to migrants crossing into the US as taking away “Black jobs.”Trump launched his political career through racist attacks on Obama’s citizenship status and has reprised similar attacks on Harris.At 63, Barack Obama loomed large in the messy deliberations that led Biden to step out of the race last month and endorse Harris, his vice president.Harris momentumHarris, 59, has ridden a historic whirlwind in which her campaign has broken records for fundraising and packed arenas with supporters.Harris joined virtually from a campaign rally in Milwaukee. Delegates in Chicago raised signs saying “FREEDOM” that mirrored those raised by supporters at her Wisconsin rally.Harris and her vice presidential pick, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, took to the Milwaukee stage in the same venue as last month’s Republican National Convention, where Trump formally received his party’s nod.In her speech, Harris criticized Trump for saying he had no regrets about the US Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling that overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that had recognized women’s constitutional right to abortion. Three Trump-appointed justices joined a 6-3 majority on the high court.“I do believe, you know, bad behavior should result in a consequence. Well we will make sure he does face a consequence and that will be at the ballot box in November,” Harris said.Democrats see abortion rights as a winning issue in this campaign and Harris had led the charge as vice president.Crossing the aisleRepublicans who have left the fold since Trump’s takeover of their party crossed the aisle on Tuesday night to address the convention, including Trump’s former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham and former Trump voter Kyle Sweetser.Grisham described her journey from a Trump “true believer” to the first senior White House staffer to resign after the Jan. 6, 2021, assault by Trump supporters on the US Capitol.Republican Mayor John Giles of Mesa, Arizona, remembered the late John McCain, the Republican US senator from his state who made a point of reaching across the aisle.“I have an urgent message for the majority of Americans who, like me, are in the political middle,” he said. “John McCain’s Republican Party is gone, and we don’t owe a damn thing to what’s been left behind.”Conservative voters who dislike Trump have been one of the Democrats’ hoped-for prizes. The challenge will be persuading them to get to the ballot box and vote for Harris versus staying home or writing in a presidential candidate.Outside the venue, a demonstration near Chicago’s Israeli consulate briefly turned violent after a group of about 50 separated from the larger protest and pushed against a police line.

But our investment and preparation for the Olympics and other international events are woefully inadequate,” said former Olympican Deepak Bista, who currently serves as the president of Nepal Olympians Association and the director of national team preparation, at the National Sports Council. “There are no proper venues for players to train and practice, So how do you compete against elite athletes from around the world?” Athlete Santoshi Shrestha completed the difficult 41.195km track of the women’s marathon event in the 79th position out of 91 athletes. Her timing of 2 hours 55 minutes and 06 seconds was far from her previous best and national record of 2 hours 46 minutes and 23 seconds, which she set on the way to marathon debut gold at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Dhaka Marathon earlier this year.After the women’s marathon, Santoshi said she could have set a new national record in Paris had she pushed herself more in an endurance-testing track, but she chose not to because of fear of possible injury.“I could not take the risk because the track was very steep after 15 km. I was comfortable and could have made a new record there [in Paris] but I chose to stay in the comfort zone. I want to compete in other tournaments as well,” said Santoshi.But Santoshi’s story could have been different had her preparations and training back home been better. “Further, players, coaches and team management all need to work hard with complete focus and dedication all round the year if they are to bring medals. Sadly, the state of our players is not good enough. They are compelled to find other jobs so that they can look after their families. How can we expect them to win medals at big tournaments?” added Bista, who was the second Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, Beijing 2008.“The players need physical, mental and financial support.”Former Nepali Olympian Sangina Baidya also points to poor investment and preparation in sports for Nepal’s underperformance at the Olympics.“There is a lack of extensive investment in sports infrastructures. The state should be interested in the development of sports. If there is sufficient investment at the youth level, and they get substantial funding, resources and infractures, they can undoubtedly perform better in the international competitions including the Olympics,” said taekwondo practitioner Baidya, who was the first Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, in Athens 2004, through a selection tournament.“In comparison to other successful countries, here in Nepal, preparations for the Olympics start late. They get only a few months of training, which is not enough,” she added.Judoka Manita Shrestha Pradhan has a similar story. She got a training room only two months before the Olympics and she was still expected to win at least one or two bouts in Paris—which is a lot to ask for. Shrestha Pradhan could not progress beyond the first round of women’s 57 kg weight category event.There is no targeted budget for the Olympics programme despite the sports sector getting Rs3.5 billion for the fiscal year 2024/25. Only Rs9 million was allocated for the transport, lodging and food of athletes and officials participating in the Paris Olympics and Paralympics.The Nepal Olympic Committee provides $750 per person to the 10 athletes of the 10 sports under the International Olympic Committee’s Solidarity scholarship, which is insufficient. Swimmers Alexander Shah and Duana Lama trained abroad, in the United States and Thailand, respectively, but the scholarship amount was not enough for them to train at top-class facilities. Lama finished last in her Heat and 30th overall in women’s 200m freestyle.Shah, who was competing at the Olympics for a second consecutive time, will at least return home with some joy. His 51.91 seconds in the men’s 100m freestyle Heat shattered his own previous national record of 52.17 seconds set during the World Aquatic Championship in Doha, Qatar.Badminton star Prince Dahal trained in Sri Lanka and had to travel to Paris 2024 without a coach as Nepali authorities did not send the name of the coach for accreditation and visa process on time.Prince Dahal could not win a single match in the men’s singles group stage. Shooter Sushmita Nepal finished 42nd in the women’s 10m air rifle qualification event. Table tennis player Santoo Shrestha also exited the Olympics from the men’s singles preliminary round.But big investment in sports may not always do the trick.Santoo Shrestha, who competed in the men’s singles table tennis at Paris Olympics, was the only third player in Nepal’s Olympic history to qualify for the Olympics through the selection stage—which is a perfect demonstration of how poor the country is technically.Take Jamaica and Kenya. Athletes in these countries are highly successful in athletics.Jamaica—the home of sprinter Usian Bolt, eight time Olympic gold medallist and world record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 4 × 100 metres relay—has won a total of 87 medals at the Olympics. Of them 86 have come from track and field.Kenya is the most successful African country at the Olympics, with a total of 124 medals so far. Of them 117 are from track and field and seven from boxing.Ethiopia is another nation which focuses on long-distance events. Their total of 58 Olympic medals have all come in long-distance events in athletics.India was once a dominant country in field hockey and won a record 11 Olympic medals, including eight golds between 1928 and 1980. Although the country experienced a drought in hockey medals, the sport is gradually finding new success after its team picked two consecutive hockey bronze medals in Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024. Wrestling and shooting are the other sports Indian athletes specialise in.“The government should learn from how other countries prepare their athletes,” said Bista, suggesting that Nepal should target some sports for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and prepare accordingly.Nepal has won a total of 26 medals at the Asian Games. Of them, it has bagged 24 medals in martial arts, which include karate (4), taekwondo (14) and boxing (6). “Nepal should select sports in which Nepal is historically good, for instance martial arts. After that, the government should allocate a significant budget just for the Olympics programme and train the players from the beginning if it expects our athletes to do better,” Bista added.Technically, Nepal’s only medal at the Olympics came in 1988 in Seoul when Bidhan Lama won a bronze medal in the men’s 50kg weight category taekwondo competition. But his medal was counted as unofficial as the sport was then an exhibition event. Taekwondo entered the Olympics programme only at Sydney 2000.But the 2026 Asian Games in Aichi-Nagoya, Japan could be a head start.The National Sports Council has launched Mission 2026 as part of the preparations for the next Asiad and has targeted at least 10 medals. But, sadly, the government has only approved Rs20 million for the programme.“We don’t have enough funding for the programme. This amount will support our athletes for only five to six months. It is unfortunate that the government could not embrace the NSC’s mission.” Bista said, adding that he fears Mission 2026 will just be an ambitious dream.But Bista hopes Palesha Goverdhan may change history despite the odds. Goverdhan became the first Nepali paralympian to pass the selection stage when she qualified for the Paris Paralympics. She won a gold medal in the Asian Qualifiers in China.Govardhan also won a bronze at the 2022 Asian Para Games, becoming the first Nepali para athlete to win a medal at the event.“Palesha is training in London under one of the best trainers,” said Bista who added that the NSC is paying her training fees.

This shift comes after the party lost an election due to a lack of local organization.\n\nDespite its claim to be different from other parties, RSP is now following the same strategy by expanding its committees to the grassroots level.\n\nObservers believe that political parties need members to function effectively and that RSP's new approach may lead to problems in finding dedicated cadres. However, RSP officials insist that their structure will be different and focus on small, disciplined committees.","summary":"The Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) claims to be a ‘cadre-less party’ on its official website, under the section ‘How Are We Different?’. The RSP emerged as the fourth-largest party in the House of Representatives from the November 2022 general elections, within six months of its registration with the Election Commission.At the time, the party was truly an organisation without a cadre base and it emerged as a prominent political force by selling its anti-corruption agenda.The three largest parties—the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre)—fight elections mainly based on their cadre strength across the country. Nepal’s communist parties are heavily dependent on their networks of cadres. Though the Congress used to claim to be a mass-based organisation, it has also become a cadre-based party with structures down to the 753 local units and deeper into wards and toles.The RSP mentions on its website eight points to show how it is different from other parties. One of the points presents itself as a party without cadres.Within two years of its formation, however, it is now considering building party committees down to the grassroots. The party plans to expand its organisation not only to local units but also their wards—just like the traditional parties.Soon after being ousted from government last month, the RSP organised a closed camp in Kathmandu on August 2-3, which decided to form party committees at the local level and also to form shadow local governments. It was the April Ilam by-election that changed RSP leaders’ perception and made them realise the importance of party committees at the local level. Despite its high expectations and mobilisation of the party’s full strength at the Ilam constituency, the party lost the election. RSP leaders later concluded that the weak party organisation was to blame.“A new party like ours has a weak organisation compared to more established parties. Due to this, the RSP could not do well in the Ilam-2 byelection,” Manish Jha, who then was the joint spokesperson for the party, had told the Post from Ilam.The party’s closed camp last week provided 15 points of suggestion to the leadership. One concerned forming shadow governments at local units along with the expansion of party committees.The 14th point is about “practising formation of shadow governments at local units in a phase-wise approach”. “The closed camp advised the central committee to form shadow governments at the local level but that is not an official party decision,” acting general secretary Kabindra Burlakoti told the Post. “But the central committee will probably support this proposal.” Despite the party officially announcing that it would be a cadre-free organisation, Burlakoti claims that the party has been constituting local committees since its formation. Currently, it has formed committees in 1,800 out of 6743 wards and sees the possibility of expanding them to at least 4,000 wards. Burlakoti says despite going down to the local level, the party won’t form large committees. But political observers are not convinced.“Without cadres, no political party can form its committees,” Pitamber Bhandari, a political observer, told the Post. “Formation of local chapters is a shift in the RSP’s stance.” The RSP, which claims to be an alternative political force, is considering following the footsteps of old parties by expanding party committees to the grassroots.Suryaraj Acharya, a former leader of Bibeksheel Sajha party that championed the idea of alternative politics in the country, said the RSP seems confused about the party structure. Acharya, who also contested the second Constituent Assembly election from Kathmandu-2, said the Bibeksheel Sajha also faced a similar confusion then. “Not only in Nepal, alternative political parties in other parts of the world also seem confused about their structures,” Acharya told the Post. “How can they lead alternative politics through a party similarly structured to old forces they so strongly criticised?”Burlakoti does not agree.“The structure itself is irrelevant when we make the committees small and disciplined,” he argues. Bhandari doesn’t buy Burlakoti’s argument.“When their party was in power, they recommended the party central committee member Arnico Kumar Panday as a member of the National Planning Commission. He relinquished party membership but when the party left the government, Panday resigned from the commission and rejoined the party,” Bhandari said. “How is their approach different then?” Bhandari questioned. Acharya doubts the RSP can reshape itself easily. They might also face difficulties in finding cadres at the grassroots level where the old parties have form bases. “Even if they find some people who can push their agenda through social media, it is difficult to find whole timers to run party committees.”Acting general secretary Burlakoti, however, said the RSP’s structure will be different to that of other parties. “Even as the committees of other parties are more inclined to misuse the budget at the local level, our party won’t indulge in such things.” Acharya recalls Bibeksheel Sajha’s mistake. “While we tried to give shape to the party structure, activists and some people without political culture joined us. This ultimately caused a lot of problems,” he said. “The RSP might face a similar problem if they are not careful.” "},{"hash":"054452e966e89eaaf8ad200f91ff212b6e2963d924fd40793dfe6fba5de5c278","title":"**India's Foreign Policy Misalignment**\n\nIndia faces challenges in aligning its foreign policy due to:\n\n* **Domestic factors:** Internal divisions and differing perspectives among political parties and the public.\n* **Global shifts:** Changing power dynamics and the rise of new actors in the international arena.\n* **Economic pressures:** Balancing economic interests with geopolitical priorities.\n* **Regional dynamics:** Complex relationships with neighbors and competing regional powers.\n* **Ideological divides:** Divergent views on issues such as democracy, human rights, and sovereignty.\n\nThis misalignment hinders India's ability to:\n\n* Maintain strategic partnerships and secure its interests.\n* Respond effectively to global crises and challenges.\n* Project its influence and contribute to shaping the international order.","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/08/10/india-s-foreign-policy-misalignment","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/leadpostillustrationajayakhanal-1723299610.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1723248000000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"**Bangladesh and India**\n\nRecent events in Bangladesh have shaken people.

At the meeting, Sharma asked Dahal to step down as party chairman. Dahal has led the party uninterruptedly for over three-and-a-half decades.At the end of the standing committee meeting, leaders had said that the differences between Dahal and Sharma were resolved. But that conclusion seems premature. The two were busy accusing and criticising each other at a public function in Kathmandu. Dahal had to pacify Sharma on Saturday as he complained of not being trusted by Dahal and other Maoist leaders. “When I was assigned to build an alliance with the CPN-UML, I worked for the same but was tagged as KP Oli’s man,” Sharma said at the function. Later, the Maoist Centre decided to ally with the Nepali Congress, and he worked for the same as directed by Dahal, Sharma claimed. “But I was dubbed Sher Bahadur Deuba’s man. When will I be called the Maoist party’s man? When will you call me Prachanda’s man?” said Sharma, pointing to Dahal, who was sitting at the same podium as the chief guest.Taken aback, Dahal seemed to be consoling Sharma saying that comrade Prabhakar [Sharma] would never split the party, contrary to some media reports.Dahal rubbished reports that Sharma was trying to split the party as baseless and that the days-long standing committee meeting had dispelled all rumours.The Maoist party chief and former prime minister, however, admitted that there were still some confusions and that the meeting had decided to look into the matter and make things clear and resolve them with joint effort.Soon after the party was out of the government, it called the meetings of the standing committee and the secretariat and discussed the Maoist CEntre's future course, including unity with other fringe parties, strengthening the Socialist Front, and building the party’s organisation.“There were some matters of serious suspicion and some still exist. And the meeting has decided to study and find how such a situation of suspicion emerged,” Dahal said. The Maoist leader promised to study the issue jointly with Sharma and, if needed, the party may form a probe committee.“We have reached an understanding to properly address the remaining concerns as well,” Dahal added.Sharma is not alone in demanding that Dahal handover the party’s reins.Even Maoist Centre senior vice-chair Narayan Kaji Shrestha has asked Dahal to quit the leadership position. A large number of Maoist leaders at the central as well as lower committees want to see an overhaul of the party, said a central member.“If we fail to transform the party, there will be no hope for us besides surrendering to other parties in the 2027 elections,” the leader said.Another central committee member however doesn’t trust Dahal to build the party organisation. “Dahal would rather forge unity with other left parties and, if possible, explore options to contest the upcoming elections jointly with CPN-UML, the country’s largest communist party,” said the central member.The leader said he was unsure if the ruling UML would turn down Dahal’s proposal to join hands once again. According to him, Dahal’s strategy is to bring together left-leaning parties and put pressure on the UML, which leads the government with the backing of the Nepali Congress, to make an electoral alliance with the Maoists. The leader argues that the UML is preparing itself internally to contest the elections on its own, without allying with anyone.“This is the beginning of an infighting in the Maoist Centre because we abandoned the agenda of strengthening the federal, republican and secular Nepal,” said Ram Karki, secretary of the Maoist Centre. “This tussle is unlikely to stop anytime soon.”Because the conflict emerged under Dahal’s ‘schooling’, Karki claimed.He recalled that Mohan Baidya, who supported Dahal’s school of thought, engaged in a similar tussle before leaving the party. That conflict did not subside but intensified, leading Baidya to finally split the party, Karki observed.Later, Baburam Bhattarai, who also emerged allegedly from Dahal’s schooling, led a similar revolt, Karki recalled. “He also deserted the party. This time, too, the tussle has surfaced among those schooled under Dahal, so no one knows the outcome,” said Karki.For decades, Sharma remained a close confidant of Dahal. But he grew up to be a dissident after Dahal refused to appoint him the general secretary last year. Another deputy general secretary, Barsha Man Pun, was also an aspirant for the post of general secretary.Sharma and Pun are taken as Dahal’s lieutenants, right from the launch of the Maoist insurgency in 1996. Sidelining both during the 2022 party general convention, Dahal picked Dev Gurung, who had little influence in the party.Karki described the Congress-UML alliance’s move to oust the Maoist Centre from the government as a good opportunity to strengthen the Maoist party.“If the Nepali Congress and the UML hadn’t ejected our party from the government, we would have been finished by the time of next elections,” said Karki. “As we have been removed from power three years ahead of the election, there is some room for transformation.”Senior party leaders have given Dahal two options: transform himself and the party or vacate the chair that he has been occupying for over 35 years.Another central committee member said that if the conflict was an internal matter and the fight genuine, the party would emerge unscathed. “Otherwise, if external factors are working within the party, then the party will face a serious crisis,” said the leader.However, some Maoist leaders are confident that the party will not face a grave crisis. “Janardan ji questioned the party leadership. Isn’t that a good practice in the party?” said Yubaraj Chaulagain, a central committee member. “However, Chairman Dahal is addressing them.”Chaulagain said that the party leadership would collect reports from the party’s provincial committees and sister organisations and take the right decision based on them. “There’s the proposal for the party’s transformation.

The two leaders raised the issue during the standing committee meeting that commenced on August 9.Leaders concluded the meeting on Thursday as they decided to strengthen the Maoist party through internal dialogue between the leaders on their disagreements.Party secretary Ram Karki said that responding to the questions raised during the standing committee meeting on August 10, party chair Dahal vowed to address their issues.The party will resolve the theoretical as well as ideological differences among the party leaders through dialogue, Karki told the Post, quoting Dahal.On August 9, the first day of the meeting, the Maoist chair presented a verbal proposal on current political affairs, party building, and other pertinent issues.After Dahal’s presentation, some leaders raised questions about the party’s policies and leadership. Among them, Janardan Sharma, a deputy general secretary, submitted a written proposal on August 10, calling for a review of Dahal’s leadership and suggesting that the party chair be limited to a ceremonial role as patron.In his document, Sharma alleged, among other things, that the party leadership was trying to use state power against him.In the 14-page document submitted to the meeting, Sharma accused the party leadership of ‘spreading disinformation’ about him and the other deputy general secretary, Pun. He also accused the top leaders of even misusing state power against him.“The fake information about the party split, which was generated from Khumaltar [the private residence of Dahal], spread widely after reaching Baluwatar [the prime minister’s official residence where Dahal was staying until last month when the government changed],” Sharma questions the party leadership in his document. “There are questions: why did the leadership disseminate fake information?”However, Maoist Centre leaders said the issue has been settled, for now, after Dahal pledged to resolve it through intra-party discussions.Party chair Dahal, while speaking to the press briefly after the conclusion of the standing committee meeting on Thursday, said the reports and rumours about party split were baseless.“Rumours related to the party split led by comrade Prabhakar [Janardan Sharma] are baseless,” Dahal told journalists.The meeting also decided to hold consultative meetings at the provincial level, where the party's office bearers will also participate. After the meeting, the party will call for a full-fledged meeting of the central committee in mid-September (Ashoj first week).Another party secretary, Devendra Paudel, said the upcoming central committee meeting will call the party's special general convention, as decided during the eigth general convention held in 2022.But Lilamani Pokharel, a party secretary, says no decision was taken with regard to convening a special general convention as only the central committee has a mandate to call a special general convention, the supreme body of a party that can take final decisions on the party’s policies and leadership.“The party will go for a special general convention only if a central committee meeting decides to go for that,” Pokharel told the Post.After the party was out of the government in mid-July, calls for Dahal to relinquish the top position have grown. Haribol Gajurel, a close aide of Dahal and deputy general secretary, also raised the issue of leadership change during a meeting of party officials before the standing committee meeting and demanded a special congress to address the issues.Gajurel proposed that all office-bearers should resign and make a fresh start to rejuvenate the party. He even submitted his own resignation as a starting point. Following this, on the second day of the standing committee meeting held on August 10, Deputy General Secretary Sharma questioned the central leadership in his political paper.However, party spokesperson Agni Sapkota, who is close to Dahal, argued that the questions raised by Sharma were aimed at strengthening the party. “The issue I raised during the standing committee meeting was for the betterment of the party and to strengthen the leadership of Dahal,” Sapkota quoted Sharma as saying.“The party leadership has also taken the issue raised by the standing committee members, including deputy general secretary Gajurel, Sharma, and Barshaman Pun, on a positive note.”During Dahal's tenure as prime minister, Gajurel, his political adviser, had previously expressed dissatisfaction with the party's lack of adherence to procedures and methods. As questions arose about the central leadership of the Maoist Centre, which is focused on organisational development, Dahal found himself in a defensive position during the standing committee meeting. According to party insiders, it was after a long time that Dahal faced tremendous pressure during a standing committee meeting as both Sharma and Pun, who have strong command in the party organisation, stood together to demand Dahal’s exit from the party leadership. It was something unusual for Maoist leaders as the two leaders, who defended Dahal in the past, joined hands by closing their ranks to fiercely criticise the party chief. Sharma and Pun, both former finance ministers, are deemed the two most powerful leaders after Dahal.Both leaders claimed the position of general secretary at the party’s general convention in early 2022. Though they were willing to contest for the post, Dahal instead chose Dev Gurung as the general secretary. After the general convention, Sharma has been maintaining a distance from Dahal and he challenges the party chief on various occasions. Of late, Pun, too, has joined Sharma to challenge Dahal. At the standing committee meeting, Pun said there should be a debate on the party's chairperson's term limit. \"Instead of discussing whether the leader should step down now, we need to determine the chair’s term limit,\" he added. Leaders said Dahal faced a pressure of this scale in a party meeting probably for the first time in nearly a decade, since the exit of key leaders Baburam Bhattarai and Mohan Baidya. Bhattarai and Baidya lead their own parties now. ","summary":"CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has been leading the party for over three-and-a-half decades, has yet again pacified the leaders who want him to hand over the leadership.Janardan Sharma and Barsha Man Pun—deputy general secretaries of the Maoist party—had demanded that Dahal hand over the party leadership to a leader of their generation. The two leaders raised the issue during the standing committee meeting that commenced on August 9.Leaders concluded the meeting on Thursday as they decided to strengthen the Maoist party through internal dialogue between the leaders on their disagreements.Party secretary Ram Karki said that responding to the questions raised during the standing committee meeting on August 10, party chair Dahal vowed to address their issues.The party will resolve the theoretical as well as ideological differences among the party leaders through dialogue, Karki told the Post, quoting Dahal.On August 9, the first day of the meeting, the Maoist chair presented a verbal proposal on current political affairs, party building, and other pertinent issues.After Dahal’s presentation, some leaders raised questions about the party’s policies and leadership. Among them, Janardan Sharma, a deputy general secretary, submitted a written proposal on August 10, calling for a review of Dahal’s leadership and suggesting that the party chair be limited to a ceremonial role as patron.In his document, Sharma alleged, among other things, that the party leadership was trying to use state power against him.In the 14-page document submitted to the meeting, Sharma accused the party leadership of ‘spreading disinformation’ about him and the other deputy general secretary, Pun. He also accused the top leaders of even misusing state power against him.“The fake information about the party split, which was generated from Khumaltar [the private residence of Dahal], spread widely after reaching Baluwatar [the prime minister’s official residence where Dahal was staying until last month when the government changed],” Sharma questions the party leadership in his document. “There are questions: why did the leadership disseminate fake information?”However, Maoist Centre leaders said the issue has been settled, for now, after Dahal pledged to resolve it through intra-party discussions.Party chair Dahal, while speaking to the press briefly after the conclusion of the standing committee meeting on Thursday, said the reports and rumours about party split were baseless.“Rumours related to the party split led by comrade Prabhakar [Janardan Sharma] are baseless,” Dahal told journalists.The meeting also decided to hold consultative meetings at the provincial level, where the party's office bearers will also participate. After the meeting, the party will call for a full-fledged meeting of the central committee in mid-September (Ashoj first week).Another party secretary, Devendra Paudel, said the upcoming central committee meeting will call the party's special general convention, as decided during the eigth general convention held in 2022.But Lilamani Pokharel, a party secretary, says no decision was taken with regard to convening a special general convention as only the central committee has a mandate to call a special general convention, the supreme body of a party that can take final decisions on the party’s policies and leadership.“The party will go for a special general convention only if a central committee meeting decides to go for that,” Pokharel told the Post.After the party was out of the government in mid-July, calls for Dahal to relinquish the top position have grown. Haribol Gajurel, a close aide of Dahal and deputy general secretary, also raised the issue of leadership change during a meeting of party officials before the standing committee meeting and demanded a special congress to address the issues.Gajurel proposed that all office-bearers should resign and make a fresh start to rejuvenate the party.

After long deliberations, the Assembly had sent the bill to the House after endorsing it in April last year. However, the lower house is still debating it. The statute of limitation is a bone of contention.A provision in the bill says, “The corruption case must be prosecuted within five years from the date of knowing that such an act has been committed.\" But there is no time limit in lodging the case where the state suffers direct losses.Even if someone is retired from any profession, s/he can be prosecuted within five years of retirement, says another provision in the amendment bill.After the discussion on the limit in the parliamentary committee, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority has proposed to widen the window to 10 years.However, the parties have yet to agree on the matter. While some Nepali Congress and Rastriya Swatantra Party lawmakers want removal of the provision, other parties have not made their official positions clear yet.Oli, who appeared before the House committee on July 22, made no comment on it.

Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” ","summary":"The rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers.

This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” "},{"hash":"104b9b3a1799aebb554c297c6e332bd36867ec7edde26236fc688a8e415ee180","title":"lions-club-of-kathmandu-corporate-felicitates-various-personalities","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/valley/2024/08/04/lions-club-of-kathmandu-corporate-felicitates-various-personalities","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/photoforlionstory-1722787264.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1722729600000,"source":"kp","category":"valley","content":"The Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation.

While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesn’t just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. “They need options that won’t affect their income; a crackdown won’t work.”Dawadi emphasises that KMC shouldn’t view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure ‘disabled-friendly.’ Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. “People with disabilities should be involved in planning,” she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.“On many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,” he explains. “The footpath has become just a showpiece.”Rishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmandu’s footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministry’s Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMC’s recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishi’s organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.“The constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,” Adhikari said. “Forget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.”Rishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, “forcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.” This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.“Despite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,” Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. “This reflects a major failure of the state’s duty,” he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the country’s road infrastructure. “We don’t know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,” she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. “Without clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, it’s hard for us to find our destinations,” Ray says. “As I can’t hear, I rely on signs for guidance.”Ray also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. “Crossing the road can be chaotic,” he notes. “With drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.”Ray was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didn’t suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMC’s new footpaths and railings are a step forward but “they are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.”According to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term ‘disabled-friendly’ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an ‘inclusivity checklist’ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. “What about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?” he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. “There’s no guidance or facilities for us,” she said.Shrestha criticises the KMC’s approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. “Construction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,” he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. “While we’re committed to making footpaths accessible, we’re not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,” he said.“We’ve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we can’t address every issue alone.”Baburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. “We are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,” he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.“We’ve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmandu’s pavements and roads, but that doesn’t mean they’re not problematic,” Kumal says. “Accessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.” ","summary":"In Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions.

Nepal now exports almost equal to what the country used to generate five years ago. Observers see the development as a sign of strengthened ties between the neighbouring countries. Last fiscal year, which ended in mid-July, Nepal became a net exporter of electricity. That means Nepal is selling more electricity than it buys. The country’s power utility, Nepal Electricity Authority, said it exported 1.94 billion units of electricity, or more than 700 MW, worth Rs17.07 billion in the last fiscal year. During the dry season, Nepal imported 1.91 billion units of electricity worth Rs16.93 billion. “We have estimated that the export revenue would increase to Rs27 billion in the current fiscal year if we succeeded in exporting the additional power or up to 1,000 MW,” said Chandan Kumar Ghosh, the authority spokesperson. “Our preference, however, is domestic consumption. We will export the surplus,” he said. “After we receive a no-objection letter from India, the export will begin or be formalised.”Currently, Nepal is exporting 620 MW of energy from the 400 kV Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur cross-border transmission line, and 70 MW is being exported via the 132 kV Mahendranagar-Tanakpur transmission line. Nepal Electricity Authority has also entered medium-term power sales agreements with state electricity boards (power distribution companies known in short as discoms) in Haryana and Bihar. And for the first time, Nepal is exporting power to Bihar through a medium-term power sales agreement.“We are happy that Nepal exports about 1,000 MW of electricity to India. This is a new milestone.Our neighbourhood first policy and specific people-to-people and cultural ties have advanced our relationship,” the Indian Embassy in Nepal wrote on X.This is the first year of a long-term energy deal in which India has signed an agreement to buy 10,000 MW of electricity from Nepal in the next ten years.According to a statement by the Indian embassy in Nepal, the Designated Authority of India has approved importing additional energy from 12 hydropower projects in Nepal. This takes the total allowed quantum from 690 MW from 16 projects to 941 MW from 28 projects.In October 2021, India approved 39 MW of power imports from Nepal for the first time. This figure has grown more than 24-fold in less than three years.Nepal first began exporting power by selling in the day-ahead market of the Indian Energy Exchange. Since then, Nepal has also been granted access to the real-time market. Nepal has been selling 44 MW in the real-time market since the southern neighbour opened the door to competition in July last year.India has also opened the provision of counting hydropower imports from Nepal as a part of the Hydropower Purchase Obligation for buyers in India, which further incentivizes buyers to purchase power from Nepal.“With these developments, Nepal is on track to become the leading hydropower exporter in the South Asia region,” reads the statement. “An agreement to sell 40 MW power to Bangladesh has also been finalised. It was planned to be signed on July 28, 2024, but was postponed due to recent political developments in Bangladesh.”Despite political instability, Nepal is slowly but steadily moving towards realising its hydropower potential. Between 2007 and 2017, the country experienced a massive electricity supply shortage that caused up to 18 hours of daily load-shedding. That caused a severe dent in Nepal’s economy, stalling the growth of manufacturing, which ultimately forced thousands of youths to try their luck abroad due to the lack of job opportunities at home. Installed power generation capacity crawled from 706 MW in 2011 to 856 MW in 2016.Nepal signed the India-Nepal Power Trade Agreement in 2014 during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit, even though it was reeling from an acute power shortage.Nepal became a power surplus country during the wet season after the 456 MW Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Project came into operation in July 2021.According to the power utility, the installed electricity capacity has now increased to 3,156.96 MW, consisting of 2,990.6 MW of hydroelectric power, 106.9 MW of solar power, 6 MW of cogeneration, and 53.4 MW of thermal electricity.“We have estimated to add more than 1,000 MW of electricity this fiscal year to take the energy quantum to 4,500 MW,” said Ghosh, the spokesperson.Various reports show that electricity trade could significantly narrow Nepal’s trade deficit if there is a political will to attract foreign direct investment in the hydro sector. According to a report, Nepal can earn up to Rs310 billion annually in 2030 and as high as Rs1,069 billion annually in 2045 if it sells electricity to India by harnessing its hydropower potential.Nepal stands to generate these earnings provided it starts exporting 13 gigawatts of electricity to India by 2030 and doubles this capacity by 2045, according to a 2017 USAID report titled ‘Economic Benefits from Nepal-India Electricity Trade’.According to the report produced by Integrated Research and Action for Development, Nepal needs to invest up to Rs2,596 billion by 2030 and another Rs2,216 billion between 2031 and 2045 to harness the electricity of this quantum.In a statement issued recently by Kul Man Ghising, the managing director of Nepal Electricity Authority, Nepal plans to generate 28,000 MW of electricity by 2035. It said that in the next five years, or by 2028-29, Nepal's installed capacity would reach 10,000 MW. Projects totalling nearly 7,000 MW are currently in various stages of construction.”The electricity authority said it is also ready to sign a power purchase agreement (PPA) with solar projects up to 800MW.  ","summary":"India approved a plan to import an additional 251 MW of electricity from Nepal on Monday, bringing the total imports to nearly 1,000 MW.

Since then, Nepal has also been granted access to the real-time market. Nepal has been selling 44 MW in the real-time market since the southern neighbour opened the door to competition in July last year.India has also opened the provision of counting hydropower imports from Nepal as a part of the Hydropower Purchase Obligation for buyers in India, which further incentivizes buyers to purchase power from Nepal.“With these developments, Nepal is on track to become the leading hydropower exporter in the South Asia region,” reads the statement. “An agreement to sell 40 MW power to Bangladesh has also been finalised. It was planned to be signed on July 28, 2024, but was postponed due to recent political developments in Bangladesh.”Despite political instability, Nepal is slowly but steadily moving towards realising its hydropower potential. Between 2007 and 2017, the country experienced a massive electricity supply shortage that caused up to 18 hours of daily load-shedding. That caused a severe dent in Nepal’s economy, stalling the growth of manufacturing, which ultimately forced thousands of youths to try their luck abroad due to the lack of job opportunities at home. Installed power generation capacity crawled from 706 MW in 2011 to 856 MW in 2016.Nepal signed the India-Nepal Power Trade Agreement in 2014 during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit, even though it was reeling from an acute power shortage.Nepal became a power surplus country during the wet season after the 456 MW Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Project came into operation in July 2021.According to the power utility, the installed electricity capacity has now increased to 3,156.96 MW, consisting of 2,990.6 MW of hydroelectric power, 106.9 MW of solar power, 6 MW of cogeneration, and 53.4 MW of thermal electricity.“We have estimated to add more than 1,000 MW of electricity this fiscal year to take the energy quantum to 4,500 MW,” said Ghosh, the spokesperson.Various reports show that electricity trade could significantly narrow Nepal’s trade deficit if there is a political will to attract foreign direct investment in the hydro sector. According to a report, Nepal can earn up to Rs310 billion annually in 2030 and as high as Rs1,069 billion annually in 2045 if it sells electricity to India by harnessing its hydropower potential.Nepal stands to generate these earnings provided it starts exporting 13 gigawatts of electricity to India by 2030 and doubles this capacity by 2045, according to a 2017 USAID report titled ‘Economic Benefits from Nepal-India Electricity Trade’.According to the report produced by Integrated Research and Action for Development, Nepal needs to invest up to Rs2,596 billion by 2030 and another Rs2,216 billion between 2031 and 2045 to harness the electricity of this quantum.In a statement issued recently by Kul Man Ghising, the managing director of Nepal Electricity Authority, Nepal plans to generate 28,000 MW of electricity by 2035. It said that in the next five years, or by 2028-29, Nepal's installed capacity would reach 10,000 MW. Projects totalling nearly 7,000 MW are currently in various stages of construction.”The electricity authority said it is also ready to sign a power purchase agreement (PPA) with solar projects up to 800MW.  "},{"hash":"885370a33240edce455494da57106cde5af475c1c2b23e3879c1f667de88e7cd","title":"remittance-tourism-drive-economy-other-sectors-lag","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/08/19/remittance-tourism-drive-economy-other-sectors-lag","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/money/touristcopy-1724029512.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1724025600000,"source":"kp","category":"money","content":"Despite slowed economic growth, Nepal’s external sector appears stronger than ever, thanks to remittances, tourism and the appreciation of the US dollar.Nepal’s three external indicators—foreign exchange reserve, remittance earnings, and tourism income, which represent all international economic transactions between residents of the country—reached a historic high in the last fiscal year that ended mid-July.Conversely, the country’s statistical body, the National Statistics Office, has projected Nepal’s economic growth to be at a meagre 3.87 percent for 2023-24 due to the poor performance of the internal sector. According to experts, the mismatch is due to political uncertainty and growing corruption, as the external sector's growth did not support the internal sector. “It’s good that tourism income has grown. This will generate jobs,” said Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director at Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank. “But at the same time, growing remittance earnings means no job prospects at home. But the money sent by migrant workers has boosted foreign exchange reserves to an all-time high.”Though Nepal is in a remittance trap, the country could turn this into an opportunity by investing in the real sector. “The best option to channel remittances is to bring the private sector on board for investment in the productive sector,” said Thapa.Experts said that since the interest rate on credit has dropped significantly due to the huge amount of liquidity, investment is all that the country needs now. In the last fiscal year, Nepal’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased 32.6 percent to Rs2.04 trillion, a historic high. According to experts, such a trend in a least-developed country indicates no investment. According to the central bank report released on Sunday, remittance inflows increased 16.5 percent to Rs1.44 trillion in the last fiscal year, the highest amount on record.The remittances have been increasing because youth are leaving. In the last fiscal year, foreign employment permits were issued for 741,302 individuals (460,103 first-time and 281,199 renewed). The number is a slight reduction from 774,976 in the previous fiscal year.Under the service account, travel income, or expenditure made by foreign tourists, increased 32.1 percent to Rs82.33 billion in the review year, the highest revenue on record. The total number of tourist arrivals increased to 1.12 million in the last fiscal year from 862,992 in the previous fiscal year.The balance of payments remained at a surplus of Rs502.49 billion in the review year.With the upbeat external sector, the internal sector has remained dismal.“This is because the private sector investment has been shrinking for the last two years,” said Chandra Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the apex private sector body. He was speaking at an interaction in Kathmandu on Sunday.“As Nepal’s industrial capacity is under 40 percent. The private sector investment that contributes 86 percent to the economy has shrunk. This will naturally not generate employment opportunities.”He said that the demand for workers has boomed in the country, where the private sector has thrived. The World Bank said in its recent report that frequent political changes, a significant drag on businesses for over a decade, have dampened private investment. Thriving corruption and lack of accountability have stalled growth and forced tens of thousands of young Nepalis to try their luck abroad.Thapa, a former official at the central bank, said that with billions of dollars in the banks, the incumbent government has an opportunity to take advantage of it.Nepal is currently ruled by an unusual coalition of the two largest parties and this brings both challenges and opportunities. “The government has to facilitate the private sector. It has to ask the private sector to bring forward ready-to-invest projects,” said Thapa. The capital market is gaining momentum. “Through initial public offerings (IPOs) and follow-on public offers (FPOs), the government can facilitate raising money and enable the private sector to invest in the productive sectors that create jobs,” said Thapa. However, political wrangling has paralysed the country.The Securities Board of Nepal (SEBON) and Nepal Tourism Board have been headless for months. Nepal Electricity Authority has yet to open the door for signing the power purchase agreement with the big developers even though the country has huge loanable funds.“The government and the private sector both have to invest,” said Dhakal. “For every rupee the government spends, the private sector has been spending Rs5.”Economists say that the government’s capital injection into the economy would encourage the private sector to pump the investment.Over the years, private investment has remained sluggish. For example, the import restriction imposed by the government two years ago discouraged the private sector from spending, decreasing capital in the market and intermediate goods imports. As a result, public consumption and investment contracted, ultimately impacting the government’s revenue collection.Economists and statisticians say Nepal, which is set to graduate from the least developed countries by 2026, does not have the environment to achieve double-digit economic growth in the immediate future due to low investment from the government and the private sector.The country’s statistical office recently said that, given the ongoing investment, Nepal’s growth rate will neither slow down nor grow. It will remain static. According to economists, everything from wages to business growth and social security to other state benefits will remain static, which will encourage youth to try their luck abroad.

Health workers at the local unit said that they expect federal agencies to monitor health facilities overwhelmed with infected patients and ensure that preventive measures have been properly enforced.“More than the directives, we need test kits, essential medicines and health workers to care for the patients in our hospitals,” Agam Raj Upadhyaya, health coordinator of the rural municipality, told the Post over the phone from Anbukhaireni. “Neither the Ministry of Health and Population of the federal government nor the agencies under the provincial government have taken the issue seriously, even after a massive dengue outbreak hit the entire local unit.”Health workers in the virus-hit local unit said that over 50 people test positive for the dengue virus daily in Aanbukhaireni Rural Municipality alone. Local health facilities are struggling to cope with the overwhelming number of seriously ailing people. Patients are being treated on benches and even on the floors of health facilities, according to health officials working at the municipality.

Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections and major outbreaks have been reported from many districts. ","summary":"The 500 rapid diagnostic test kits supplied by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division to the Anbukhaireni Rural Municipality of Tanahun two weeks ago were used up within two days.Along with the test kits, the division also issued directives to launch a search-and-destroy drive, mobilise female community health volunteers, and deploy social workers to destroy the breeding grounds for the disease vectors.Despite the rural municipality grappling with a massive dengue outbreak, with over 1,000 positive cases in a single ward within a month, the federal government's central disease control body has yet to dispatch an expert team to conduct vector surveillance. Health workers at the local unit said that they expect federal agencies to monitor health facilities overwhelmed with infected patients and ensure that preventive measures have been properly enforced.“More than the directives, we need test kits, essential medicines and health workers to care for the patients in our hospitals,” Agam Raj Upadhyaya, health coordinator of the rural municipality, told the Post over the phone from Anbukhaireni. “Neither the Ministry of Health and Population of the federal government nor the agencies under the provincial government have taken the issue seriously, even after a massive dengue outbreak hit the entire local unit.”Health workers in the virus-hit local unit said that over 50 people test positive for the dengue virus daily in Aanbukhaireni Rural Municipality alone. Local health facilities are struggling to cope with the overwhelming number of seriously ailing people. Patients are being treated on benches and even on the floors of health facilities, according to health officials working at the municipality. Some patients go to Chitwan, Pokhara, and even Kathmandu for treatment.“Due to a human resource crunch, we have pulled health workers from peripheral health posts to help in hospitals overwhelmed with dengue patients,” said Upadhyaya. “Over 45 patients are being treated in a 15-bed hospital.

Reducing one-third of premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention, treatment and promotion of mental health and well-being is among the UN-backed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets to which Nepal is committed.Experts say the suicide rate is an indicator of premature mortality within the SDGs, which are a follow-up to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).“At the time when the government committed to SDGs in 2015, around 16 people took their own lives every 24 hours,” said Basudev Karki, a consultant psychiatrist. “Now the number has risen to 20. Our government had committed to reduce the suicide rate to 9.7 per 100,000 each year by 2022, but this number rose to 24, and last year it increased further to 25.”The government aims to reduce the suicide rate to 4.7 per 100,000 population by 2030 to meet the SDG targets, but as the deadline nears, more people are killing themselves every day. Mental health experts say people do not attempt suicide for any single reason, but rather due to a complex mix of factors including the rising cost of living and struggle to manage even their most basic needs such as food, housing, healthcare, and job security.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting not only the individual but also families, friends, colleagues, communities, and societies, according to themA study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council before the start of the pandemic shows that more than 10 percent of the adult population had mental issues in their lifetime and 4.3 percent were undergoing some sort of mental crisis.The prevalence of suicidality, including current suicidal thoughts, past suicide attempts, and a future likelihood of suicidal thoughts, was found to be prevalent in the 7.2 percent population.“Even those individuals who appear healthy on the outside could also be struggling with serious mental health problems,” said Karki. “People generally do not like to talk about mental health issues due to the social stigma attached, and lack of awareness. To tackle the growing mental health problems, authorities concerned have to take multiple approaches.”Meanwhile, officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are aware of the growing burden of mental health issues and the rising suicide rate and have been taking various measures to address the problems.“Along with providing free medications for mental health problems at state-run health facilities, we have been taking several other measures that include imparting mental health screening training for health workers,” said Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the division. “We have been working to declare two local units—Palungtar Municipality of Gorkha and Bagchaur Municipality of Salyan—as model municipalities for mental health.”According to officials, various mental health programmes will be rolled out in these local units, including screening for mental health problems and training for health workers, community workers, teachers, female community health volunteers, and others. Awareness campaigns will be launched, and health facilities will be strengthened to provide basic services for mental health problems.“This programme will be launched as a pilot and will be gradually expanded to other local units,” said Thapa. “The main aim of the programme is to encourage the local bodies to take responsibility for addressing the growing mental health issues.

The UN agency defines an international public health emergency as an “extraordinary event” that poses a serious public health risk.“We have also asked concerned agencies and officials to step up surveillance measures and send people suspected to have contracted the virus to the National Public Health Laboratory for the test,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the division. “We also held a discussion with the representative of the UN health body in Nepal and other officials concerned about the potential risk of the mpox virus spreading.”Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus. It is the second time since the UN health body declared mpox a global health emergency in two years, as the virus has spread alarmingly in the African continents and is at risk of entering other continents. The WHO said that 524 people died and more than 14,000 cases of infection have been reported this year alone in Africa, which exceeded last year’s figure.The mpox virus is transmitted through close contact such as sex, skin-to-skin contact, and the respiratory tract or mucous membranes.Doctors say animal-to-human transmission often occurs through bites, scratches or direct contact with infected animals’ blood, body fluids or wounds. The virus causes flu-like symptoms.Nepal had confirmed mpox infection in June last year after a 60-year-old foreigner tested positive for monkeypox infection.Public health experts say that every disease seen in any corner of the world is possible to come to Nepal due to the high mobility of its own people and foreign tourists. They say it is relatively easier for people from any part of the globe to come to Nepal and that it increases the risk of any disease seen in any part of the globe arriving in Nepal.“We cannot keep repeating the same mistake. When Covid spread in China, we thought that since we did not have a direct flight from disease-hit areas, the chance of the disease spreading to Nepal was low, but this proved to be wrong,” said Dr Shrawan Kumar Mishra, director at the provincial Public Health Laboratory of Madhesh Province. “Many people from our country travel to Africa, and our UN peacekeepers also serve there and return home. Anyone coming back from disease-hit countries must be kept in isolation for three weeks.”Experts say screening at the health desks of international airports and land crossings alone is not enough to prevent a possible outbreak of monkeypox in the country since symptoms usually appear between five and 21 days after infection. Moreover, not everyone will have visible symptoms on their skin or limbs. They say that asymptomatic persons can also transmit the virus.Symptoms of the mpox virus include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it. Doctors say that even though monkeypox infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the authorities concerned should not underestimate the risks.Globally, more than 87,000 cases and 112 deaths from monkeypox were reported in 2022, according to the WHOThe UN health body said it is working with countries and vaccine manufacturers on potential vaccine donations and coordinating with partners through the interim Medical Countermeasures Network to facilitate equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and other tools.

They say that asymptomatic persons can also transmit the virus.Symptoms of the mpox virus include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it. Doctors say that even though monkeypox infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the authorities concerned should not underestimate the risks.Globally, more than 87,000 cases and 112 deaths from monkeypox were reported in 2022, according to the WHOThe UN health body said it is working with countries and vaccine manufacturers on potential vaccine donations and coordinating with partners through the interim Medical Countermeasures Network to facilitate equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and other tools.

I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees.

Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. ","summary":"We spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. ","summary":"Once again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution.

The top US diplomat had said earlier that this push was probably the best and possibly last opportunity for a deal.Talks in Qatar seeking a ceasefire and hostage return agreement last week paused without a breakthrough but were expected to resume this week based on the US proposal to bridge the gaps between Israel and Hamas.Blinken’s visit comes as US President Joe Biden, faces mounting election-year pressure over his stance on the conflict, with his Democratic party starting its national convention on Monday amid pro-Palestinian protests and worries about Muslim and Arab American votes in swing states.However, with the Palestinian Islamist group announcing a resumption of suicide bombing inside Israel after many years, and claiming responsibility for a blast in Tel Aviv on Sunday night, and medics saying Israeli military strikes killed at least 30 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Monday, there are few signs of conciliation on the ground and fears of wider war.“In a very constructive meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu today, he confirmed to me that Israel accepts the bridging proposal - that he supports it,” Blinken told reporters in Tel Aviv.“It’s now incumbent on Hamas to do the same, and then the parties, with the help of the mediators - the United States, Egypt and Qatar - have to come together and complete the process of reaching clear understandings about how they’ll implement the commitments that they’ve made under this agreement.”DIFFICULT NEGOTIATIONSDespite US expressions of optimism and Netanyahu’s office describing the meeting as positive, both Israel and Hamas have signalled that any deal will be difficult.Months of on-off talks have circled the same issues, with Israel saying the war can only end with the destruction of Hamas as a military and political force and Hamas saying it will only accept a permanent, not temporary, ceasefire.There are disagreements over Israel’s continued military presence inside Gaza, particularly along the border with Egypt, the free movement of Palestinians inside the territory, and the identity and number of prisoners to be freed in a swap.Hamas officials accused Washington of favouring Israel.“When Blinken says that the Israelis agreed and then the Israelis say that there is an updated proposal, this means that the Americans are subject to Israeli pressure and not the other way around. We believe that it is a manoeuvre that gives the Israelis more time,” senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told Reuters.The current war in Gaza began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas gunmen stormed into Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and abducting about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Israel’s military has since levelled swathes of the Palestinian enclave, driving nearly all of its 2.3 million people from their homes, giving rise to deadly hunger and disease and killing at least 40,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities.PHILADELPHIA CORRIDORBlinken, on his ninth trip to the region since the war began, met Israeli President Isaac Herzog and Netanyahu on Monday. He later met Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and is due also to visit Egypt and Qatar in the coming days.Egyptian security sources said further ceasefire talks in Cairo this week were contingent on agreement over a security mechanism for the so-called Philadelphia Corridor between Egypt and Gaza. The US has proposed an international presence in the area, a suggestion that could be acceptable if it was limited to a maximum of six months, the sources said.In Israel, families of hostages - who have staged protests urging a deal - spoke out again on Monday.“Don’t sacrifice my daughter and the dozens of helpless hostages,” said Ayelet Levy-Shachar on Kan Radio. Her daughter Naama, 20, was captured at an army base.Some at a protest in Tel Aviv held US flags and signs saying “Hostage deal now,” “Hey Joe!

She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. ","summary":"What animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

The Mondays of the month are particularly auspicious, especially the last one. I’m not religious anymore, yet the last Monday of Shrawan (August 12, 2024) became special for me at the Pashupati temple premises. On that extraordinary day, I stood at the sacred podium of a month-long Kotihoma Mahayagya and bravely addressed some 15,000 devotees and hundreds of high-caste gurus, demanding religious reform.A few days prior, at our initiation with some liberal and young organisers of the holy festival, a Shudra, Krishna Damai from Baitadi (who holds a master’s degree in Sanskrit literature), had made history by sitting on the most auspicious chair of a Brahmin pundit and delivering a short sermon. It was the first incident of this kind in Nepal. Traditionally speaking, my presence on the dais would have been deemed polluting. We aren’t allowed to enter the temples and religious events in many parts of the country, even today. These violations of the conventional caste rules vis-à-vis Hindu rituals and customs at the headquarters of the Nepali Hindu religion, as it were, have reverberated across Nepal and probably India, too—naturally offending some Hindus and encouraging others. This has a significant symbolic meaning in terms of tackling the widespread problem of caste hatred and separation amongst Nepalis in the country as well as in diaspora communities. Consecrating Shudras for the first time People may quickly formulate conspiracy theories, and some may even attribute this historical change to the influence of the wave of Hindu politics across the border. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has developed policies and programmes to ensure Dalits somehow stayed within the Hindu fold. Of course, the pundits offering to consecrate some Dalits with the Sanskrit language at the Pashupati Kotihoma must have also felt the urgency to become progressive to contain the rapid expansion of the Christian community here. But it wasn’t really due to the external pressure, nor was it pre-planned as such.Some open discussions on the relationship between religion and caste have started, mainly on social media. There has been growing awareness about the role Hindi rituals and customs play in subjugating Dalits and relegating them to a status lower than a street dog. Once the grand Kotihoma festival began at Pashupati, some people asked why Bahun priests had not included Dalit scholars of Sanskrit, such as Krishna Damai. Eventually, this call was heeded, and young pundits running the show invited him to deliver his sermon.A teacher of the Sanskrit language and literature in caste-infested far western Nepal, Krishna had little experience in public speaking, let alone sitting alongside Bahun pundits and delivering a sermon to a massive gathering of Hindu devotees. Unsurprisingly, he claimed that it was something he’d never even dreamt of before. He didn’t speak for very long and certainly didn’t blame the religious texts, customs and traditional culture for caste discrimination.The contents of Krishna’s brief sermon at the Kotihoma don’t matter. In essence, the presence of a Shudra body in such a sacred and holy space in front of a large crowd of devotees and numerous live television cameras was significant. Bahun pundits were bowing before him is symbolically powerful. It can have a very positive message in spreading views on the need for reforming the religion and abandoning the traditional segregation of the Dalit community—over 90 percent of whom still adhere to Hinduism, rampant humiliation and exclusion based on religious doctrines and principles notwithstanding.Accepted by the faithful What I also found extraordinary was the level of ease with which these changes went down in public. There was no anger or disapproval from the audience at the consecration of the untouchable nor did they show any sign of anger at my loud call for religious reform. The incident didn’t lower the attraction of the religious gathering. It also didn’t discourage people from donating money. There have not been any protests in Kathmandu or elsewhere since then. I’ve heard from hearsay that there has been a level of disquiet within certain quarters of the Brahmin community. Some claim that the whole worship has become impure and worthless as a result of allowing Shudras to occupy the sacred chairs. A few gurus and Hindu scholars are not happy with this dramatic reform. This kind of objection is hardly surprising. Not everybody can easily digest the changes. Like in all communities, there are both conservatives and liberals in the Bahun communities, among the pundits and gurus, too. But there’s a growing sense, particularly among younger gurus and scholars, that these changes are essential; modernisation is a must. Some popular pundits called me afterwards, thanking me for the bold speech still circulating on social media. This is really encouraging. Negative voice of some Dalits The criticism of some Dalits of all people however took me aback. Observing the comments on Facebook, people tend to dismiss the issue of religious reform as non-essential. Some even blamed me for endorsing the Hindu religion’s excesses. Other critics blamed me for becoming a new pawn of the Hindu authorities. Much of the criticism came from men and women influenced by Marxist principles, who believed that a class struggle would also deliver liberation from religion-based oppression. It isn’t difficult to understand why these partially educated Dalits with some experience of party politics appear unenthusiastic about what we’ve achieved at Pashupati. The major factor is that most Dalits are attached to the parties, which are invariably controlled by high castes. These upper caste leaders have designed Dalit discourses and strategies; Dalits still lack their independent ideologies and strategies for fighting caste oppression. Nor do they have their independent organisations and parties. Party leaders have ensured that religion is off topic, as they don’t want Dalits to hit the root causes of caste hierarchy. The Maoists do deserve some credit in the past, who made Dalit fighters damage Hindu temples and slaughter cows. But now, the Maoists have followed the strategy of other parties and remained silent on the issues of religion and culture appertaining to Dalit oppression. When their political masters don’t see any point in religious reform, Dalits don’t see it either. Even though they face daily humiliation and separation based on religious injunctions. But the good news is that a vast majority of grassroots Dalits who have not been “brain-damaged” by Brahmanic ideologies do appreciate the value of the reform at the Pashupati Kotihom. They have no problem understanding that religious reform is imperative for Dalit liberation. They have seen how the communist slogan of a society free from class difference, free from religious belief and practice is a mirage.  ","summary":"An observing Hindu devotes the month of Shrawan to fasting and praying to Lord Shiva.

Other examples of neglected diseases include the West Nile, Zika and Chikungunya viruses. Mpox was discovered in 1958 (in captive monkeys, hence the original misnomer “monkeypox”) and the first human case was identified in 1970. Then for decades it was largely neglected by the scientific and public health communities, regarded as an uncommon infection in remote rural areas in tropical Africa without relevance for the rest of the world.When a massive mpox outbreak hit developed countries in 2022, increased research funding led to a surge in scientific studies. On just one medical search engine, there’s been more research produced since April 2022 than in the preceding 60 years.The 2022-23 global mpox outbreak happened despite repeated calls from African researchers for increased global investment in diagnostic, therapeutic and infection prevention tools for mpox. The WHO has now declared the current upsurge of mpox in central Africa a public health emergency of international concern. This is the highest alert level for events that constitute a public health risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response. We are infectious disease researchers who have worked on HIV, SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections. Mpox’s recent history is yet another reminder that an infectious disease in one corner of the world should not be regarded as someone else’s problem, as it can suddenly start to spread fast and far. It also highlights global inequities in resource allocation and access to vaccines, diagnostics and treatments. These were made available in many industrialised countries and helped curb the global outbreak, but are still largely lacking in most of Africa.The 2022 outbreakThe disease has been renamed “mpox” but the name of the virus, for now, remains “monkeypox” (MPXV). It is closely related to the smallpox virus. MPXV was considered a zoonotic disease endemic in parts of central and west Africa. It was acquired mainly through close contact with wild mammals, especially handling bush meat, but there was no sustained human-to-human transmission. Only very occasionally were cases seen outside the endemic areas, due to infected travelers or import of infected small mammals. This changed abruptly in 2022: a massive, rapidly evolving global outbreak caused over 99,000laboratory-confirmed cases in 116 countries. At its peak in August 2022, over 6,000 cases were reported each week. This outbreak came as a total surprise: most cases were reported from non-endemic countries, mostly in men who have sex with men who had become infected during recent sexual encounters. Even though most cases were clinically not particularly severe and the death toll stands at just over 200, the global outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization on 23 July 2022.Fortunately, case numbers soon plummeted due to a combination of behavioural changes and vaccination in at-risk groups. Modern vaccines and antiviral drugs with activity against mpox were made available in many affected high-income countries. These had been developed and stockpiled in the US and Europe, mostly in preparation for a potential bioweapon attack using a poxvirus. The global outbreak in 2022 was caused by clade II of MPXV, which is endemic in west Africa and not as virulent as clade I MPXV, which so far has only been seen in the Congo Basin. That first mpox public health emergency of international concern was declared over in May 2023. Clade II MPXV infections are still occurring globally, but the worst seems over—for now. Complacency would be misguided, as illustrated by the current mpox outbreak that is gathering steam.Upsurge in AfricaThe African region is experiencing an upsurge in mpox cases which started in 2023. As the continent which includes the areas where mpox has been endemic for a long time, Africa now presents a complex mosaic: Cases arising from the endemic, largely zoonotic, pattern that used to be predominant in the past; cases linked to the 2022 global outbreak, for example in South Africa. Most worryingly, ever increasing numbers of MPXV clade Ib infections reported from the Democratic Republic of Congo. New, more dangerous strainThe current clade I MPXV (formerly called Congo Basin strain) is more virulent than the clade II (west African) strain, resulting in a higher case fatality rate. The ongoing outbreak has its epicentre in South Kivu province, eastern DRC, and has the potential to fuel a large pandemic. It has a distinct epidemiological pattern with sustained chains of human-to-human transmission, often via the sexual route. It may have increased transmissibility (we don’t know yet). The virus which causes it is the newly defined clade Ib lineage. It displays mutations that are the hallmark of human-to-human spread that is estimated to have been happening since September 2023. Case numbers are rising rapidly, even though many suspected cases are likely not tested and thus not counted as confirmed. Complicating matters, a commonly used test was found to miss infections with this lineage of the virus.It affects mostly adults. The case fatality rate is higher than it was in the 2022 global outbreak. Already, this outbreak has resulted in mpox cases occurring in several neighbouring countries, including some (like Kenya) with no previous record of mpox. The challenge is enormous. The eastern DRC is an area beset by multiple problems. This includes natural disasters, violence and infectious diseases including measles, cholera and poliomyelitis for the DRC.In recent years the second-largest Ebola outbreak ever took place in the wider area and, despite the availability of vaccines and treatments, posed considerable challenges.What needs to happenA recent article we co-authored in The Lancet Global Health outlines what needs to be done to contain this outbreak and prevent it from turning into an epidemic, possibly even a pandemic. Equitable access to diagnostic tests, vaccines and antiviral treatments requires political commitment and financial investments. Scientific investigations are needed to learn more about exposure settings, transmission routes and clinical presentations.It’s important to find the best ways to make these interventions. We have proposed the establishment of an African-led, multidisciplinary, multi-country Mpox Research Consortium (MpoxReC) in Africa.It should conduct research towards the elimination of mpox as a public health problem. There is no doubt that a disease in one corner of the world can suddenly become a global heath threat. It’s time the global health system woke up to this reality.-The ConversationRead the original article here.

Already, this outbreak has resulted in mpox cases occurring in several neighbouring countries, including some (like Kenya) with no previous record of mpox. The challenge is enormous. The eastern DRC is an area beset by multiple problems. This includes natural disasters, violence and infectious diseases including measles, cholera and poliomyelitis for the DRC.In recent years the second-largest Ebola outbreak ever took place in the wider area and, despite the availability of vaccines and treatments, posed considerable challenges.What needs to happenA recent article we co-authored in The Lancet Global Health outlines what needs to be done to contain this outbreak and prevent it from turning into an epidemic, possibly even a pandemic. Equitable access to diagnostic tests, vaccines and antiviral treatments requires political commitment and financial investments. Scientific investigations are needed to learn more about exposure settings, transmission routes and clinical presentations.It’s important to find the best ways to make these interventions. We have proposed the establishment of an African-led, multidisciplinary, multi-country Mpox Research Consortium (MpoxReC) in Africa.It should conduct research towards the elimination of mpox as a public health problem. There is no doubt that a disease in one corner of the world can suddenly become a global heath threat. It’s time the global health system woke up to this reality.-The ConversationRead the original article here.

Although the rescue operation began immediately, two weeks of searching yielded only 24 bodies, while 35 others and the buses they were travelling in are still missing. Three of the passengers managed to swim to safety. The government task force formed to investigate the accident submitted its report on August 6 with meticulous recommendations to avoid such mishaps on the highways in future. Meanwhile, 38 other such fatal incidents occurred by mid-July in different parts of the country, killing 76 people in their homes when debris flow buried or damaged their houses. One may ask, shouldn’t the high rate of recurrence of mudslides, debris flow and landslides prompt further investigations to understand what triggers these events so that appropriate strategies can be formulated to reduce risks in remote villages? Heavy rains and debris flowsThe Simaltal misfortune raises questions about the intensity and duration of the rainfall that night in the Sindure Kholsi watershed; according to the investigation report, some eyewitnesses observed heavy rain. Apart from the newly built rural roads, what condition was the watershed’s land in to generate such high amounts of debris? Despite the debris flow possibly lasting for quite some time, we don't have a ballpark estimate of how much. Answers to these questions are crucial for those in other parts of the country grappling with similar problems. After all, debris or mudflows (commonly called landslides) have been one of the biggest and most recurrent threats to lives and property. It mostly occurs in and around mid-hill settlements where natural and human actions constantly alter drainage channels. The latest Solukhumbu flood, which caught global attention, reminds us that we also have infrequent yet devastating floods in higher elevations attributed to glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs)—a different story altogether, including its trigger factor. A cursory look at landslides across the country in 2020 shows how killer landslides have started to defy our general understanding of them. In Marang, Myagdi, the debris deposited in existing gullies during the rural road construction—similar to the one we witnessed in Simaltal this year—flowed down, causing devastation. The landslides in Barekot, Jajarkot, originated from farmlands with no road. At the same time, houses in Lidi, Sindhupalchok, were buried by debris brought down by the failure of an abandoned terrace way above the village. In Parbat and Tanahun, massive debris flow originated from some very well-guarded forest areas above the villages that killed people and damaged houses and farms. In Baglung, a combination of landslides and a series of landslide-blocked-lake-outburst floods swept away 76 houses. While comparing these places is difficult due to varied geographical conditions, one common element across all of these cases is that they were all triggered by high-intensity localised rain, a trend on the rise due to the local impacts of a changing climate yet poorly understood. In 2021, some studies covered heavy localised rain, which deposited massive amounts of debris on the bed of the Melamchi River, rendering the intake of the Melamchi Water Supply Project impotent. Simaltal indicated a similar event on a smaller scale. Numerous incidents of such heavy localised rain across the country haven’t attracted media attention despite causing substantial and widespread damage. The investigation in Simaltal was an opportunity to dig deeper to examine the issues related to heavy localised rain, which would have provided crucial data to understand the changing nature of rainfall.Taming the monsoon runoffBoth the monsoon disasters and water scarcity in the winter, which are worsening, are two sides of the same coin. Increasing localised rain not only leads to further disaster risks but also intense water scarcity in winter since the rainwater that is supposed to seep into aquifers won’t have enough time to do so. The government’s rescue-centric preparedness approach has been instrumental in reducing the human toll—a commendable feat, indeed—but it’s far from effectively preventing such incidents, much less augmenting groundwater in the long run. Addressing water-induced disasters thus should take a two-pronged approach: Reduce the risks caused by heavy rain during the monsoon and find ways to augment depleting groundwater sources to ensure water security in winter. The right time to do both is during the monsoon through the management of monsoon runoff. Except for those located on the ridge area, every village—or even farm—has its watershed from where rainwater flows down through small channels in the form of runoff. When altered, these channels get widened, deepened, or blocked by both natural and human actions and become a cause for debris flow during heavy rain. A doable solution to reduce the risk of debris flow would be to thus tame the runoff by keeping it spread over a wider area, allowing it to accumulate in ponds or converge only in stable channels that have conveyed large volumes of runoff in the past. Revisiting past effortsIn the 1990s, some efforts were made to reinforce what people in the mountain villages traditionally did to tame the runoff and stabilise active gullies and landslides threatening farms and houses in villages in the hills of Lalitpur. It primarily involved three key actions: Appraising the landscape in and around the villages to understand the unique water problems at different elevations due to their geographical context. Then, mapping drainage channels in the watershed to look for places to divert runoff and store them temporarily in multiple dugout ponds. It would cut debris flow risks as well as augment depleting groundwater—a common concern in the hills, which is growing in recent years manifested in the drying springs and rivulets. After that, points of runoff accumulation, along with changes in the size and direction of runoff channels, would be monitored. The results were remarkable. Active landslides and gullies stabilised and became greener—a sign of increased soil moisture—without additional investment. It’s time that lessons from these experiences be reexamined and replicated in at least those places that have begun receiving heavy localised rain to reduce the risk of debris flow and/or villages where springs and rivulets are drying up or have dried altogether.  ","summary":"In the early hours of July 12, a massive debris flow in what was normally considered a small gully—locally called Sindure Kholsi at Simaltal on the Muglin-Narayanghat road—swept two night buses carrying a total of 62 passengers into the Trishuli River, a major tributary of Gandaki River.

It categorises rape or serious cases of sexual violence, enforced disappearances and intentional killings as non-amnestiable, which is a sensible provision. But it allows for amnesty in other human rights violations cases and allows for reducing the sentence by up to 75 percent if perpetrators fulfil some set criteria except in rape or serious sexual violence cases, leaving space for manipulation.

If we continue to make the players dodge the sludge on their training ground, we cannot expect them to return home with international medals.  "},{"hash":"443c585e43b4d9029525793072004e4033586f1454863edd92b804b541973fa2","title":"unified-socialist-can-t-run-like-this-it-s-better-to-merge-with-uml","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/08/19/unified-socialist-can-t-run-like-this-it-s-better-to-merge-with-uml","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/interviews/ramkumarijhakri6copy-1724027372.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1724025600000,"source":"kp","category":"interviews","content":"CPN (Unified Socialist) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri was among the most active leaders involved in the formation of the party after split with the CPN-UML in 2021. Three years on, she is now the most vocal leader calling for a unification of the two parties. Why didn’t the new party perform well, and what made her lobby for a party merger? Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat with former minister Jhakri for more insights.You worked actively to form the CPN (Unified Socialist), but the party couldn’t perform well. It couldn’t even become a national party from the general elections. What went wrong?We formed the CPN (Unified Socialist) out of compulsion. When Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli—who was prime minister at the time as well—dissolved the House of Representatives in December 2020, we firmly stood against his move, saying that it sowed the seeds of political instability. We staged huge protests and moved the Supreme Court against the decision of Oli, our party chair at the time. I was among the petitioners. Once the top court reinstated the House, we expected the party to move smoothly. Unfortunately, that couldn’t happen. The party establishment led by Oli and the rival faction took extreme actions against each other. The agitating faction announced action against the party chair, and the party establishment expelled us from the party itself. When Oli dissolved the House a second time, we protested the move as it brought instability. We were in favour of transforming the party through intra-party struggle, but the situation took some unexpected turns. We didn’t quit the party with a lofty plan of making a new revolutionary organisation. We were compelled to do so.Our new party accommodated many genuine leaders who had been sidelined in the UML. But ultimately, old leaders heavily dominated the new party’s central committee. They were active leaders of their time but were out of touch with the new, changing context. Young leaders didn’t get space in party committees. I proposed recruiting at least 40 percent members under 40 years in the central committee and over 50 percent members under 30 years in the district committees. I made a 29-year-old leader the chair of the district committee in my home district. In 42 days, I attended 36 district conventions where youths in their 30s were elected district committee chairs. I tried to reach out to municipalities to promote youths in the party chapters. But at the central level, old faces dominated party committees. That didn’t attract people to the party or impress the general public. Thus, it failed to gather steam right from the beginning.Many think that Madhav Kumar Nepal’s selection as party chief was a wrong move since he had led the UML for 15 years and become prime minister, and people didn’t find novelty in the new party. Do you think so too?Madhav Kumar Nepal has been the most active leader in the party since its inception. Whatever the party has achieved so far is because of him. But a party leader must mobilise teams with defined roles and responsibilities and continuously motivate and engage them in result-oriented tasks. He works a lot but doesn’t mobilise teams effectively. Observers say the Unified Socialist was formed due to the personality clash between top leaders and that it lacked a national agenda and a clear policy to prove the need for a new party. Do you feel so?Our immediate agenda was safeguarding the constitution and ensuring political stability in the country. We protested the House dissolution guided by the same policy. But when provincial governments were made like satellites of the federal government, we couldn’t play any role in stabilising them.The UML is guided by the policy of People’s Multiparty Democracy, propounded by the late Madan Bhandari. There was a debate on further enhancing the policy in the changed context. A large section of Left intellectuals were interested in contributing to that. We could have engaged them in the process. But our party stopped the debate on that topic as well. We missed the chance of engaging many critical individuals in the discourse and having a relatively different policy. When in the UML, we practised direct elections of party representatives and leaders from the conventions. Unfortunately, leaders of the new party, Unified Socialist, made a statute that gave powers to the party leadership to nominate party secretariat, office bearers and other members. Leaders would pick those who are loyal to them. This regressive approach killed competition in the party.You are known to prefer a more proactive work and decision-making approach. There are rumours that you have been fed up with the party’s lacklustre style and are mulling to join the mother party, UML.If I were to decide only from a personal perspective, I would have done so much earlier because I had multiple opportunities in the past. But I am for party merger because I don’t see any relevance of running multiple retail shops under communist banners because we are not substantially different from each other in terms of policies. Our electoral system has also made it necessary. The Unified Socialist can’t run like this. We must accept reality and decide—merging our party with the UML is better than running it this way. But it seems that the top leaders of the twin parties are still bitter about each other.True, the bitterness lingers on, mainly among the top leaders. We have also made some mistakes. The UML offered some opportunities to the Unified Socialist, and we should have made some offers to capitalise on the favourable situation. At one time, UML leaders proposed our party chair as a candidate for the vacant post of the country’s President. We should have devised our own proposal and made a win-win deal. But we ran away and squandered the opportunity. If Madhav Kumar Nepal had become president on the UML’s proposal, our party might have been reunited with the UML much earlier. I also took an initiative to that end but in vain. Later also, UML chair Oli visited our party chair’s residence to have our party on board the government. But the reaction from our side ruined things. We are certainly not responding to the UML responsibly. Rather than irritate the UML, we must turn each positive gesture into an opportunity for party unity.One more factor is blocking the unity between the two parties. There are a large number of second-rung leaders in the UML who can’t directly confront Oli. They are now encouraging former President Bidya Devi Bhandari to join active politics and trying to make decisions in their favour through her. Oli knows these leaders will support Nepal when he returns to the UML. Why would he [Oli] then merge the fringe party and create another power centre against himself? He knows Madhav Kumar Nepal will challenge him with the backing of the dissidents. It is natural for a leader to think twice before allowing another leader of your stature to create a parallel power centre within the organisation. Even I would have thought twice. This is a major factor hindering party unity.Your party chair and other key leaders seem quite close to CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and critical of UML chair Oli. Moreover, Oli often lambasts Madhav Kumar Nepal publicly. Will they still merge the parties?In principle, our party is open for unity with any Left party. But party cadres won’t join the Maoist Centre. If our leadership decides to merge the party with the Maoists, a huge number of our party cadres will join the UML. Unity between the UML and the Unified Socialist is natural because we grew up in the same background and orientation. But we are quite different from Maoists. Several groups trying to form new political outfits have failed to emerge as a major political force and sustain themselves. You worked in a big party for years and also helped establish a new one. What are the challenges of forming a new political organisation in Nepal?Political parties sustain if they evolve with society. If you trace the history of the Nepal’s Congress and communist parties, you will see how they have evolved over the past seven decades. They competed against each other but joined hands to fight autocratic forces towards establishing democracy. They have done hundreds of progressive things in society. Their major fault is that they have multiple entry points but no exit policy. The only exit way is the death of the leaders. This has caused unhealthy practices and created dissident groups.The dissidents who didn’t get any space within their party formed new outfits. They also amplified negative narratives against the old parties. It happened with the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre. Had there been an exit system in the party, the situation wouldn’t be this bad. But new political parties can’t sustain without their own political ideology and orientation. You may form an organisation, cash in on people’s frustration and achieve some immediate gains, but outfits can’t sustain.But recent electoral trends show that Nepalis are seeking alternative forces and new faces. Can we be oblivious to that?You are right. We have seen such trends in the Panchayat system as well. But garnering votes during elections for one term and establishing a sustainable political force are two different things.  ","summary":"CPN (Unified Socialist) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri was among the most active leaders involved in the formation of the party after split with the CPN-UML in 2021.

But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly. At the end of the meeting, we will make an objective analysis of the overall situation and prepare an action plan.The Central Committee endorses the decisions. But the meetings of the office bearers and standing committee set the agenda and orientation for the party. What have you decided so far? On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution? Doesn’t that violate the mandate the parties got through the elections? Generally, the constitution might be reviewed after 10 years of its implementation. But we haven’t implemented it in a full-fledged way as we don’t even have all the laws required for its effective implementation. We have just agreed to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. So, the proposal to amend the constitution without first completing the basics required for its implementation is wrong. They want to make changes in the proportional inclusive system of our constitution. A political force can work to secure a majority in the House through general elections and ensure stability in the country. We accept that. We have also been lobbying for a directly elected executive president for political stability. They are not ready to debate on that. But they want to revoke the inclusive system, a major achievement of the 2006 people’s movement. This system has empowered historically excluded and deprived communities. We have to enhance the capacity of these groups instead of depriving them of their rights. If there are anomalies in the system’s implementation, let’s develop methods to more effectively pick our representatives. But the ruling parties seem intent on turning back the clock. Some leaders have publicly announced that they want to end the role of small parties. There can be a number of political parties in a country like Nepal, which is rich in social diversity. We adopted federalism for the same purpose. The leaders give priority to their family members and loyal ones while selecting election candidates and blame the constitution for the ensuing mistakes. They want to rule the country indefinitely through a two-party system. So we think the Congress-UML alliance is on the path of regression. Republicanism, federalism, secularism, inclusion and socialism-oriented systems are integrated five pillars of the present constitution. No attack on them will be tolerated. This is one focus of our ongoing meeting. We are also discussing some fresh international issues such as the developments in Bangladesh. We have yet to get a complete picture from there. But we can still learn some things. The centre of global affairs is changing and shifting to Asia. More importantly, there is a strong influence of such geopolitical forces in Nepal as well.Party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that there was an external hand in the recent change of coalition.External elements are active, in one way or the other. Some want to make our country a playground of external forces but our party and party chair firmly stood against it. The forces that wanted various things but didn’t get them from the government then started searching for a character suitable for them. People aren’t aware of such unseen elements but we should be careful. In the meeting, we are discussing this issue as well.Do you think geopolitics is the major reason for the ouster of the Dahal-led government?In his third term as a prime minister, Prachanda was working with certain priorities such as good governance, social justice and prosperity. He had taken governance seriously. Previously, there was a practice of exploiting state coffers in collusion between politicians, big businessmen and bureaucrats. The Prachanda-led government strongly stood against such a nexus. Actions against those involved in Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Bansbari Leather Shoe land scam, and gold smuggling are some examples. The government formulated a law to address the problems of loan shark victims. But some individuals associated with the coalition partners were involved in the scams. Were these bad elements linked to the Congress or the UML? Dahal entered into coalitions with both.The individuals were linked to partners in both the coalitions. The party chair made good governance his main priority but the Maoist Centre is the third-largest party so his hands were tied. When certain individuals were brought under investigation in corruption cases, the initiatives to change the government were expedited overnight. We can conclude that Prachanda government’s anti-corruption moves inspired other parties to oust it.You mentioned external interference as well as other parties’ fear of the government’s anti-corruption actions. Which one was the major reason for government change?The government’s anti-corruption drive is the main reason behind the formation of the new coalition. This drive brought the two largest parties together to form a government, which is unusual in the parliamentary system. The government is working to increase the threshold to secure seats under the proportional representation category. The proposed provision is against small parties, and the Maoist Centre has opposed this. Do you see the possibility of polarisation among the parties on this issue?When the ruling parties introduce new proposals that were not even discussed during the elections, we will definitely oppose them. We led the previous movements for people’s rights and we have to secure these rights. Thus the polarisation between those who want to trample on the statute and those who are against such attacks is inevitable. Is the Maoist Centre preparing to unify with other parties including the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand Biplab?First, we are in the final stage of merging with the outfit of Mahindra Raya Yadav. Also, the Biplab-led party has endorsed the party unity proposal. We have to iron out some theoretical issues and make the party line clear in the changed national as well as international context. Dialogue between us is headed in the right direction.You earlier said party chair has urged other leaders to openly debate issues. Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on.

Dialogue between us is headed in the right direction.You earlier said party chair has urged other leaders to openly debate issues. Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on.

He has studied and written extensively on water resources, trans-boundary water cooperation, flood management, wash services and climate change adaptation, clean energy transition and related policy studies. In this interview with the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal, Dixit discusses river management in Nepal’s urban areas: Where have we gone wrong in this endeavour and what can we do? You have extensively studied river systems and have been following changes seen in river basins. How do you see recent problems caused by encroachment and rampant development activities?We humans have lived and have to continue to live within water cycles: water evaporates from the ocean to the sky and then precipitates to the land and flows via rivers back to the ocean. Rivers that function as arteries of the land surface, sustaining humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems face widespread abuses: pollution, rampant extraction of their bed and banks, fragmentation and degradation. Without rivers, we would not be who we are. Unfortunately, we have forgotten this essence. We neglect and abuse rivers. In 1981, just after the monsoon ended, I, along with my students, walked from Sundarijal to Teku studying Bagmati rivers’ sediment. At many places, we walked on the riverbed. The river then was clean. Gradually, the river systems began to face all-round decay. I have read painful accounts of my contemporaries who remember swimming in the clean Bagmati and its tributaries. In less than 50 years, our rivers in Kathmandu Valley and other basins no longer look like rivers. I feel helpless and ache with pain at this collective failure! What state of rivers are we passing on to our next generation?River encroachment is common across Nepal but more serious in urban areas, including in Kathmandu. How can this be stopped?Our approach to rivers is an imitation of the trend common across South Asia, or the subcontinent, which is again largely based on the knowledge system developed in the industrialised Global North without contextualising locally. The region features waterscapes of high and punctuated rainfall during the monsoon months, rivers, wetlands, ponds, and springs, all connected with groundwater aquifers in one of the most complex landscapes of the world: the Himalaya-Ganga region. Yet, current development endeavours subjugate water rather than respect and live with it. In 2022, the Indus River in Pakistan faced major floods with devastating consequences. Referring to these floods, a group of global scientists stated that “the impacts [of the floods] were the outcome of an outdated river management system.” This approach is primarily based on building of physical structures such as buildings, bridges and roads close to rivers interfering with their natural flows. The approach that began in the early twentieth century keeps marching on even while we are facing twenty first century water challenges.There is an increasing trend of building corridor roads along the rivers in Kathmandu as well as other places. Is this a good or bad practice? In Nepal, road building in the hills has earned the sobriquet of “dozer roads,” meaning politically designed roads excavated by heavy machine operators without adhering to basic engineering, social, environmental, or hydrological safeguards. Even highways built with “engineering,” such as the Mugling-Narayanghat section, face regular accidents. The sliding of the two buses in the Trishuli is the recent example. Building roads along the banks of rivers, defined as “river corridors,” is the preferred approach for improving connectivity. In the Kathmandu Valley, this is also associated with rivers shackled within concrete walls in the name of river beautification. In the monsoon, however, they all overflow as we have been seeing in the last few years and this year as well.What will happen to these rivers 10-15 years down the line? Is there any chance of some of our rivers dying? Or, will the measures taken in recent times protect them?All rivers must flow clean and free in selected stretches. But today, rivers are disconnected with their floodplains. Within walls and embankments, they have become conduits of filth. Many rivers are already seriously degraded. If the current trend continues, many rivers may die. I remember Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, filmmaker, and author, who wrote: “Water and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.” Our current efforts at conserving, developing and managing rivers are grossly inadequate. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw some rivers heal as human actions across the board ceased due to the lockdown. But this healing came at huge human and economic costs. The lessons, however, are clear. We must stop turning rivers into garbage cans for them to begin to heal. The onus lies on us, our activities, our governance, and the policies we make and put into practice effectively. We need new ways of imagining rivers in harmony with human needs. Otherwise, the rivers will die. If rivers die, what will become of us?What problems may city dwellers face as a result of this continued destruction of rivers?A 2020 analysis of rivers in Nepal found that the quality of rivers in the mid-hills and the Tarai are already deteriorating. Industries, cities, towns, and agriculture produce waste that, when disposed of in rivers untreated, cause pollution. Solid and liquid wastes produced by expanding cities and towns pollute nearby rivers, streams, and water bodies. Pollution kills aquatic life such as fish, which are sources of livelihood for many communities. Polluted rivers and water bodies degrade human and environmental health, leading to negative impacts on human livelihoods. The impacts of pollution on rivers are considerable during non-monsoon months when river discharge, and consequently the capacity of rivers to dilute waste, are low.What should be done to conserve the rivers, at least in the present form, and stop further damages?All rivers are a combination of water (W), energy (E), biodiversity aquatic (B), and sediment (S), represented by the acronym WEBS. In the current scheme of things, the focus is on water and energy. Aquatic ecosystems are the concern of only those working on freshwater ecosystems. They are neglected in the larger context though the state has made some provisions for conserving ecosystems. In Nepal’s Hydropower Development Policy of 2001 all hydropower plants must release 10 percent minimum flow to the downstream reaches to enable fish and other aquatic life to survive in the river. A 2021 study of 50 hydropower plants however found that none of the plants surveyed release environmental-flows. All hydropower plants, as per their power purchasing agreements, are required to produce maximum power during the dry season. We should start by accepting the fact that rivers need clean flowing water and respecting the policies we have made. Then we must systematically introduce changes and avoid the oversights embedded in the present approach. The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems. In the present approach, nobody seems to want sediment which is a natural consequence of flow within the water cycle.To meet such an objective, we need to begin with a system of integrated knowledge that synthesises natural science, social science, and indigenous practices. By incorporating fields such as hydrology, ecology, social science-supported context-specific engineering, and indigenous knowledge and practices, we can take a comprehensive approach to water management challenges and solutions. Interdisciplinary approaches can build collaboration, innovation, and systemic decision-making and promote innovative water management for the benefit of both ecosystems and human societies.Do you think initiatives such as river clean up campaigns run by various groups help protect these waterways?I see such initiatives as manifestation of dissatisfaction of concerned citizens with the degradation of rivers and to bring about changes. In 1990, I was part of the Save Bagmati Campaign, which aimed to highlight the degrading state of the river. This campaign has taken many new forms, and citizen groups have begun campaigns in other rivers of Nepal. They however remain fragmented and ad-hoc. Similar campaigns in some countries have led to granting rights to rivers. In 2017, New Zealand recognised the Whanganui River and its tributaries as legal entities, acknowledging their physical and spiritual significance as “living and indivisible” and ensuring their survival, health, and integrity to balance the needs of humans and nature. Promulgations like Living Indus (Pakistan), Namami Gange river-improvement programme (India) can offer lessons for a holistic water journey. The collective voice of concerned citizens for the integrity of rivers can be a powerful medium for policy and pathway changes. Nepal must also begin country-wide river restoration initiatives. We need more dialogue and conversation around water challenges and solutions.As cities turn into concrete jungles, their water tables are said to be receding alarmingly. You often propose redesigning our settlements and development infrastructure in a way that wouldn’t disturb rivers’ natural courses and catchment areas. Could you elaborate?South Asia is a region of waterscapes containing streams, ponds, wetlands, open spaces, floodplains, springs, and underground aquifers. Yet, our towns, cities, and infrastructure are planned, designed, and built to disregard water rather than live with it. As land-centric urban growth dominates, waterscapes temporarily seem to vanish but later water comes back. In Nepali we have a saying “In twelve years a stream returns”. The present practice of urban development is obsessed with concretisation, making these areas impermeable. Rainwater, part of which would naturally infiltrate the ground, now immediately reaches the rivers already constrained by walls. The river at a downstream section immediately peaks and when the rainfall stops the river has very low discharge. Basic parameters, like the intensity of rainfall (mm per hour), are poorly recognised and used in design guidelines. The interaction of current urbanisation practices and increasing extreme rainfall, temperature and humidity rise spawned by climate change and urban heat island effects will make our urban areas as crucible of hazards, and unhealthy. A new urban future must harmoniously integrate nature, including water bodies and wetlands, and preserve natural land cover, including traditional ponds to promote groundwater recharge. It can be further achieved by preserving green open spaces, forests, gardens, permeable “sponge” pavements, and natural waterfronts for healthier communities in sustainable cities. The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving rivers’ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey.

Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. ","summary":"Within days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable.

The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource.
