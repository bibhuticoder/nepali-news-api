In a patriarchal society like ours, women and girls suffer most from social ills.\nLike many other social ills, the child, early and forced marriages are still in practice in Nepal, and particularly prevalent in the Madhesh and Karnali Provinces, which have evidently robbed the girls of their fulfilling life- education and potential.\nIn this connection, a project enforced in six municipalities of two districts- Mahottari and Rautahat of the Madhesh Province has come to a conclusion that evidence-based and broader social cooperation and collaboration could be a strategic approach to help reduce the social ill- the child, early and the forced marriage.\nThe 'Local Systems Strengthening to Reduce Child, Early and Forced Marriage (R-CEFM)' project was implemented jointly for four years by USAID's Breakthrough ACTION and the Ministry of Sports and Social Welfare in Madhesh Province.\nThe finding of the intervention showed the conventional approach of reducing child, early, and forced marriage could not yield the expected result, but a multi-stakeholder engagement ranging from adolescents to social influencers, political leaders, and religious gurus. Despite the claim that child marriage was declining in the province, it was found still prevalent, thereby taking a toll on the education of adolescent girls in the Madhesh.\nR-CEFM Project Chief Shreejana KC shared the finding amidst a programme in Kathmandu on Wednesday. She said that child marriage was still in practice from 35 to 50 percent, but adequate attention and engagement were lacking to reduce it. So, they worked at local levels in Madhesh Province.\n\"Surprisingly, child marriage was regarded as normal owing to social custom, so strengthening of the system was underlined with the collaboration of the Ministry of Sports and Social Welfare in Madhesh Province,\" she said, adding that it resulted in positive impacts that not only made the adolescent girls aware about their rights but their parents also began advocating for daughter's marriage after 20 years.\nThe most important part of the project was togetherness with the local level and Province government to tackle social problem. \"Change in social behaviour was realized imperative to gradually reduce the pressing problem of the child, early and forced marriages,\" she underlined.\nMoreover, generating evidence for advocacy of change in budget and policy to address this social problem was a remarkable achievement over the past four years, according to her.\n\"Incorporation of religious leaders, people's representatives, students, party representatives, child clubs, influencers together with local government to identify problem and seek solution helped reduce the early, child and forced marriages at local levels,\" said Pranab Rajbhandari, Country Manager of Breakthrough ACTION.\nHe appreciated the Province and local levels' readiness and cooperation to reduce child, early, and forced marriages.\nSimilarly, the Chief of Women, Children, and Senior Citizens Section at Loharpatti Municipality of Mahottari district, Yashoda Karki, said the enforcement of the project helped generate evidence on child marriage. A census relating to children's rights showed child marriage was at 53 percent in our local level, while early marriage of girls was over 80 percent.\n\"As a daughter's marriage is a matter of pride and prestige in society, the parents want to marry their daughters before marriageable age. It is difficult to persuade all sides, including parents and girls at once, but gradual intervention helps. So, if we want to change society, investment on adolescent girls along with collaborative measures is must,\" Karki underlined, suggesting expansion of such programmes in all eight districts of Madhes Province.\nSimilarly, Secretary at Ministry of Sports and Social Welfare in Madhes Province, Chudamani Phuyal, appreciated the USAID for the enforcement of the project that helped raise awareness and involved multi-stakeholders to reduce child, early and forced marriage in the respective local levels.\nAs social problems can not be wiped out in a short time, continuous awareness, engagement and capacity building are required. I request the supporters to expand such project in other districts of the province.

The project also fostered the strengthening of child protection system by adopting community-based, multi-sectoral, and data-driven approaches.\n","summary":"\nIrrespective of the political achievements Nepal has made through various movements in the country, the social problems are so entrenched that their reduction and elimination warrant broader social cooperation and collaboration.The social problems are not only the obstruction to one's potential but also the blight to social and national progress. In a patriarchal society like ours, women and girls suffer most from social ills.\nLike many other social ills, the child, early and forced marriages are still in practice in Nepal, and particularly prevalent in the Madhesh and Karnali Provinces, which have evidently robbed the girls of their fulfilling life- education and potential.\nIn this connection, a project enforced in six municipalities of two districts- Mahottari and Rautahat of the Madhesh Province has come to a conclusion that evidence-based and broader social cooperation and collaboration could be a strategic approach to help reduce the social ill- the child, early and the forced marriage.\nThe 'Local Systems Strengthening to Reduce Child, Early and Forced Marriage (R-CEFM)' project was implemented jointly for four years by USAID's Breakthrough ACTION and the Ministry of Sports and Social Welfare in Madhesh Province.\nThe finding of the intervention showed the conventional approach of reducing child, early, and forced marriage could not yield the expected result, but a multi-stakeholder engagement ranging from adolescents to social influencers, political leaders, and religious gurus. Despite the claim that child marriage was declining in the province, it was found still prevalent, thereby taking a toll on the education of adolescent girls in the Madhesh.\nR-CEFM Project Chief Shreejana KC shared the finding amidst a programme in Kathmandu on Wednesday. She said that child marriage was still in practice from 35 to 50 percent, but adequate attention and engagement were lacking to reduce it. So, they worked at local levels in Madhesh Province.\n\"Surprisingly, child marriage was regarded as normal owing to social custom, so strengthening of the system was underlined with the collaboration of the Ministry of Sports and Social Welfare in Madhesh Province,\" she said, adding that it resulted in positive impacts that not only made the adolescent girls aware about their rights but their parents also began advocating for daughter's marriage after 20 years.\nThe most important part of the project was togetherness with the local level and Province government to tackle social problem. \"Change in social behaviour was realized imperative to gradually reduce the pressing problem of the child, early and forced marriages,\" she underlined.\nMoreover, generating evidence for advocacy of change in budget and policy to address this social problem was a remarkable achievement over the past four years, according to her.\n\"Incorporation of religious leaders, people's representatives, students, party representatives, child clubs, influencers together with local government to identify problem and seek solution helped reduce the early, child and forced marriages at local levels,\" said Pranab Rajbhandari, Country Manager of Breakthrough ACTION.\nHe appreciated the Province and local levels' readiness and cooperation to reduce child, early, and forced marriages.\nSimilarly, the Chief of Women, Children, and Senior Citizens Section at Loharpatti Municipality of Mahottari district, Yashoda Karki, said the enforcement of the project helped generate evidence on child marriage. A census relating to children's rights showed child marriage was at 53 percent in our local level, while early marriage of girls was over 80 percent.\n\"As a daughter's marriage is a matter of pride and prestige in society, the parents want to marry their daughters before marriageable age. It is difficult to persuade all sides, including parents and girls at once, but gradual intervention helps. So, if we want to change society, investment on adolescent girls along with collaborative measures is must,\" Karki underlined, suggesting expansion of such programmes in all eight districts of Madhes Province.\nSimilarly, Secretary at Ministry of Sports and Social Welfare in Madhes Province, Chudamani Phuyal, appreciated the USAID for the enforcement of the project that helped raise awareness and involved multi-stakeholders to reduce child, early and forced marriage in the respective local levels.\nAs social problems can not be wiped out in a short time, continuous awareness, engagement and capacity building are required. I request the supporters to expand such project in other districts of the province. Sometimes even the legal hurdles and contradictions perpetuate social problems, according to Phuyal.\nVisual presentations were made on the occasion, showcasing the views of adolescent girls, people's representatives, social influencers, change makers, and religious gurus on the changes and impacts of the project.\nA girl Preetam Thakur from Rauthat district observed, \"Parents may be convinced when we talk openly about our education and career goals, but pressure from relatives and neighbours to marry early remains a problem.\" She further shared positive parenting workshop run by R-CEFM project helped her a lot.\nThakur, as documented in the report, saved herself from becoming a child bride, and was one of the first to be educated beyond Grade 10 and work outside her home in a community where the traditional occupation is barbering.\nDuring the project, as many as 540 psychological first-aid counseling and 2,700 life skills sessions were provided, thereby benefitting a total of 7,800 students.

The pilot was the lone survivor.The probe report said the CRJ 200 aircraft, registered 9N-AME, suffered inconsistencies between its airspeed measurements and takeoff weight. The flying pilot inserted incorrect speed measurements and take-off weight data into the flight computer, causing the aircraft to enter an aerodynamic stall (sudden decrease in lift), which the pilots failed to correct.“The V-speeds mentioned in the flight plan and recorded in the flight data recorder (FDR) were inconsistent with those in the quick reference handbook,” according to the report.The handbook available to pilots in the cockpit contains various procedures for dealing with abnormalities and emergencies.“Also, the speed card of the operator for 18,500 kg take-off weight mentions incorrect V-speeds for takeoff,” said the report.“That means the V-speeds, the specific airspeeds for various flight regimes, were set without calculating the aircraft's takeoff weight,” said a CRJ 200 engineer, who requested not to be named.An aircraft’s weight determines required takeoff speeds, with heavier planes necessitating higher velocities for safe rotation.There are three V speeds.V1 is the maximum speed during the takeoff roll at which a pilot must decide whether to continue the takeoff or abort. If an engine fails before V1, the takeoff can still be safely aborted.VR (Rotation Speed) is the speed at which the pilot initiates the aircraft's rotation to lift off the ground. It is typically higher than V1.V2 refers to the minimum safe speed that must be maintained after takeoff in the event of an engine failure. It ensures that the aircraft can climb safely.The report said that the inspection of the crash site, assessment of 9N-ANM, CRJ 200 aircraft and interviews with the ground personnel of Saurya Airlines revealed that the operator was not complying with the aircraft load weighing, loading and securing of load requirements stipulated in its operations manual.For example, in ATR-type aircraft, the load weighing, loading and securing load requirements are followed, as the crew normally fills the seats in the front rows and only then allows passengers to sit in the tail section to maintain balance. Cargo is also placed accordingly. Also, the disembarkment rule is duly followed.“In jet-type planes, these processes are not followed, and weight calculations are overlooked,” said the engineer. The Saurya Airlines ferry flight was scheduled for heavy maintenance at Pokhara International Airport due to the unavailability of hangars in Kathmandu.The report has blamed the civil aviation regulator for overlooking the ferry flight procedure.The report added that the procedure followed in issuing the flight permission for the ‘ferry’ flight was inadequate, as the obtained records did not show completeness and compliance with the procedure manual for flight permission of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal.The report said that the aircraft sank approximately 130 feet in four seconds. As a result of the blunt impact and disintegration of the plane, the most common cause of the death of persons onboard was blunt force trauma, followed by burn injury.The aircraft underwent a right, left and right banks before the right wing struck the ground.After rotating for takeoff, the aircraft attained a height of 50 ft above ground within five seconds and briefly climbed to just over 100 ft.The report said that one fire vehicle arrived 1 minute 40 seconds after the impact and started spraying water after 15 seconds of arrival. Two other fire vehicles also arrived close to the accident site in the meantime, but they did not simultaneously participate in the firefighting efforts with the first vehicle. Before the July 24 flight, the aircraft had been grounded for 34 days. “The preservation and return to service maintenance checks were carried out,” the report said. During grounding, the aircraft was parked at the remote parking bay on the eastern side of the runway. The plane was returned to the domestic parking bay on July 23.The report said that the maintenance documents are under comprehensive review. The survey inspection for the renewal of the Certificate of Airworthiness was carried out on March 13, 2024. The main landing gear overhaul was due on April 17, 2024. On April 20, 2024, the aircraft got an extension for both main landing gear, valid until June 19, 2024. On April 26, 2024, a flight release certificate was issued based on the civil aviation regulator’s permit to fly the plane. On the same day, a test flight was conducted to renew the certificate of airworthiness.After the expiry of the extension, the aircraft was grounded and sent for short-term storage, where it remained until July 19, 2024.The return-to-service check was carried out on July 24, 2024, in the morning of the accident. The load and trim sheet was prepared before the flight. Load and trim sheet is one of the most important flight documents informing flight crew of the aircraft’s takeoff weight and details of loading, and aircraft takeoff centre of gravity.As per the load and trim sheet, the listed take-off weight was 18,132 kg, including the baggage weight of 600 kg. The fuel on board weighed 2,000 kg. The report said that the review and analysis of information on the load and trim sheet is ongoing.According to preliminary analysis of the FDR data, no abnormalities were seen in engine parameters during the flight.No adverse weather was reported. Data extraction and recovery from both recorders were performed at the Transport Safety Investigation Bureau in Singapore. The Aircraft Accident Investigation Commission has issued three interim safety recommendations.First, all operators shall review their speedcards and regulated take-off weight charts immediately.Second, operators are directed to comply with cargo and baggage handling requirements. Baggage and cargo weighing, distribution, and latching should be ensured as stipulated in the operation manual and ground handling manual. Third, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal has been asked to review and update the requirements for permission for non-scheduled flights, including all non-revenue and ferry flights.

In this period, it quizzed almost 50 people related to the cooperatives scam.The parliamentary panel had also interrogated around 20 people who are in judicial custody in relation to the cooperatives scam. Based on its findings, the committee is writing a preliminary reportOn its last day of interrogation, the special committee on August 23 summoned Rabi Lamichhane, a former deputy prime minister and home minister, and grilled him for over nine hours.Lamichhane and his former business partner Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai are accused of diverting millions of cooperatives money to the Galaxy 4K tv operated under the Gorkha Media Network, which is now dysfunctional. While investigating the Gorkha Media Network database, including its main software, the committee found evidence of Lamichhane’s hand in the misappropriation, according to Lekhnath Dahal, a committee member representing CPN (Maoist Centre). Rai’s statement, which remains to be recorded as he is absconding, could substantiate his involvement, Dahal said. Rai is believed to be hiding in Malaysia since last year. The International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL) in January issued a diffusion notice against him. Rai, the founding chairman of Pokhara Suryadarshan Savings and Credit Cooperatives, is accused of embezzling over Rs1 billion. Committee members claim to have found that Gorkha Media Network, where Rai was the chairman and Lamichhane managing director before he joined politics in June 2022, had rerouted around Rs1 billion to the media company from cooperatives around the country. Lamichhane has denied his involvement in the company’s financial transactions. Lamichhane, however, met Prime Minister and UML chair KP Sharma Oli on September 2. The meeting followed Lamichhane’s interrogation by the Kaski police in connection with the Suryadarshan Cooperatives scam.“For almost 40 minutes after 5 pm, Lamichhane was with Prime Minister Oli at Baluwatar,” Ram Sharan Bajgain, the press coordinator for Oli, told the Post. “It is natural for the leader of the fourth largest party in the House to meet the prime minister. This has nothing to do with the cooperatives’ issues.”Though Lamichhane is also rumoured to have met Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba, party secretary Krishna Paudel denied such a meeting. “Our party President has not met Lamichhane of late as reported in the media,” Paudel told the Post.Meanwhile, the task of writing the report continues. “We are still in the process of drafting a preliminary report,” Sarita Bhusal, a probe panel member from the CPN-UML, told the Post. “We are yet to draw definite conclusions.”However, Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan, another panellist representing the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, said that after the discussion with the lawyers on Wednesday, the probe panel is considering consulting the finance ministry, Nepal Rastra Bank and the judiciary before giving the report its final shape.“Without coordinating with these state organs, no proposed solution to the cooperatives’ problems will succeed,” Pradhan told the Post. “The problem of the cooperatives cannot be solved by holding those who are supposed to return the depositors’ money behind bars.”So coordination between the three state agencies is a must, Pradhan said, suggesting that arrangements need to be made for the detained cooperatives operators to come out and make efforts to return depositors’ savings. Nepali Congress member on the committee Dilendra Prasad Badu said that based on the terms of reference they got, the committee has been busy digging up facts. “We have consulted some lawyers and discovered that there will be no legal hurdles to send our suggestions to the government through Parliament,” Badu told the Post. “There have been discussions with some ministries and we are preparing to discuss the issues with some others.”The House of Representatives, meanwhile, has extended the term of the committee investigating the misuse of public funds by 15 days.

According to the World Health Organization, it is a mosquito-borne flavivirus with the same genus as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The case-fatality rate among those infected can be as high as 30 percent. Permanent neurologic, cognitive, and behavioural sequelae occur in 30 to 50 percent of those with encephalitis, according to the UN health body.Doctors say the disease has no cure, so they provide only symptomatic treatment.

However, officials at the Health Ministry said that there are no immediate plans for additional vaccination drives in the disease-hit areas.“Deaths and infections from JE are reported every year, as the disease is endemic in our country,” said Gautam. “But the number of deaths and infections has significantly decreased compared to the past.”Officials said that in the past, dozens of people would die, and around 600 would be infected by the JE virus each year. Doctors advise taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as using mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothes, and getting vaccinated if one lives in or is travelling to disease-endemic areas.

Traditionally used for sewing, the ‘Dhago’ (thread) is a metaphor for its inability to weave strong connections between family members.Laureni Aama (Ayushma Magar) is an old widow. She engages in casual banter with Bastare Aamai (played by Nistha Tripathi) and Thula (Sagar Dahal). Thula, along with the other villagers of Gauradi Gaupalika, is desperately searching for ways to drive the monkeys out of the village. The entire community is at their wit’s end as the monkeys devour the annual harvest and invade homes, causing widespread destruction.While the monkeys wreak havoc on the village, the play shifts to depict the life of Laureni Aama's younger son in America.Nishan Khatri plays a charming Nepali-American bachelor, Ishwar. Having just completed his IT studies, Ishwar is offered a research opportunity in Nepal. However, his father, embodying the typical Nepali patriarch, insists that Ishwar remain in America to start an IT company jointly. A heated argument breaks out between Ishwar and his father as Ishwar expresses his desire to return to Nepal. After tensions settle, the father reluctantly agrees to let Ishwar go on one condition: he must convince his grandmother to return to the US.Things have taken a new turn in Nepal as Laureni Aamai befriends a monkey (played by Mukti), a regular visitor to their house, to steal the harvest. The relationship between the monkey and Laureni Aamai highlights the special and pure bond that can exist between humans and animals.While Thula combs the village for monkeys, Laureni Aamai secretly starts caring for the monkey. She gives the monkey food to eat and applies bandages to the wound.At this point in the play, metempsychosis is introduced, and Laureni Aamai begins to see the monkey as the reincarnation of her late husband. She shares her sorrow and sadness with the animal. The monkey listens intently as Laureni Aamai expresses her longing to reunite with her grandson Ishwar and her two sons in Kathmandu and America.Laureni Aamai’s belief in superstition highlights the struggles of those whose families have gone abroad to seek wealth. In the play, superstition serves as a metaphor for the old memories that those left behind hold onto, helping them relive and cherish moments with loved ones who have departed. Despite the changing world, superstition symbolises their comfort in clinging to the past.The friendship between the monkey and Laureni Aama depicts the sad picture of loneliness that the families experience as their children go abroad in search of work. The mass exodus of Nepali youth to foreign countries is a recurring theme in plays and stories. Amidst the country’s turbulent politics, the play touches on Nepal's current political situation, emphasising the issue of brain drain.The director may have had a different intention in portraying the monkey, but I couldn’t help but see it as a symbol of the nation’s many issues, like brain drain and family breakdown.The proliferation of monkeys symbolises the saddening situation of our country’s politics, where roads are black-pitched just before the commencement of elections, and the words of the election manifesto are empty rhetoric. Laureni Aamai's frustration is evident in her remark during the play: “Chaar haat tekera vote haalna gako, tei pani kei hudaina,” which loosely translates to, “After spending four hands’ worth of effort to cast my vote, nothing has changed.”Frustrated by the government’s incompetence in controlling the monkeys, the daughter-in-law, Sabita (Mira Khadka), becomes a frequent visitor to the ward office. The ward office finally gives every household a gun to cast away the monkeys.Thula, who isn’t the best listener, takes charge of the gun. As the play's comic relief, he constantly reminds Laureni Aamai to call him if she spots any monkeys nearby. Despite Laureni Aamai already hearing him, Thula keeps repeating himself, convinced she hasn’t listened. This scene is a strong analogy, reflecting how society often treats older people like children, assuming they need constant explanations and guidance.One can see the writing on the wall when Thula gets the gun. The audience's anxiety about the fate of the monkey gets heightened. Right on time, Laureni Aamai faints and, as a result, falls sick.On the other hand, Ishwar is planning to surprise Laureni Aamai with his visit to Nepal. The scene is then followed by a tragic irony where Ishwar’s arrival coincides with Laureni Aamai witnessing the death of her beloved monkey. Consumed by an overwhelming sorrow, Laureni Aamai breathes her last.The play's tragic conclusion, with the deaths of the main characters, mirrors a common pattern in Nepali films, where death is used to elicit strong emotional responses from the audience.The ending appears to be hastily constructed to expedite the conclusion of the play.Stock characters and repetitive scenes in the play do little to advance the storyline. For example, the gainey who comes to sing at Laureni Aamai’s home doesn’t contribute meaningfully to the plot and instead seems to exaggerate it. This makes the audience wonder if the creators envisioned their intended message.On the positive side, the play offers a nuanced portrayal of the relationship between daughter-in-law and mother-in-law. Unlike many dramas, films, and plays that often depict these relationships in a negative light under the pretence of realism, this play shows a more complex and respectful dynamic.The highlight of the theatre was the use of songs as a form of musical catharsis, effectively conveying the emotions the actors aimed to express.Although the storyline may not have succeeded, the actors’ strong, character-driven performances elevated the play to a new level.Kaacho DhagoDirector: Aashant SharmaCast: Ayushma Magar, Mira Khadka, Nishan Khatri Chhetri, MuktiVenue: Kausi Theatre, Teku, KathmanduShowtimes: Every day at 5:15 pm and an extra 1:00 pm show on Saturday until September 14 ","summary":"‘Kaacho Dhaago’ unfolds against seasonal drought, the vibrant melodies of the Magar community, Gandharva dance, crop-raiding monkeys, and an old woman's yearning to reconnect with her family.Written by Mukti and directed by Aashant Sharma, the play centres on an urban village in the Gandaki Province, highlighting the dynamics of a family bound by blood but separated by distance.The title ‘Kaacho Dhaago’ symbolises the fragility of relationships, with ‘Kaacho’ representing their fickleness.

In the play, superstition serves as a metaphor for the old memories that those left behind hold onto, helping them relive and cherish moments with loved ones who have departed. Despite the changing world, superstition symbolises their comfort in clinging to the past.The friendship between the monkey and Laureni Aama depicts the sad picture of loneliness that the families experience as their children go abroad in search of work. The mass exodus of Nepali youth to foreign countries is a recurring theme in plays and stories. Amidst the country’s turbulent politics, the play touches on Nepal's current political situation, emphasising the issue of brain drain.The director may have had a different intention in portraying the monkey, but I couldn’t help but see it as a symbol of the nation’s many issues, like brain drain and family breakdown.The proliferation of monkeys symbolises the saddening situation of our country’s politics, where roads are black-pitched just before the commencement of elections, and the words of the election manifesto are empty rhetoric. Laureni Aamai's frustration is evident in her remark during the play: “Chaar haat tekera vote haalna gako, tei pani kei hudaina,” which loosely translates to, “After spending four hands’ worth of effort to cast my vote, nothing has changed.”Frustrated by the government’s incompetence in controlling the monkeys, the daughter-in-law, Sabita (Mira Khadka), becomes a frequent visitor to the ward office. The ward office finally gives every household a gun to cast away the monkeys.Thula, who isn’t the best listener, takes charge of the gun. As the play's comic relief, he constantly reminds Laureni Aamai to call him if she spots any monkeys nearby. Despite Laureni Aamai already hearing him, Thula keeps repeating himself, convinced she hasn’t listened. This scene is a strong analogy, reflecting how society often treats older people like children, assuming they need constant explanations and guidance.One can see the writing on the wall when Thula gets the gun. The audience's anxiety about the fate of the monkey gets heightened. Right on time, Laureni Aamai faints and, as a result, falls sick.On the other hand, Ishwar is planning to surprise Laureni Aamai with his visit to Nepal. The scene is then followed by a tragic irony where Ishwar’s arrival coincides with Laureni Aamai witnessing the death of her beloved monkey. Consumed by an overwhelming sorrow, Laureni Aamai breathes her last.The play's tragic conclusion, with the deaths of the main characters, mirrors a common pattern in Nepali films, where death is used to elicit strong emotional responses from the audience.The ending appears to be hastily constructed to expedite the conclusion of the play.Stock characters and repetitive scenes in the play do little to advance the storyline. For example, the gainey who comes to sing at Laureni Aamai’s home doesn’t contribute meaningfully to the plot and instead seems to exaggerate it. This makes the audience wonder if the creators envisioned their intended message.On the positive side, the play offers a nuanced portrayal of the relationship between daughter-in-law and mother-in-law. Unlike many dramas, films, and plays that often depict these relationships in a negative light under the pretence of realism, this play shows a more complex and respectful dynamic.The highlight of the theatre was the use of songs as a form of musical catharsis, effectively conveying the emotions the actors aimed to express.Although the storyline may not have succeeded, the actors’ strong, character-driven performances elevated the play to a new level.Kaacho DhagoDirector: Aashant SharmaCast: Ayushma Magar, Mira Khadka, Nishan Khatri Chhetri, MuktiVenue: Kausi Theatre, Teku, KathmanduShowtimes: Every day at 5:15 pm and an extra 1:00 pm show on Saturday until September 14 "},{"hash":"09a1196ee114b363054dd2fd8b494698d7a4b19b71525e66ad2aa5fad3998149","title":"police-round-up-ruby-khan-led-protesters-near-singha-durbar","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/09/07/police-round-up-ruby-khan-led-protesters-near-singha-durbar","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/Untitled3-1725671914.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1725667200000,"source":"kp","category":"national","content":"The police on Friday arrested a group of Banke-based human rights activists, who have been staging a regular protest for a month, as they tried to enter a restricted area in the Capital.The protesters led by Ruby Khan were rounded up as they tried to enter the Babarmahal area as they marched towards Singha Durbar.

But the government is so insensitive that it has no care for justice,\" Khan told the Post. \"We were compelled to enter the restricted area as an attempt to build pressure on it.\"The Khan-led team started the protest as the Nepali Congress and the ruling alliance appointed Badshah a minister, ignoring their warning. The protesters had issued an ultimatum to the ruling coalition for his removal.

The government has made no overtures for dialogue.This is the fourth time they have been in the federal capital demanding justice for Nirmala.The protesters have been claiming that successive governments, by refusing to implement past deals, have proved that they are not accountable to the people and not bothered about the rule of law. United under Mahila Adhikar Manch, Banke, the group of activists has been continuously protesting for over three years for Nirmala’s cause.They first started in October 2021 as a group of 14 people, including 11 women, who arrived in Kathmandu from Nepalgunj, covering over 500 kilometres on foot in the quest for justice for two women victims of murder and disappearances. They had to march to Kathmandu after the local administration paid no attention to their protest.After 12 days of sit-ins and a hunger strike, the government had agreed to investigate the murder of Nakunni Dhobi and Nirmala Kurmi, who disappeared mysteriously in 2010.

He won.One and a half years later, on July 23, the country’s biggest party made him a minister in the province. The Congress has rewarded him, while it is the government’s responsibility to implement past agreements. The Ministry of Home Affairs, currently led by Ramesh Lekhak of the party, has sealed two agreements with Khan: the first in January 2022 and the next on June 25.After around three weeks of protest, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government had reached a five-point deal with Khan in the last week of June. This included completing the investigation of Nirmala’s disappearance without delay. Based on the agreement in October 2021, the government had formed a committee led by Hira Lal Regmi, then a joint-secretary at the home ministry. The committee, in its report submitted to erstwhile minister for home affairs Bal Krishna Khand, had recommended the arrest of, and investigation into, eight people for their alleged involvement in Nirmala’s disappearance.The police arrested seven, who were later released, but they never arrested Badshah Kurmi. Badshah was also a Constituent Assembly member and an influential Congress leader in Banke.With the government’s reluctance to implement the Regmi panel’s recommendations, Khan, accompanied by 15 others, walked to Kathmandu on foot from Banke and started the sit-in in the Capital on November 25, 2021.

This includes the option to either continue working by producing valid job offers or to leave the country without paying any fines for overstaying. Nepali Ambassador to the UAE Tej Bahadur Chhetri told the Post from Abu Dhabi that this move could benefit between 5,000 to 10,000 Nepalis. During a meeting with Chhetri on Thursday, Director General at the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs in Dubai, General Lieutenant Mohammed Ahmed Al Marri, stated that the UAE hosts as many as 10,000 Nepali nationals who are staying there illegally. While Chhetri estimates that over 600,000 Nepalis reside in the Emirates, the Non-resident Nepali Association (NRNA) and other Nepali organisations put the figure closer to 700,000. The amnesty offer will be valid until October-end. The Nepali Embassy in Abu Dhabi, with support from the NRNA and the Nepali community, has set up a help desk in Dubai to help those in need. The applicants who desire to regularise their residency status can apply for a short-validity passport at the embassy and those wishing to return to Nepal should apply for out-pass. The programme was announced by the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs & Port Security (ICP) and will run until October 30, 2024.Under this initiative, individuals with expired visas of all types, including tourist and residency visas, can either adjust their status to continue living and working legally in the UAE or leave the country without incurring fines or facing entry bans.The amnesty also covers individuals born in the UAE without official documentation and those who have absconded from their sponsors. However, it does not apply to those who entered the country illegally.During the meeting with Chhetri, Marri also expressed his readiness to extend all possible cooperation to Nepali citizens in the UAE and the Nepali embassy in case they need help. Chhetri thanked him for providing such an important and excellent plan for the undocumented individuals, which will give them the choice of either staying legally or returning to their home country. Undocumented individuals, including overstayers, must submit their status online, said Chettri. “We have set up a help desk at the embassy to support the undocumented Nepali nationals. And such Nepali nationals have gradually started coming in to seek assistance,” he added. Several factories and companies are providing valid job offers to those who have been working illegally to help them change their status legally. “Those living with undocumented status will be allowed to either return home or continue working in the Emirates if they produce valid job offers,” said Chettri. Once the application is registered online, the UAE authorities will verify the application and facilitate the return of Nepali citizens if they choose to go home or if they fail to produce valid job offers. The UAE government will not charge any fees for undocumented persons, according to Chhetri.“Those who have violated visa norms and wish to return home, must obtain an out-pass. Those who receive the out-pass provided by the local police should visit the embassy to get their travel documents. The embassy will provide free travel documents to Nepalis who want to return home,” said Chettri.The amnesty scheme covers various categories, including individuals who entered the UAE with an exit pass and lived illegally, those who came on visit visas, those who left one job for another without proper documentation, those with expired residency visas, children of Nepalis living in the UAE, among others. The penalty for overstaying a visa is Dh50 ($13.6) per day for tourists or residents, which can add up to thousands, or even tens of thousands of dirhams, according to The National newspaper.Since the announcement of the scheme, Nepali citizens and others living, working, and studying in the country have been rushing to fill the online forms, including providing biometric details, job offers, and other documents to take advantage of the offer, said Chettri.“If someone wants to return to Nepal, we will provide a free documentation service as well as travel documents,” said Ambassador Chettri. “This scheme will benefit us.

After scanning the back cover containing its reviews, I decided to purchase it.I began reading it later, during a tough time. Written by Korean author Baek Sehee, ‘I Want to Die But I Want to Eat Tteokbokki’ is a semi-autobiographical book that captures the author's conversations with her therapist over 12 weeks.The book is divided into two sections. One part features the author's conversations with her therapist, while the other contains her reflections on life after therapy. After each session, Sehee includes a brief self-help monologue, summarising what she has learned about herself.Part memoir and part self-help, this book offers a refreshing alternative that might resonate with even the most sceptical self-help readers.Sehee's book draws from her ten years of psychiatric treatment for dysthymia (persistent mild depression). In an interview with Nadia Saeed from ‘Pen Transmissions’, Sehee shared, “I wrote this book to connect with people like me and to help others in the process.”Born into a humble background, Sehee’s childhood was shaped by low self-esteem. She often compared her modest home to those of her wealthier friends and witnessed her abusive father beating her mother—an ordeal frequently downplayed as a \"marital dispute.\"The book also delves into psychiatric topics such as ‘The Hedgehog’s Dilemma,’ victim complex, superego, faking bad, histrionic personality disorder, akathisia, and more.The book highlights how Sehee’s actions are driven by a constant fear of judgment and a need to fit in. She is socially awkward, craves external validation, experiences emotional numbness, and oscillates between wanting to feel something and feeling overwhelmed when emotions finally surface.At her lowest point, her psychiatrist steps in, offering solutions by uncovering the root causes of her emotional struggles.In a time when seeking help from a mental health professional is often stigmatised, Sehee’s experience helps to dispel that myth.The psychiatrist, however, remains calm as Sehee discusses her problems. Their conversations feel more like those between two close friends, with the psychiatrist patiently listening rather than rushing to offer solutions. This emphasises the importance of simply listening instead of immediately trying to fix things. The tendency to jump to conclusions often discourages those struggling from sharing their issues.Unlike other self-help books that offer a specific formula for dealing with problems, this book guides readers in understanding their emotional turmoil and finding their own solutions.As someone who isn't a fan of self-help books, I found this one appealing because I could relate to what Sehee was going through. The challenges she faces are often not openly discussed.The practice of idolising individuals and attempting to emulate their behaviour takes a big toll on one’s self-esteem. And when we fail to be like them, we feel bad about ourselves. According to the psychiatrist, heightening an idealised standard equals developing low self-esteem. Similarly, the author also discusses her fears of going on dates, driven by the anxiety that others are judging her appearance. In her conversation with her psychiatrist, she says, “Instead of me waiting to see whether the men are any good, I feel like I’m waiting for them to make their judgments on my appearance. The funniest thing is that often, I have no interest in them, but I'm hoping they’re interested in me. Jesus, I really do hate myself; I’m pathetic.\" This reflects the struggles many of us face, with closets full of outfits chosen to avoid judgment from our partners. Despite our personal preferences, we present ourselves in ways we believe will make us more acceptable, conforming to specific standards rather than being true to ourselves.Similarly, we come across individuals who take pride in their parents' achievements and build their identities around them. The psychiatrist explains that people often attach modifiers to themselves, yet these labels can never fully capture who they are. Sehee is no different in this regard. She admits to feeling intimidated by those who attended elite universities, saying, \"I might be having a good conversation with someone, but if I find out they went to Seoul National University, I immediately think, “Did everything I just said sound stupid to them?”Bound by societal and moral standards, it is no wonder that we are in a constant race to act right, speak right, and think right. However, feeling things in a certain way isn't always possible because we are often met with circumstances that obligate us to stray from the ‘normal’ way. To address these issues, the psychiatrist advises Sehee that it is okay to be imperfect and awkward.One does not need to cheer up; whether one does well today or not will be an experience either way, and that is fine. One should enjoy the freedom of one's thoughts. As a reader, I found these words consoling. Having read it twice, the book has given me clarity in life. Therefore, I have no criticism to offer.The free-flowing conversation between the author and the psychiatrist is well-written and does not seem like a monotonous self-help book. The author's real-life experiences enrich the book, making it compelling. Readers can resonate with her struggles, adding an engaging dimension to her narrative.It ends on a hopeful note. The psychiatrist reminds Sehee that even when the heart feels like dying, it often still craves something as simple as Tteokbokki. This reflects the idea that life isn't just black and white; there's a grey area symbolising hope, and it's important to hold on to it.I Want To Die But I Want To Eat TteokbokkiAuthor: Baek Se-heePublisher: Bloomsbury PublishingYear: 2019 ","summary":"While visiting a bookstore, I noticed an unusual book titled ‘I Want to Die But I Want to Eat Tteokbokki’.

Jesus, I really do hate myself; I’m pathetic.\" This reflects the struggles many of us face, with closets full of outfits chosen to avoid judgment from our partners. Despite our personal preferences, we present ourselves in ways we believe will make us more acceptable, conforming to specific standards rather than being true to ourselves.Similarly, we come across individuals who take pride in their parents' achievements and build their identities around them. The psychiatrist explains that people often attach modifiers to themselves, yet these labels can never fully capture who they are. Sehee is no different in this regard. She admits to feeling intimidated by those who attended elite universities, saying, \"I might be having a good conversation with someone, but if I find out they went to Seoul National University, I immediately think, “Did everything I just said sound stupid to them?”Bound by societal and moral standards, it is no wonder that we are in a constant race to act right, speak right, and think right. However, feeling things in a certain way isn't always possible because we are often met with circumstances that obligate us to stray from the ‘normal’ way. To address these issues, the psychiatrist advises Sehee that it is okay to be imperfect and awkward.One does not need to cheer up; whether one does well today or not will be an experience either way, and that is fine. One should enjoy the freedom of one's thoughts. As a reader, I found these words consoling. Having read it twice, the book has given me clarity in life. Therefore, I have no criticism to offer.The free-flowing conversation between the author and the psychiatrist is well-written and does not seem like a monotonous self-help book. The author's real-life experiences enrich the book, making it compelling. Readers can resonate with her struggles, adding an engaging dimension to her narrative.It ends on a hopeful note. The psychiatrist reminds Sehee that even when the heart feels like dying, it often still craves something as simple as Tteokbokki. This reflects the idea that life isn't just black and white; there's a grey area symbolising hope, and it's important to hold on to it.I Want To Die But I Want To Eat TteokbokkiAuthor: Baek Se-heePublisher: Bloomsbury PublishingYear: 2019 "},{"hash":"5cec64bd21bd92f5f000f2db8590fb66aaa0ebab91f95c4b717373e84639b2f0","title":"nepal-s-dairy-industry-remains-on-the-brink-as-unpaid-dues-mount","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/09/07/nepal-s-dairy-industry-remains-on-the-brink-as-unpaid-dues-mount","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/money/Untitled1-1725670697.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1725667200000,"source":"kp","category":"money","content":"Around 1,100 dairy farmers in Dhankuta and Tehrathum in the eastern hill districts have not been paid by the state-run Dairy Development Corporation (DDC) for the past ten months, leaving them in deep trouble. These farmers rely on their dairy income to cover household and other necessities.The DDC owes more than Rs140 million to the farmers in these two districts. The state-owned DDC has been collecting over 3,000 litres of milk through different collection centres in Hile Bazar and Sagarmatha Dairy Cooperative in Chhathar Jorpati Rural Municipality in Dhankuta.When the DDC established its units in the districts a decade and a half ago, farmers were attracted to milk production by rearing improved breeds of cows.Each farmer has invested between Rs1 million and Rs5 million, with most having taken out bank loans, said Prem Bahadur Darlami, a dairy farmer.Bhim Mahatara, a farmer from ward 9 of Mahalaxmi Municipality in Dhankuta, said he was in trouble as he had not received payment for the past ten months.“The DDC has called us multiple times, promised to pay, but no money has come our way,” said Narad Bahadur Katuwal, president of Dhankuta Dairy Association. He said farmers had organised a sit-in protest and submitted a memorandum to the chief minister of Koshi province.Dairy farmers of Murtidhunga, Marekkatahare and Parewadin of Dhankuta and Phulek, Dangapa, Basantapur, Aangdim, Shukrabare, Myanglung of Tehrathum have yet to receive payments.The DDC unit in Biratnagar said it is struggling to sell dairy products and this has delayed payments to the farmers.According to the Veterinary Hospital and Animal Service Center, Dhankuta, there are 125 cow farms and 84 milk collection centres. The district produces 44,098 milk, of which 32,100 litres go to the market.Dairy farmers in Lumbini are having similar problems.Khagishwar Pandey, who depends on earning from milk to meet his household expenses, said his debts to relatives and other lenders are piling up.According to Pandey, the DDC owes him Rs300,000. He said that without income, it’s difficult to cover livestock expenses, too.“I expanded my herd hoping for better income, but now even feeding the cows has become difficult.”Like Pandey, farmers associated with the Siddhartha Dairy Producers Association are also in financial distress.“The government makes lofty promises to encourage farmers. But farmers are being compelled to switch to other businesses,” Pandey said. “Everything is expensive, from straw to feed. How can we survive if we are not paid for our products?” he asked.Bhoj Raj Pandey of Tikuligadh in ward 14 of Tilottama Municipality in Rupandehi district, shares a similar story. He has been running Jesan Krishi and Pashupanchhi Kendra for over a decade, with more than 15 cows.The DDC owes him Rs400,000 in unpaid dues. “I sell 125 litres of milk a day. But there is no support for farmers like me who want to do business in our own country,” Bhoj Raj said.Lekh Nath Pandey, president of the District Dairy Producers Cooperative Association in Tilottama, said the country is not farmer-friendly.“The Lumbini Dairy Distribution Project in Rupandehi owes Rs120 million to farmers in Nawalparasi and Kapilvastu districts,” he said. “Private dairies owe another Rs30 million to the farmers.” Pandey said that despite the potential to be self-sufficient in milk, farmers are not getting paid on time.Yogendra Shah, chief of the Lumbini Dairy Project, said that the plant has been unable to sell its dairy products. “Yet the dairy farmers put pressure on us to keep buying their milk.”“Not all the collected milk is consumed, which is why we have been converting it into butter and powder,” Shah said. “We now have a stock of butter and powdered milk worth Rs1 billion,” Shah said. “If the government provides us a loan equal to the value of these stocks, it would be a huge relief.” Meanwhile, the government has decided to release a Rs600 million loan to the DDC to pay the farmers. The Cabinet meeting held on Thursday approved the fund.This was in response to the DDC’s request to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development for a subsidised loan. The DDC had requested the ministry to put the powdered milk and butter stock as collateral and release the money to settle its debts with farmers.As dairy companies struggle to sell milk in the market, they have started converting it into powder and butter. However, demand for both has dropped, leaving tonnes of the products piling up in warehouses.Both state-owned and private dairy companies said the ongoing economic slowdown has dampened dairy demand, resulting in stopped cash flow and rising liabilities to farmers with products unsold for the past five months.Since December, the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation and private dairies have not paid farmers, and according to rough estimates by the National Peasants’ Coalition Nepal, a group of farmers, the collective dues have now piled up to Rs6.5 billion.Most farmers pay their children’s school fees, hospital bills, and food bills with income from selling milk. Some of their earnings go into buying animal fodder.The country currently produces over 6 million litres of milk daily.

While early genetic analyses pointed to horseshoe bats as the evolutionary hosts of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, no reports had yet surfaced indicating it could be transmitted from humans to other animal species.Less than two weeks later, a report from Belgium marked the first infection in a domestic cat—presumably by its owner. Summer 2020 saw news of Covid-19 outbreaks and subsequent cullings in mink farms across Europe and fears of similar calls for culling in North America. Humans and other animals on and around mink farms tested positive, raising questions about the potential for a secondary wildlife reservoir of Covid-19. That is, the virus could infect and establish a transmission cycle in a different species than the one in which it originated.Researchers have documented this phenomenon of human-to-animal transmission, colloquially referred to as spillback or reverse zoonotic transmission, in both domestic and wild animals. Wildlife may be infected either directly from humans or indirectly from domestic animals infected by humans. This stepping-stone effect provides new opportunities for pathogens to evolve and can radically change how they spread, as seen with influenza and tuberculosis.For example, spillback has been a long-standing threat to endangered great apes, even among populations with infrequent human contact. The chimpanzees of Gombe National Park, made famous by Jane Goodall’s work, have suffered outbreaks of measles and other respiratory diseases likely resulting from environmental persistence of pathogens spread by people living nearby or by ecotourists.We are researchers who study the mechanisms driving cross-species disease transmission and how disease affects both wildlife conservation and people. Emerging outbreaks have underscored the importance of understanding how threats to wildlife health shape the emergence and spread of zoonotic pathogens. Our research suggests that looking at historical outbreaks can help predict and prevent the next pandemic.Spillback has happened beforeOur research group wanted to assess how often spillback had been reported in the years leading up to the Covid-19 pandemic. A retrospective analysis not only allows us to identify specific trends or barriers in reporting spillback events but also helps us understand where new emergent threats are most likely.We examined historical spillback events involving different groups of pathogens across the animal kingdom, accounting for variations in geography, methods and sample sizes. We synthesised scientific reports of spillback across nearly a century prior to the Covid-19 pandemic—from the 1920s to 2019—which included diseases ranging from salmonella and intestinal parasites to human tuberculosis, influenza and polio.We were also interested in determining whether detection and reporting bias might influence what’s known about human-to-animal pathogen transmission. Charismatic megafauna—often defined as larger mammals such as pandas, gorillas, elephants and whales that evoke emotion in people—tend to be overrepresented in wildlife epidemiology and conservation efforts. They receive more public attention and funding than smaller and less visible species.Complicating this further are difficulties in monitoring wild populations of small animals, as they decompose quickly and are frequently scavenged by larger animals. This drastically reduces the time when researchers can investigate outbreaks and collect samples.The results of our historical analysis support our suspicions that most reports described outbreaks in large charismatic megafauna. Many were captive, such as in zoos or rehabilitation centres, or semi-captive, such as well-studied great apes.Despite the papers published on new pathogens discovered in bats and rodents, the number of studies examining pathogens transmitted from humans to these animals was scant. However, small mammals occupying diverse ecological niches, including animals that live near human dwellings—such as deer mice, rats and skunks—may be more likely to not only share their pathogens with people but also to be infected by human pathogens.Covid-19 and pandemic fluIn our historical analysis of spillback prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, the only evidence we found supporting the establishment of a human pathogen in a wildlife population were two 2019 reports describing H1N1 infection in striped skunks. Like coronaviruses, influenza A viruses such as H1N1 are adept at switching hosts and can infect a broad range of species.Unlike coronaviruses, however, their widespread transmission is facilitated by migratory waterfowl such as ducks and geese. Exactly how these skunks became infected with H1N1 and for how long remains unclear.Shortly after we completed the analysis for our study, reports describing widespread Covid-19 infection of white-tailed deer throughout North America began surfacing in November 2021. In some areas, the prevalence of infection was as high as 80 percent despite little evidence of sickness in the deer.This ubiquitous mammal has effectively become a secondary reservoir of Covid-19 in North America. Further, genetic evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 evolves three times faster in white-tailed deer than in humans, potentially increasing the risk of seeding new variants into humans and other animals. There is already evidence of deer-to-human transmission of a previously unseen variant of Covid-19.There are over 30 million white-tailed deer in North America, many in agricultural and suburban areas. Surveillance efforts to monitor viral evolution in white-tailed deer can help identify emerging variants and further transmission from deer populations into people or domestic animals.Investigations into related species revealed that the risk of spillback varies. For instance, white-tailed deer and mule deer are highly susceptible to Covid-19 in the lab, while elk are not.H5N1 and the US dairy herdSince 2022, the spread of H5N1 has affected a broad range of avian and mammalian species around the globe—foxes, skunks, raccoons, opossums, polar bears, coyotes and seals, to name a few. Some of these populations are threatened or endangered, and aggressive surveillance efforts to monitor viral spread are ongoing.Earlier this year, the US Department of Agriculture reported the presence of H5N1 in the milk of dairy cows. Genetic analyses point to an introduction of the virus into cows as early as December 2023, probably in the Texas Panhandle. Since then, it has affected 178 livestock herds in 13 states as of August 2024.How the virus got into dairy cow populations remains undetermined, but it was likely by migratory waterfowl infected with the virus. Efforts to delineate exactly how the virus moves among and between herds are underway, though it appears contaminated milking equipment rather than aerosol transmission, may be the culprit.Given the ability of influenza A viruses such as avian flu to infect a broad range of species, it is critical that surveillance efforts target not only dairy cows but also animals living on or around affected farms. Monitoring high-risk areas for cross-species transmission, such as where livestock, wildlife and people interact, provides information not only about how widespread a disease is in a given population—in this case, dairy cows—but also allows researchers to identify susceptible species that come into contact with them.To date, H5N1 has been detected in several animals found dead on affected dairy farms, including cats, birds and a raccoon. As of August 2024, four people in close contact with infected dairy cows have tested positive, one of whom developed respiratory symptoms. Other wildlife and domestic animal species are still at risk. Similar surveillance efforts are underway to monitor H5N1 transmission from poultry to humans.One part of the networkThe language often used to describe cross-species transmission fails to encapsulate its complexity and nuances. Given the number of species that have been infected with Covid-19 throughout the pandemic, many scientists have called for limiting the use of the terms spillover and spillback because they describe the transmission of pathogens to and from humans. This suggests that disease and its implications begin and end with humans.Considering humans as one node in a large network of transmission possibilities can help researchers more effectively monitor Covid-19, H5N1 and other emerging zoonoses. This includes systems-thinking approaches such as One Health or Planetary Health that capture human interdependence with the health of the total environment.Fagre is a Veterinary Microbiologist and Wildlife Epidemiologist at Colorado State University.Ryan is a Professor of Medical Geography at the University of Florida—The Conversation ","summary":"When the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, humans had been the only species with reported cases of the disease.

Genetic analyses point to an introduction of the virus into cows as early as December 2023, probably in the Texas Panhandle. Since then, it has affected 178 livestock herds in 13 states as of August 2024.How the virus got into dairy cow populations remains undetermined, but it was likely by migratory waterfowl infected with the virus. Efforts to delineate exactly how the virus moves among and between herds are underway, though it appears contaminated milking equipment rather than aerosol transmission, may be the culprit.Given the ability of influenza A viruses such as avian flu to infect a broad range of species, it is critical that surveillance efforts target not only dairy cows but also animals living on or around affected farms. Monitoring high-risk areas for cross-species transmission, such as where livestock, wildlife and people interact, provides information not only about how widespread a disease is in a given population—in this case, dairy cows—but also allows researchers to identify susceptible species that come into contact with them.To date, H5N1 has been detected in several animals found dead on affected dairy farms, including cats, birds and a raccoon. As of August 2024, four people in close contact with infected dairy cows have tested positive, one of whom developed respiratory symptoms. Other wildlife and domestic animal species are still at risk. Similar surveillance efforts are underway to monitor H5N1 transmission from poultry to humans.One part of the networkThe language often used to describe cross-species transmission fails to encapsulate its complexity and nuances. Given the number of species that have been infected with Covid-19 throughout the pandemic, many scientists have called for limiting the use of the terms spillover and spillback because they describe the transmission of pathogens to and from humans. This suggests that disease and its implications begin and end with humans.Considering humans as one node in a large network of transmission possibilities can help researchers more effectively monitor Covid-19, H5N1 and other emerging zoonoses. This includes systems-thinking approaches such as One Health or Planetary Health that capture human interdependence with the health of the total environment.Fagre is a Veterinary Microbiologist and Wildlife Epidemiologist at Colorado State University.Ryan is a Professor of Medical Geography at the University of Florida—The Conversation "},{"hash":"51b23ea8864878550e760b8bbaf54841c8d16f244e1a2a3dc519100f7478b9b9","title":"leadership-transition","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/09/06/leadership-transition","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/leadpostillustration-1725584287.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1725580800000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"Politics is the art of possibilities, shaped by the alignment of interests and events. Nepali politics appears to be undergoing a unique alignment, which could pave the way for a gender or generational leadership change.In 2000, despite the raging Maoist insurgency, the notion of Nepal becoming a republic or electing a constituent assembly seemed almost unimaginable. Then came the royal family massacre, followed by King Gyanendra’s direct rule and his misreading of geopolitical red lines. Seven years later, Nepal became a republic, and the first election for the constituent assembly was held the year after.Following Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba’s first visit to India last month, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli expressed his desire to hand over the reins to a female prime minister. While political rhetoric should be taken with a grain of salt, this development coincides with other events, making it conducive for a significant leadership change in Nepali politics.Term limitsWithin the Nepali Congress, the two general secretaries, Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma, have been pushing for party reforms and renewal, often in lonely endeavours against the wishes of the party establishment. Sharma has introduced a proposal to implement term limits for party leaders—what he interestingly calls an ‘exit policy.’ Perhaps it should be termed a ‘graceful exit policy’ to incentivise retirement for the party's senior leadership. Unsurprisingly, the proposal isn’t popular with the party leadership, though the rank-and-file support it.The proposal is simple, with a two-term limit for party leaders who become prime ministers, a one-term limit for those who become president and a four-term limit for members of parliament. Party President Sher Bahadur Deuba was quoted as saying that he won’t step down just because someone says so. Behind closed doors, one can imagine the exchange being expletive-laden in typical Deuba style.Say what you will about the Nepali Congress, but one must appreciate the space for internal democracy and dissent. The fact that this discourse has officially started as a proposal in the party’s decision-making body suggests its potential to gather momentum. It is not a fringe comment anymore. The proposal could come to fruition with the right coalition-building within the party and beyond.Instead of outright rejection of the proposal, the discussion in the Nepali Congress has evolved towards linking this to a constitutional reform. I believe that is the proper approach to introducing term limits. Anchoring it in the constitution would make it stronger than just having it in the bylaw of a party—which can be easily violated or amended. This would also make it mandatory for all parties, guaranteeing a continuous process of political renewal that is healthy for any democracy. Unlike presidential systems or directly elected executives, most countries that have adopted the Westminster system have failed to introduce term limits. As an Austria-based political science professor, Ludger Helms points out in his work on leadership transitions, autocratic or semi-autocratic regimes are often better at introducing and executing term limits than democracies, as they form a central element of the power-sharing compact among the ruling elite.Staying relevantThe old parties are under immense pressure to stay relevant even though they might not admit or verbalise it. Public scrutiny in this social media age is hard to ignore, and their continuing dismal performance, compounded by competition from newer parties, has created an appetite for reforms within party leadership to counter this threat. This is why there’s all this talk of constitutional reform—less than 10 years after the promulgation of the current constitution. The tendency for limited reform offers a strategic opening with wider implications for institutionalising regular democratic successions and leadership transitions that are in tune with public sentiment.Seizing the moment requires building a coalition that frames the transition as a graceful retirement for top leaders while allowing them some control, including the ability to select their ‘heir apparent’ during the succession period.NumbersMany would want to see Thapa or Sharma as the next prime ministerial nominee from the Nepali Congress.

The first and foremost is how to sustain a livelihood and earn enough. Talent alone isn't enough to thrive—financial support is crucial. Without it, an artist can only reach so far. The passion for working with colours and creating something meaningful in life may not be sufficient.A popular example of this discussion is the Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh. Throughout his short life, he remained poverty-stricken, even though his works are considered the foundations of modern art. His prowess was realised after he had passed on. His paintings are priced at over one hundred million today. Another famous artist who lived quite a contrary life was Pablo Picasso. He earned enough and spent lavishly. An article in Vanity Fair reported that when he died, he left behind property worth millions of dollars.So, what does it take to make it in an unconventional field like art? How can artists make their mark in this evolving landscape and earn enough to keep at it? Artist Seema Sharma Shah studied painting. In 1998, she earned a PhD in History of Art from Banaras Hindu University. She has displayed her artworks in more than 70 shows in Japan, Korea, the USA, the UK, the Netherlands, France, India, Nepal and more. With her vast experience, she tells me, “If someone passionately and dedicatedly pursues art as a career, this can be a stable means of income,” however, she adds, “The same might not be true for people who pursue art as a hobby.” In her conversations with Nepali artists, she learned that many have made art a way of life and have succeeded. This became possible only recently because “the market has begun to understand the value of art,” she says. Analysing the art scene in Nepal, she says that many prospective buyers today look for originality in an artist’s work, and a copy of a foreign style is not entertained. “If an artist's work connects with the audience and communicates in a way that ordinary people can understand, that is the key to sustainability,” she says, who currently works as an Associate Professor at the Central Department of Fine Arts at Tribhuvan University. When I asked Shubha Joshi if sustaining life through art was possible, she told me the question took her back to 2015. Her family had raised the same question back then when she decided to study for a Bachelor’s degree in Fine Arts. “But today, things have changed,” she says, who graduated from Kathmandu University, School of Arts with a major in graphic communication in 2019.“I feel that today, more young professionals, whether artists or not, are embracing careers that are exploratory and not strictly planned,” she says. Having studied fine arts, she has observed many of her peers carving out their paths in the art world. “I believe that artists carry technical skills, and a lot of them are transferable, which they can use to their advantage when finding work,” she tells me, who currently works as an illustrator and a graphic designer.Graduates in graphic communications often work in offices or design agencies in roles like graphic designers and UI/UX designers, while studio graduates often work in open galleries or pursue freelance work such as storyboarding, animation, or creating customised art. Joshi says she has worked with startups, design agencies, art galleries, publishers, and NGOs. She also tried selling some of her art prints on the market, but the return was disappointing.“People’s mindset regarding art is progressive, but the Nepali art market is slow in growth,” she says, adding that sustaining a career in this field is possible with adaptability, communication, and creativity. Contemporary Thangka painter Sahil Bhopal earns enough for himself but isn't sure the same income will suffice when he marries and starts a family. Also, he believes it can be difficult for artists like him to gather a large sum of money in medical emergencies.Bhopal’s primary source of income is through thangka paintings. He spent seven years living and studying at the Shambhala Art School within the Drukpa Kagyu monastery, Dechen Chokhor, in Himachal Pradesh. “Thangka revolves around Buddhist teachings and practices and is an essential component of Tibetan Buddhism, used for teachings, meditation, and other practices,” he says. However, the time-consuming nature of thangka creation and having to put in extensive work hours means one can only complete so many paintings.In his experience, sustaining life solely through art can be difficult, but some art forms can be more sellable than others. “While contemporary themes intrigue me, traditional themes offer a higher likelihood of sustainability and support,” he says. He believes the traditional style instils discipline, and the art form’s charm helps artists earn well.He notes that every sector has its upsides and downsides. To move forward, one must face both these factors. One can navigate this field's challenges with dedication, perseverance, and patience.

The first and foremost is how to sustain a livelihood and earn enough. Talent alone isn't enough to thrive—financial support is crucial. Without it, an artist can only reach so far. The passion for working with colours and creating something meaningful in life may not be sufficient.A popular example of this discussion is the Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh. Throughout his short life, he remained poverty-stricken, even though his works are considered the foundations of modern art. His prowess was realised after he had passed on. His paintings are priced at over one hundred million today. Another famous artist who lived quite a contrary life was Pablo Picasso. He earned enough and spent lavishly. An article in Vanity Fair reported that when he died, he left behind property worth millions of dollars.So, what does it take to make it in an unconventional field like art? How can artists make their mark in this evolving landscape and earn enough to keep at it? Artist Seema Sharma Shah studied painting. In 1998, she earned a PhD in History of Art from Banaras Hindu University. She has displayed her artworks in more than 70 shows in Japan, Korea, the USA, the UK, the Netherlands, France, India, Nepal and more. With her vast experience, she tells me, “If someone passionately and dedicatedly pursues art as a career, this can be a stable means of income,” however, she adds, “The same might not be true for people who pursue art as a hobby.” In her conversations with Nepali artists, she learned that many have made art a way of life and have succeeded. This became possible only recently because “the market has begun to understand the value of art,” she says. Analysing the art scene in Nepal, she says that many prospective buyers today look for originality in an artist’s work, and a copy of a foreign style is not entertained. “If an artist's work connects with the audience and communicates in a way that ordinary people can understand, that is the key to sustainability,” she says, who currently works as an Associate Professor at the Central Department of Fine Arts at Tribhuvan University. When I asked Shubha Joshi if sustaining life through art was possible, she told me the question took her back to 2015. Her family had raised the same question back then when she decided to study for a Bachelor’s degree in Fine Arts. “But today, things have changed,” she says, who graduated from Kathmandu University, School of Arts with a major in graphic communication in 2019.“I feel that today, more young professionals, whether artists or not, are embracing careers that are exploratory and not strictly planned,” she says. Having studied fine arts, she has observed many of her peers carving out their paths in the art world. “I believe that artists carry technical skills, and a lot of them are transferable, which they can use to their advantage when finding work,” she tells me, who currently works as an illustrator and a graphic designer.Graduates in graphic communications often work in offices or design agencies in roles like graphic designers and UI/UX designers, while studio graduates often work in open galleries or pursue freelance work such as storyboarding, animation, or creating customised art. Joshi says she has worked with startups, design agencies, art galleries, publishers, and NGOs. She also tried selling some of her art prints on the market, but the return was disappointing.“People’s mindset regarding art is progressive, but the Nepali art market is slow in growth,” she says, adding that sustaining a career in this field is possible with adaptability, communication, and creativity. Contemporary Thangka painter Sahil Bhopal earns enough for himself but isn't sure the same income will suffice when he marries and starts a family. Also, he believes it can be difficult for artists like him to gather a large sum of money in medical emergencies.Bhopal’s primary source of income is through thangka paintings. He spent seven years living and studying at the Shambhala Art School within the Drukpa Kagyu monastery, Dechen Chokhor, in Himachal Pradesh. “Thangka revolves around Buddhist teachings and practices and is an essential component of Tibetan Buddhism, used for teachings, meditation, and other practices,” he says. However, the time-consuming nature of thangka creation and having to put in extensive work hours means one can only complete so many paintings.In his experience, sustaining life solely through art can be difficult, but some art forms can be more sellable than others. “While contemporary themes intrigue me, traditional themes offer a higher likelihood of sustainability and support,” he says. He believes the traditional style instils discipline, and the art form’s charm helps artists earn well.He notes that every sector has its upsides and downsides. To move forward, one must face both these factors. One can navigate this field's challenges with dedication, perseverance, and patience.

The U.S. is preparing to present a new ceasefire proposal to hammer out differences, but prospects of a breakthrough remain dim as gaps between the sides remain wide.On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that it was incumbent on both Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas to say yes on remaining issues to reach a Gaza ceasefire deal.Nearly 90% of the Gaza ceasefire deal is agreed but critical issues remain where there are gaps, including the so-called Philadelphi corridor along Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, Blinken told a press briefing.

She said UNRWA was working with UNICEF, the World Health Organization and local health partners around the clock and in a race against time to vaccinate every child across the Gaza Strip.“These temporary pauses do not however replace our calls for a ceasefire, it’s long overdue. It’s time to reach a deal that would bring respite for the people in Gaza, release all hostages and bring in a steady flow of commercial and humanitarian supplies into Gaza,” Touma told Reuters.The campaign will shift on Sunday to the northern Gaza Strip, which has been the focus of the major Israeli military offensive in the past 11 months. According to the World Health Organization, a second round of vaccinations would be required four weeks after the first round.The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered last Oct. 7 when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Israel’s subsequent assault on the Hamas-governed enclave has since killed over 40,800 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while also displacing nearly the entire population of 2.3 million, causing a hunger crisis and leading to genocide allegations at the World Court that Israel denies.According to the United Nations, at least 1.9 million people - or nine in 10 -across the Gaza Strip are internally displaced, including people who have uprooted up to 10 times or more.

According to experts, the mismatch is due to political uncertainty and growing corruption, as the external sector's growth did not support the internal sector. “It’s good that tourism income has grown. This will generate jobs,” said Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director at Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank. “But at the same time, growing remittance earnings means no job prospects at home. But the money sent by migrant workers has boosted foreign exchange reserves to an all-time high.”Though Nepal is in a remittance trap, the country could turn this into an opportunity by investing in the real sector. “The best option to channel remittances is to bring the private sector on board for investment in the productive sector,” said Thapa.Experts said that since the interest rate on credit has dropped significantly due to the huge amount of liquidity, investment is all that the country needs now. In the last fiscal year, Nepal’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased 32.6 percent to Rs2.04 trillion, a historic high. According to experts, such a trend in a least-developed country indicates no investment. According to the central bank report released on Sunday, remittance inflows increased 16.5 percent to Rs1.44 trillion in the last fiscal year, the highest amount on record.The remittances have been increasing because youth are leaving. In the last fiscal year, foreign employment permits were issued for 741,302 individuals (460,103 first-time and 281,199 renewed). The number is a slight reduction from 774,976 in the previous fiscal year.Under the service account, travel income, or expenditure made by foreign tourists, increased 32.1 percent to Rs82.33 billion in the review year, the highest revenue on record. The total number of tourist arrivals increased to 1.12 million in the last fiscal year from 862,992 in the previous fiscal year.The balance of payments remained at a surplus of Rs502.49 billion in the review year.With the upbeat external sector, the internal sector has remained dismal.“This is because the private sector investment has been shrinking for the last two years,” said Chandra Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the apex private sector body. He was speaking at an interaction in Kathmandu on Sunday.“As Nepal’s industrial capacity is under 40 percent. The private sector investment that contributes 86 percent to the economy has shrunk. This will naturally not generate employment opportunities.”He said that the demand for workers has boomed in the country, where the private sector has thrived. The World Bank said in its recent report that frequent political changes, a significant drag on businesses for over a decade, have dampened private investment. Thriving corruption and lack of accountability have stalled growth and forced tens of thousands of young Nepalis to try their luck abroad.Thapa, a former official at the central bank, said that with billions of dollars in the banks, the incumbent government has an opportunity to take advantage of it.Nepal is currently ruled by an unusual coalition of the two largest parties and this brings both challenges and opportunities. “The government has to facilitate the private sector. It has to ask the private sector to bring forward ready-to-invest projects,” said Thapa. The capital market is gaining momentum. “Through initial public offerings (IPOs) and follow-on public offers (FPOs), the government can facilitate raising money and enable the private sector to invest in the productive sectors that create jobs,” said Thapa. However, political wrangling has paralysed the country.The Securities Board of Nepal (SEBON) and Nepal Tourism Board have been headless for months. Nepal Electricity Authority has yet to open the door for signing the power purchase agreement with the big developers even though the country has huge loanable funds.“The government and the private sector both have to invest,” said Dhakal. “For every rupee the government spends, the private sector has been spending Rs5.”Economists say that the government’s capital injection into the economy would encourage the private sector to pump the investment.Over the years, private investment has remained sluggish. For example, the import restriction imposed by the government two years ago discouraged the private sector from spending, decreasing capital in the market and intermediate goods imports. As a result, public consumption and investment contracted, ultimately impacting the government’s revenue collection.Economists and statisticians say Nepal, which is set to graduate from the least developed countries by 2026, does not have the environment to achieve double-digit economic growth in the immediate future due to low investment from the government and the private sector.The country’s statistical office recently said that, given the ongoing investment, Nepal’s growth rate will neither slow down nor grow. It will remain static. According to economists, everything from wages to business growth and social security to other state benefits will remain static, which will encourage youth to try their luck abroad.

But the money sent by migrant workers has boosted foreign exchange reserves to an all-time high.”Though Nepal is in a remittance trap, the country could turn this into an opportunity by investing in the real sector. “The best option to channel remittances is to bring the private sector on board for investment in the productive sector,” said Thapa.Experts said that since the interest rate on credit has dropped significantly due to the huge amount of liquidity, investment is all that the country needs now. In the last fiscal year, Nepal’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased 32.6 percent to Rs2.04 trillion, a historic high. According to experts, such a trend in a least-developed country indicates no investment. According to the central bank report released on Sunday, remittance inflows increased 16.5 percent to Rs1.44 trillion in the last fiscal year, the highest amount on record.The remittances have been increasing because youth are leaving. In the last fiscal year, foreign employment permits were issued for 741,302 individuals (460,103 first-time and 281,199 renewed). The number is a slight reduction from 774,976 in the previous fiscal year.Under the service account, travel income, or expenditure made by foreign tourists, increased 32.1 percent to Rs82.33 billion in the review year, the highest revenue on record. The total number of tourist arrivals increased to 1.12 million in the last fiscal year from 862,992 in the previous fiscal year.The balance of payments remained at a surplus of Rs502.49 billion in the review year.With the upbeat external sector, the internal sector has remained dismal.“This is because the private sector investment has been shrinking for the last two years,” said Chandra Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the apex private sector body. He was speaking at an interaction in Kathmandu on Sunday.“As Nepal’s industrial capacity is under 40 percent. The private sector investment that contributes 86 percent to the economy has shrunk. This will naturally not generate employment opportunities.”He said that the demand for workers has boomed in the country, where the private sector has thrived. The World Bank said in its recent report that frequent political changes, a significant drag on businesses for over a decade, have dampened private investment. Thriving corruption and lack of accountability have stalled growth and forced tens of thousands of young Nepalis to try their luck abroad.Thapa, a former official at the central bank, said that with billions of dollars in the banks, the incumbent government has an opportunity to take advantage of it.Nepal is currently ruled by an unusual coalition of the two largest parties and this brings both challenges and opportunities. “The government has to facilitate the private sector. It has to ask the private sector to bring forward ready-to-invest projects,” said Thapa. The capital market is gaining momentum. “Through initial public offerings (IPOs) and follow-on public offers (FPOs), the government can facilitate raising money and enable the private sector to invest in the productive sectors that create jobs,” said Thapa. However, political wrangling has paralysed the country.The Securities Board of Nepal (SEBON) and Nepal Tourism Board have been headless for months. Nepal Electricity Authority has yet to open the door for signing the power purchase agreement with the big developers even though the country has huge loanable funds.“The government and the private sector both have to invest,” said Dhakal. “For every rupee the government spends, the private sector has been spending Rs5.”Economists say that the government’s capital injection into the economy would encourage the private sector to pump the investment.Over the years, private investment has remained sluggish. For example, the import restriction imposed by the government two years ago discouraged the private sector from spending, decreasing capital in the market and intermediate goods imports. As a result, public consumption and investment contracted, ultimately impacting the government’s revenue collection.Economists and statisticians say Nepal, which is set to graduate from the least developed countries by 2026, does not have the environment to achieve double-digit economic growth in the immediate future due to low investment from the government and the private sector.The country’s statistical office recently said that, given the ongoing investment, Nepal’s growth rate will neither slow down nor grow. It will remain static. According to economists, everything from wages to business growth and social security to other state benefits will remain static, which will encourage youth to try their luck abroad.

Besides, as Nepal’s e-commerce grows, now more than ever, instances of consumers fraud are becoming more prevalent.Nepal’s quality control watchdog, the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control, filed 178 cases in district administration offices against producers and traders for producing and selling substandard food items and animal feed in the last fiscal year. There were 121 cases in the previous fiscal year. Consumer rights activists say the district administrations deliver justice in only a handful of cases.Speaking at the interaction, lawmakers criticised party politics for protecting wrongdoers.They said that whenever market inspection teams raid certain shops or factories, top officials receive phone calls to protect those businesses. On May 28, the budget announced the allocation of necessary funds to set up consumer courts. An official at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies said that the government allocated a budget of Rs10 million for administrative expenses to establish at least one consumer court in one of the districts in Kathmandu Valley. However, setting up consumer courts requires a considerable amount of money. As a temporary measure to comply with the Supreme Court’s order, officials plan to rent a separate room in a district administration office to set up the court, which will then begin hearing cases.Consumer rights activists said that forming a court within a month is impossible.“I attended the function when the industry minister Bhandari delivered his speech. We applauded, and the function concluded,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumers Forum.“This is one of the glaring examples of how promises are made and not delivered.”“A consumer court inside a district administrative office, with a limited budget and few judges, is a joke,” said Maharjan. The top court had ordered the setting up of consumer courts in all 77 districts with separate infrastructure. In mid-June, the Industry Ministry's draft report on establishing a consumer court was submitted to the Law Ministry and sent to the Judicial Council for its suggestions.However, Ashok Kumar Chhetri, spokesperson for the Judicial Council, said he was unaware of the development.“The draft regarding the formation of consumer courts has not come to my notice.” The Consumer Protection Act, 2018, has a provision requiring the government to establish consumer courts. Based on this provision, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies submitted a draft of legislation to the Ministry of Law in September 2019. As the process dragged on, the Supreme Court, on February 20, 2022, ordered the government to establish consumer courts in all provinces to protect buyers' interests amid repeated instances of unfair market practices.A division bench of justices Bam Kumar Shrestha and Nahakul Subedi issued the order after the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights Nepal moved the court. Although the draft reached the Ministry of Law and then the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies, the process has been delayed due to frequent changes in government.According to an official update on the development, the Ministry of Industry cancelled the previous process last year and started afresh by forming a committee.The committee recommended setting up a pilot consumer court in a suitable location within the Kathmandu Valley, in coordination with or on the advice of the Judicial Council, considering the country's current condition and available resources, the official said. According to officials, more consumer courts will be gradually established in other districts based on financial resources.The Industry Ministry official said they realised that setting up just one consumer court per province would not be practical, as people would have to travel long distances for their cases. Therefore, the draft proposes gradually setting up consumer courts in all districts.A consumer court is a specialised court which primarily deals with consumer-related disputes, conflicts, and grievances. The court holds hearings to adjudicate these issues.The public has long been demanding a consumer court to bring unscrupulous traders under a legal framework within a fast-track system.Since consumers often hesitate to get involved in complex court cases, observers believe this has emboldened dishonest traders. They believe that once consumer courts are established, filing complaints will become easier, and the process will involve fewer hassles.

Concluding its two-day politburo meeting on Wednesday, the ruling party has decided against forging electoral alliances with other communist forces.During the meeting of the high-ranking decision-making body, some UML leaders had questioned the potential for unity with leftist parties like the CPN (Maoist Centre) in the upcoming elections. However, KP Sharma Oli, the party chairman and prime minister, dismissed the possibility, saying, “As the Nepali Congress has decided to contest the upcoming elections on its own, it is time for us to do the same and go to the elections independently.”The Nepali Congress and the UML have been archrivals in Nepali politics since the restoration of democracy in 1990. Despite this, they have also formed several governments together in the past, even while competing fiercely during elections and in leading the country.With the rise of new political forces and a strong rival like the Congress, some UML leaders had expressed concern that the party could face a serious threat in the upcoming elections. They suggested forging alliances with other communist parties or forming a “leftist” bloc ahead of the general and provincial elections scheduled for 2027.However, Chairman Oli dismissed the idea, saying, “There is no need to form such alliances, fronts, or unity among leftist parties. We don’t need such unity.”According to Rajendra Gautam, head of the party's publicity department, some leaders were curious about the possibility of a leftist alliance in the upcoming elections. However, Oli, citing the Nepali Congress’ decision to contest the elections solo, reiterated that unity among leftist parties is neither possible nor necessary, according to leaders.In 2017, the UML had forged an alliance with the Maoist Centre and contested the elections under the banner of a broader leftist unity. The alliance yielded strong results, securing a majority of seats, but it fell apart by mid-2021.According to a UML politburo member, there are several reasons behind the party’s decision not to pursue a similar alliance this time. “First, the UML is currently leading the incumbent government with the support of Nepali Congress. Second, there is a good trust between Oli and Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba. Since the two parties came together to form a government based on a seven-point agreement, it wouldn’t be a wise move to antagonise the Congress by forming alliance with other parties,” the member explained.“Third, the Congress’ decision to contest the elections independently prompted us to do the same. And fourth, the widening rift between the UML and the Maoist Centre in recent days also contributed to the decision to go it alone.”There are also strong voices within the UML that the party should not carry the burden of the Maoists into the upcoming elections, said the politburo member, adding, “We have already learned a lesson from our past decision to unite the party with the Maoists.In the politburo meeting, some leaders argued that the old model of left unity did not work. “So if an alliance with leftist parties is necessary, it should focus on unity with party cadres and supporters, rather than the leadership,” said Bishal Bhattarai, another member of the UML politburo.“We have a very painful history of failed unity among the left parties,” Bhattari added. “Therefore, we now have to opt for the new model where serious discussion and deliberation on ideology, organisation, and other critical issues would be discussed before forging any alliances.”He said the past unity between the UML and the Maoist Centre left a bad impression on the public. “Next time, if we consider leftist unity, we have to be careful, and engage in detailed discussions and deliberation,” said Bhattarai.The meeting also decided to give continuity to the partnership with the Nepali Congress and oppose any efforts at leftist unity. Also, the party has vowed to address growing issues of indiscipline and disorderly activities, so that the party could emerge as a strong national force in the 2027 elections.In his address, Oli had reviewed the current political situation, the government’s performance, and outlined future priorities. He urged the party members to work together to make the party’s Mission 2084 [2027 elections] a grand success. The UML has already launched several campaigns targeting the next elections. A total of 51 politburo members shared their suggestions and feedback during the meeting, where party general secretary Shanker Pokhrel presented a proposal to position the UML as a decisive national force. The meeting also provided several suggestions to improve the government’s functioning.

Speaking on Wednesday, the second day of the party’s politburo meeting that began Tuesday, leaders, without directly naming Shah, termed his statements unruly, while emphasising that the UML is a party with a long history. “Ours is the party with historical roots, therefore, we should not be concerned about statements from certain individuals,” leader Devi Gyawali told the Post, quoting politburo members. On Sunday Mayor Shah, known for his unconventional working style, once again criticised the prime minister, accusing him of failing to act on repeated calls of the metropolitan city to take action against Rekha Sharma. Sharma, a CPN-UML provincial assembly member in Lumbini, is accused of abusing a child domestic worker for eight years.The back-and-forth between Oli and Shah, a popular rapper, is nothing new. Prior to this, on June 3, Shah had accused Oli of ‘policy corruption’ related to the illegal land swap involving Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in Jhapa. Likewise, Gyawali said that most politburo members who spoke on Wednesday suggested the party contest the upcoming election on its own strength, without partnering with other parties. “For this, the party should strengthen its organisational base,” Gyawali quoted politburo members as saying at the meeting. There is no likelihood of a communist alliance in the upcoming election, the meeting asserted, according to Gyawali.Politburo members also discussed the crisis-ridden credit cooperatives and the ongoing parliamentary investigation led by UML politburo member Surya Thapa.“Our politburo members have expressed full confidence in the parliamentary special probe committee and the report it will submit to Parliament in the near future,” Bishal Bhattarai, a member of the politburo, told the Post. “The UML is committed to holding those responsible for the scam legally accountable.”However, none of the politburo members named names in connection with the cooperatives scam, Bhattarai added.On Monday, Kaski police had interrogated Rastriya Swatantra Party chief Rabi Lamichhane, who is also an immediate past deputy prime minister and home minister. Although the parliamentary special probe committee members claim that his involvement in the cooperatives scam cannot be ruled out, Lamichhane has consistently denied any role in the scam. After hearing from 51 politburo members on Wednesday, party chair Oli delivered his concluding remarks before closing the meeting.In his remarks, Oli said that the UML must address the growing indiscipline and unethical behaviours in the party, according to a politburo member. “One should either focus on politics or on enjoyment, but the two cannot go hand in hand,” the politburo member said, quoting Oli. “Immoral activities will not be tolerated.”During Wednesday’s session, politburo members also gave feedback on the party’s ‘Annual Action Plan For National Power Building’ report, which was presented by the party’s general secretary, Shankar Pokharel, on Tuesday.General Secretary Pokharel had presented an 18-point, 23-page report outlining the organisational work the party needs to undertake to be a decisive national power in the upcoming elections. The party’s annual plan includes renewing party memberships, managing and mobilising sister wings, conducting the party’s convention, expanding organisation, assigning responsibilities to district-level leaders who were defeated in the convention, and defining roles for new party members. As per the politburo member, the general secretary’s annual action plan report also calls for resolving the party’s internal conflicts. On Tuesday, Oli had announced that his party will contest the upcoming elections on its own strength. Oli said that the UML may cooperate with the Nepali Congress in government, but it will contest the upcoming elections on policy grounds.The UML chief said the party’s ‘Mission 84’ strategy aims to secure a single-party majority, and instructed party officials to prepare an annual action plan accordingly. “Even though we are currently partnering with the Congress, the UML will contest the elections independently and emerge as a major national power,” Oli said at the politburo meeting. On Sunday, the central committee meeting of the Nepali Congress, the largest party in Parliament, also considered contesting the next general and provincial elections independently. On Tuesday, UML chair and Prime Minister Oli also briefed members on the alleged attempts by the CPN (Maoist Centre) and its chair, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, to destabilise the government. “Since losing power, Dahal has been working to incite certain groups to create unrest,” a politburo party member quoted Oli as saying. “But we won’t let him succeed.”Oli further said that Dahal’s speech in the House of Representatives meeting on August 27 was intended at causing chaos. While speaking in the House, Dahal had warned that if the government pushed through its agenda on the pretext of majority rule, Nepal might see unrest similar to what happened in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.“It was not the language of a responsible leader,” Oli reportedly said during the politburo meeting.The politburo meeting has passed the ‘Annual Action Plan For National Power Building’ report presented by the general secretary, with suggestions. However, the final decision on it will be taken by the central secretariat, says Rajendra Gautam, the head of the UML publicity department.  ","summary":"Politburo members of the CPN-UML have criticised Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) Mayor Balendra Shah’s recent social media posts against party chair and prime minister KP Sharma Oli, calling them ‘unruly’.

The party, which got 29.28 percent of votes in the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008, could garner only 15.21 percent in the second Constituent Assembly of 2013. Even then, the party's downward journey did not stop. In the general election of 2017, the first after the country adopted the federal structure, the party was limited to 13.66 percent, which further declined during the November 2022 election to 11.13 percent.These data show that public support for the Maoist Centre is diminishing. But rather than acknowledging this fact and focusing on reinvigorating the party’s lost connection with the public, the party leaders often warn of street protests whenever they have some grudges with the leaders of the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML, the two major parties of the country.Political analysts say they do not see any point in leaders from the Maoist Centre and other parties harping on street protests.“In the present context, no political party has any moral ground to bring the common people to the street—maybe a few of their cadres might gather,” Krishna Khanal, a professor of political science, told the Post. “When it comes to the Maoist Centre, they were just unseated from power, so the party might be trying to reinvigorate its members in the name of street protest.”Khanal also says that the Maoist Centre has no moral ground to lead the mass protest. Referring to the latest election, Khanal adds that the Maoist Centre simply does not have enough public support for a large-scale protest. Likewise, CK Lal, another political analyst who is also a columnist for the Post, also does not see any chance for the Maoist Centre to lead any movement.“The Maoist Centre has been discredited because of what they did or didn’t do when they were in power, so I don’t see any chances that they will lead any kind of political movement as the kind that have happened in our South Asian neighbours,” Lal told the Post.However, Maoist Centre leaders have been citing Bangladesh and saying that election results do not matter when organising a mass protest.“Pressurising the government through the House and street is a declared policy of the party,” Dev Gurung, Maoist Centre general secretary, told the Post.On Sunday, the Maoist Centre issued a circular to the party's provincial committees, asking them to be ready for street protests against the government at any time.The circular, signed by party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and General Secretary Dev Gurung, instructs cadres to organise street protests if the government ignores the party’s warning at Parliament.“The party should strongly present its stance in Parliament regarding the regression, treason, protection of corrupt people, and the daily problems faced by the people, among other things,” the circular states. “If the government continues to protect the corrupt people and defend treason, despite our strong voice, we need to consider going to the street any time.”Party members are also instructed to oppose the KP Sharma Oli government “if it tries to obstruct the campaign of good governance that was started during the Dahal-led government.”“The intention to block the anti-corruption campaign and protect the corrupt is clear evidence [that the government is on a wrong path],” the directive said.Khanal, the political science professor, says that if the question of corruption can be raised to other political parties and leaders, the same can be done to Maoist Centre leaders and its chair, Dahal, who has been in power most of the time after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015.The Maoist Centre alleges that the Congress and UML have agreed to amend the constitution and are trying to drive the country towards the 1990 constitution.After the people's movement in 1990 against the 30-year Panchayat system, the country not only gained a democracy but also a constitution that valued constitutional monarchy.“The way the two parties are considering amending the constitution, there is a sign that the country will return to 1990 by reversing the achievements of the federal democratic republic, secular, proportional-inclusive,” the party circular disseminated in the seven provincial party committees claims.Despite being the third largest party (with 32 seats) in the House, Dahal, as the party's leader, became the prime minister for the first 18 months after the November 2022 election. He was unseated from power on July 12, when his chief coalition partner, UML, inked a seven-point agreement with Congress to form the government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli.When the Congress and the UML, the first and second largest parties (with 88 and 78 seats, respectively), inked a deal on July 1, they also agreed to amend the constitution, which is mentioned in the second point of the agreement as read out by Prime Minister Oli from the rostrum of Parliament on July 21 when he was seeking the vote of confidence.After being unseated from power, the Maoist Centre and its leaders have come down heavily on the two parties and their deal. However, the seven-point agreement is not the only reason they are skeptical of the government, experts say.After UML leaders began to accuse Maoist Centre leaders of electricity tariff corruption, they might have resorted to warnings of street protests, experts say. They add that there has been a heated debate recently between the lawmakers of UML and Maoists regarding how to acknowledge the 10-year insurgency, so that may be another reason Maoist Centre leaders are warning of street protest.Political analysts say parties and their leaders should stand for their political convictions based on ideology but it is not a feature of coalition politics.“In coalition politics, the opposition party warns the government of street protest,” Lal told the Post. “However, in reality, they tend not to be up to it.” ","summary":"During the two-day politburo meeting of CPN-UML, which started on Tuesday, party chair and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli briefed members on the alleged attempts by CPN (Maoist Centre) and its chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal to destabilise the government.“After being unseated from power, Dahal has been working to incite some groups to inflame the situation,” a politburo member of the party quoted Oli as saying. “But we won’t let him be successful.”Oli further said that Dahal’s speech in the House of Representatives meeting on August 27 was intended to create chaos.

After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” "},{"hash":"104b9b3a1799aebb554c297c6e332bd36867ec7edde26236fc688a8e415ee180","title":"lions-club-of-kathmandu-corporate-felicitates-various-personalities","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/valley/2024/08/04/lions-club-of-kathmandu-corporate-felicitates-various-personalities","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/photoforlionstory-1722787264.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1722729600000,"source":"kp","category":"valley","content":"The Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation.

He is elated.The arrival of the new large cardamom crop has beat farmers' expectations this year, yet yields have been lower, resulting in early seasonal price spikes.Traders say that the large cardamom market is experiencing a resurgence, driven by increasing international demand and seasonal consumption trends.The price had reached Rs2,150 per kg in January and dropped slightly.On Friday, the price of the spice reached Rs2,100 in Birtamod, the key market in eastern Tarai, where farmers sell their products.The rise in the price has made growers happy as Dashain, the country’s longest festival, approaches. This festival fuels strong domestic demand, and for farmers, the rise in crop prices means a happy celebration due to their income.From there, traders export large cardamom, one of the world's most expensive spices, to Siliguri, India.Nepal is the world's biggest producer of large cardamom, with a 68 percent global market share. The spice is grown in Sikkim, Darjeeling and Bhutan. Large cardamom was introduced in Ilam from Sikkim in 1865.The highest average price of large cardamom in Siliguri, India, on Thursday (August 29) was INR2,254 per kg or Rs2,660 per kg, as quoted at the Spices Board of India auction centre.Thapa, who came to Phungling Bazar, Taplejung, sold large cardamom to Bhadra Bir Regmi, president of the Large Cardamom Traders Association.“The first batch I had purchased was in July, at Rs2,000 per kg,” said Regmi. He said that the price around the festival time was Rs1,375 per kg.Large cardamom grown in Nepal, known as Alaichi, is one of Nepal's largest export crops.The large cardamom is harvested from mid-August to October.In Taplejung, the largest cardamom-producing district, the crop is cultivated in seven rural municipalities and one municipality, except Phaktalung rural municipality-7, Olangchung Gola.The cash crop is a major source of income in the district. Nepali large cardamom—also known as ‘black gold’ or ‘black cardamom’—belongs to the botanical family Zingiberaceae and is one of the most expensive spices in the world. According to a government report, it is an evergreen, perennial, and herbaceous plant grown on north-facing hill slopes.Balmani Baral, president of Large Cardamom Zone, Taplejung, said the traders had purchased the spice by keeping their cut, on top of the transportation cost.“As the demand soars, there’s a buzz in the market. Nowadays, traders offer the same rate in Taplejung that is offered in Birtamod, Jhapa,” he said. The surface travel distance between Taplejung and Jhapa is over 240 kilometres. “The prices, however, keep fluctuating,” Baral said. Large cardamom prices dropped to one of the lowest levels in Birtamode in December 2022, trading at 625 per kg, mainly due to the impact of Covid, when the supply chain was choked globally.In 2014, large cardamom hit an all-time high of Rs2,500 per kg.Since January, the large cardamom entrepreneurs association has projected that the price may breach the 2014 levels this year.Ninety-eight percent of the large cardamom produced in Nepal is exported to India. It is then reexported to Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Bahrain, among other countries.Pakistan is the largest importer of large cardamom, purchasing roughly 60 percent of India’s large cardamom exports. The local Muslim community uses large cardamom pods in biryani, a popular Pakistani dish, as a symbol of prosperity and wealth.As the government has not fixed the price and there is a minimum support price, large cardamom is sold by the farmers at the traders' rate.There is a huge price difference between the production's start and the harvest's end.Nirmal Bhattarai, president of the Large Cardamom Entrepreneurs' Association of Nepal, said they buy large cardamom from farmers at the rate quoted by the traders in Birtamod and after assessing the international market rate.Large cardamom is produced in 42 districts.According to the agriculture ministry's statistics, large cardamom is produced in 12,500 hectares. Koshi Province produces most of the country's large cardamom, as the commodity is harvested in 11,000 hectares in this province.The country produces 6,500 tonnes of large cardamom annually, 2,800 tonnes of which are produced in Taplejung district.Gulf countries have a huge potential market for Nepali cardamom, but there is no direct export to those countries. Traders are unwilling to take risk exporting to those countries, as the Indian market is assured for them.According to the Trade and Export Promotion Centre, cardamom export declined by 4.06 percent to Rs7.94 billion in the last fiscal year ended mid-July. Large cardamom produced in Nepal is organic and provides income to mostly low-income rural families.Large cardamom exports rose 127 percent in the past ten years.

They, too, have families and will be stressed and burnt out if they are forced to work continuously.” "},{"hash":"bd2df4227ddba14e60e8ae88cf36b0b3318fdf4cfd629328df08d0dc34aef848","title":"over-3-500-infected-with-scrub-typhus-since-mid-july","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/health/2024/08/27/over-3-500-infected-with-scrub-typhus-since-mid-july","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/thumb-1724717569.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1724716800000,"source":"kp","category":"health","content":"Over 3,500 people across the country have been infected with scrub typhus since mid-July, the start of this fiscal year.Officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division say they expect more cases in the coming days as the disease typically peaks in September.“Like in previous years, hundreds of people have also been infected with scrub typhus this year,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of vector Control Section at the division. “More people can get infected in the coming days, as the peak season is still ahead.”Scrub typhus, or bush typhus, is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Orientia tsutsugamushi, a mite-borne bacterium. It spreads in humans when bitten by infected chiggers (larval mites) found in mice.Until a few years ago, it was believed that people residing in rural areas or those working in grasslands or fields were at high risk. However, urban populations are also now being affected by the disease.“Over 100 people from Hetauda Sub-metropolitan city have been infected from Scrub typhus this year,” said Krishna Bahadur Major, chief of the Health Office, Makawanpur. “Although more cases are reported in villages, urban areas are not immune, with several positive cases emerging there as well.”Doctors point out high fever, headache, abdominal pain, backache, joint and muscle pain, red rash, nausea and vomiting as some of the symptoms of scrub typhus infection. Patients with severe illness may develop bleeding which could lead to organ failure. The infection can lead to respiratory distress, inflation of brain, lungs, kidney failure and then multi-organ failure. If not treated immediately, it could be fatal.Nepal saw a surge in scrub typhus cases after the calamitous 2015 earthquakes that killed nearly 9,000 persons across the country.Three months after the quakes, the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, alerted the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division about six children with unusual fevers and severe respiratory problems.Serum samples were collected for subsequent tests in Kathmandu and Bangkok, which confirmed a scrub typhus outbreak. By then, four children had already died in the course of the treatment. By the end of the year, 101 cases were confirmed in 16 districts, and four more people succumbed to the disease.The magnitude of the outbreak escalated in 2016 when 831 cases of scrub typhus were reported in 47 districts, and 14 people died by the end of that year.According to the Ministry of Health and Population data, more than 1,026 people were infected with the disease in 2020. Their number increased to 1,999 in 2021, and it rose to more than 2,900 in 2022.In 2023, over 5,000 people were infected with the deadly disease. Doctors say the risk of severity and fatality can be minimised if the patients are diagnosed and treated early, they say.Ordinary antibiotics, such as doxycycline and azithromycin, which are on the essential drugs list supplied by the government to health facilities across the country for free distribution, can cure the disease.However, what is concerning is that many health workers, including doctors, lack sufficient knowledge about diagnosing scrub typhus. Many health facilities also lack reagents to carry out tests for the disease.Doctors can diagnose the disease based on the symptoms, but the risk of misdiagnosis is high, as scrub typhus symptoms are similar to those of other illnesses. They warn that waiting for lab results before starting treatment could be dangerous. It can take about a week to get lab results, and by that time, if the patient is not treated can fall into a coma and suffer multi-organ failure.

Patients’ visitors have to hold the IV bags or we have to improvise by tying them to windows.”This situation is becoming increasingly common in hospitals in many districts, which are seeing a spike in patient numbers amid a massive dengue outbreak. The virus has spread to 75 of the country’s 77 districts, killing at least three people and infecting 5,119 others since January. Two mountain districts—Humla and Mustang—have yet to record dengue cases this year. “For the last three years, we have witnessed a dengue epidemic during the monsoon season,” said Jayaru. “We can only request our staff to serve extra hours, but cannot provide equipment or expand bed numbers.”Doctors say most patients do not want to be referred to other places, as reaching Dharan, the nearest city, in an ambulance takes over six hours. Holding seriously ill patients in ill-equipped hospitals is risky as they lack consultant doctors, blood transfusion services, and high-tech laboratories, among other things.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed by the influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks, both vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and spiking patient flow.”Of the 5,119 cases of the dengue cases reported, only 77 cases are from Madhesh Province, which is traditionally an endemic area. Health Ministry officials admit that the disease is shifting towards hills and mountain regions due to climate change. They say other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, are also contributing to the spread of the disease to new areas. “Yes, new challenges have increased in areas previously considered less risky, but we have not strengthened our health facilities to deal with the emerging challenges accordingly,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Our health system is not is not designed to address these evolving risks.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organization, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.In 2023, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus across the country.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.Back in 2019, dengue killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal over the past few years with cases consistently rising each year.Epidemiologists as well as virologists now consider the dengue virus as a major public health problem in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of persons getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities have not taken the situation seriously. The lackadaisical approach, they believe, is contributing to the spread of the virus. They call for implementing measures such as search-and-destroy drives and awareness campaigns to control dengue vectors.A report by the United Nations titled “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for the dengue-carrying mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death.

The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 report, stunting decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.Even though the health survey report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces. More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Likewise, around 10 percent of children under the age of five years in Madhesh Province have been found suffering from wasting.Officials said the new study was required to determine the latest progress on the population's nutrition conditions.“The nutrition status of the adolescent population will be monitored by schools, while health facilities will monitor children, pregnant women, and new mothers,” said Thapa. “Health workers will also take classes in schools to educate students about the importance of good nutrition and counsel pregnant women and new mothers at health facilities.”Along with the lack of sufficient nutrient foods, poor sanitation and lack of safe drinking water and treatment are blamed for wasting.Doctors say malnutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of complications and maternal and neonatal deaths, as well as the likelihood of low birth weight. It is a major impediment to growth, affecting human capital and economic productivity of a country.Experts say nutrition is directly linked to the country's overall development. Malnutrition affects children's physical and mental growth, which ultimately affects the country’s economic health.It weakens intellectual capacity, limits productivity in adulthood, and increases vulnerability to certain diseases.Nutritionists ask authorities to promote locally available foods, educate people about the importance of a nutritious diet, and provide fortified flour to improve nutritional conditions and reduce dependency on freely distributed foods.Nepal also has an international obligation to improve the condition of malnourished children.To meet the SDG targets, the country needs to reduce stunting to 15 percent from the current 32 percent by 2030, wasting to four percent from the current eight percent, underweight condition to 10 percent from the existing 19 percent, and anaemia to 10 percent from more than 43 percent at present.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals, (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. ","summary":"I can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. ","summary":"“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value?

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood.

2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. ","summary":"In 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added.

She was first reported missing on August 2 when police visited her home in Manassas city, where she lived with her husband, Naresh Bhatt and her year-old daughter. What seemed like an act of disappearance seemingly turned into a convoluted case of murder when the husband, a former Fairfax County police recruit and ex-US Army Reserve, was accused of killing her after the detectives searched their home on August 21. Nepalis who knew Mamta and her well-wishers from the community were in shock. If the accusations are true, this would be another sad and shameful case of the killing of a Nepali woman by her partner after being subjected to Intimate Partner Violence (IPV). It forces us to reflect on the hidden problem of violence against women in intimate relationships in Nepal. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), IPV is a common form of violence against women and includes physical, sexual and emotional abuse and controlling behaviours by an intimate partner. The National Demographic Health Survey 2022 revealed that 27 percent of women in Nepal had experienced IPV in their lifetime. Further, the registered cases of domestic violence in Nepal have noticeably increased in the past 28 years.Many Nepali women feel unseen, unheard and powerless in their relationship with men. Moreover, there is a general lack of understanding of consent among Nepali men. During the Covid-19 pandemic, violence between intimate partners increased worldwide. In Nepal, police reported that cases of violence against women steadily rose despite the country being under prohibitory orders. The ingrained patriarchy manifests in various forms in intimate relationships where women suffer and become scarred for life. Marital rape is also widespread, with loopholes in the implementation of related laws.Internalising the lack of safety at home, many Nepali women dream of going abroad and settling there. But, sadly, patriarchy leading to IPV goes beyond borders. This year alone, there have been cases of Nepali women being killed abroad. On August 29, Muna Pandey, a Nepali student, was shot dead in her apartment in Houston, Texas. Police arrested 51-year-old Bobby Singh, who was known to frequent the restaurant where Pandey worked. Earlier this year, Chandra Maya Poudel-Rimal was murdered by her husband, James Rimal, in Ohio during an argument. In the same state, in July, Tika Dhimal was murdered by her husband, Sada Dhimal, who later committed suicide.These instances suggest Nepali women are vulnerable to IPV everywhere. In many cases, women give their partners several chances before speaking up. Even if they decide to seek legal help, they usually settle the matter, facing pressure from family or their partners. A former colleague reportedly knew of Mamta’s domestic violence situation with her husband. When her colleague told Mamta to leave her house and offered help, Mamta decided to give her husband another chance. Although Nepal has made progress through stronger laws against the violation of women’s rights and participation in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, they are still not enough to ensure women’s safety from IPV. There is an urgent need to foster awareness to empower women to seek help and assert their rights. Finally, we must teach our men the basics of consent in relationships.

It was a clear reminder that passage of the transitional law alone is not enough to put the violent past to rest.The guns in a decade-long war fell silent with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006, which stated that “both sides [the Government of Nepal and Maoists] shall assist each other to mark landmines and booby-traps used during the time of armed conflict by providing necessary information within 30 days and defuse and excavate them within 60 days.” Yet, nearly two decades later, the randomly left weapons from the conflict period continue to endanger people. The Panchthar case is one of several examples. In its recent editorial, Kantipur, the Post’s sister publication, highlighted six such incidents of explosions following the CPA’s signing. To take just two examples, in the explosion on April 30, 2020, two children had perished, while on October 29, 2022, four children had died. The Maoist insurgency had a multifaceted impact on people’s lives. Many civilians who suffered injuries, who were displaced and who lost their loved ones still await justice. Many of them are obliged to live in poverty, and they still struggle with the war’s trauma. The Act, amended to heed their concerns, will go some way towards bringing them a sense of closure. Yet even the amended Act has loopholes. Even though the new bill addresses incidents of post-war explosions and promises relief to the victims, it is silent on locating and destroying all the remaining explosives from the conflict period. Such random explosions and death of civilians will also puncture the picture of Nepal’s successful peace process that the country rightly takes great pride in. It is time for the government to carry out its legal obligations, honour the promises made in the CPA, and ensure that there is no more risk to public life from stray bombs and booby traps. To start with, there must be comprehensive mapping of all the war-time weapons, and the ex-Maoist leaders as well as the security forces should join hands to solve this lingering problem. Also, on a more philosophical note, even if the peace process is successfully concluded, the stray bombs are also a reminder that you can never fully recover from a bloody civil war. This is all the more reason to try to eschew violent means to get to political ends. Yes, Nepal is still beset with a legion of problems but violence, in the long run, only makes them worse.  ","summary":"President Ramchandra Paudel’s approval on August 29, 2024, of the bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act was widely welcomed.

Palesha Goverdhan clinched Nepal’s maiden Olympics-level medal in Paris early on Saturday, sending ripples of excitement and hope across her homeland. Goverdhan seemed destined for success given her stellar track record in international meets over the past few years. Four years ago, Goverdhan, who entered the Tokyo Paralympic Games on a wildcard, had also qualified for the bronze medal final but had lost the bout. Two years later, at the Asian Para Games 2022 in Hangzhou, China, Goverdhan won a medal. She then became the first Nepali paralympian to qualify for the Paralympic Games. And now the 21-year-old has delivered on the biggest stage. After Goverdhan’s victory, her coach Kabi Raj Negi Lama rightly said that his charge had shattered the assumption that a Nepali could never win an Olympic medal. Yet it had appeared that way only a fortnight ago when none of the seven Nepali athletes who took part in the Paris Summer Olympics could create much of an impact. The usual suspects were blamed for their failure: Nepal’s poor sporting infrastructures, paucity of high-level practice, lack of professionalism, etc. Nepal, it seemed, would have to wait for a long time for Olympics success. That was until Goverdhan bagged the taekwondo bronze at the Paris Paralympics. This sends a vital message to other Nepali athletes as well as the Nepali state. One, as coach Lama hinted, Goverdhan’s medal breaks down the psychological barrier that a Nepali cannot succeed at the highest level. There is no inherent reason Nepali athletes or para-athletes cannot make their mark if they get the right kind of state support. Concomitantly, the message that a woman with a disability can capture her country’s attention and bring it international fame is no less important in what is still a patriarchal society. Nepali female athletes are world class, as the country’s women football and cricket teams have repeatedly shown. With a little more impetus, the sky’s the limit of what they can achieve. Goverdhan’s success is also an example of long-term thinking. After her failure to win a medal in Tokyo, Goverdhan pushed herself hard in the following years, and much of the time after that was spent preparing for the next Parlalympics. This suggests that Nepal would do well to start investing for success at Los Angeles 2028 right now as a part of the country’s long term sporting vision. There have of late been some positive gestures from the Nepali state. For instance, this year’s policies and programmes promises fellowships to 1,000 talented youths in various fields, including in sports. There will be special focus on cultivating women athletes. Similarly, various incentives and allowances have also been declared for the Nepali sports stars who achieve international success. There is also a new emphasis on building new stadiums and upgrading existing ones. If all these schemes materialise, greater international sporting success for Nepal will be guaranteed. This is crucial. Nepali youths are desperate for home-grown international idols, whose success inspires and is worthy of emulation. If they see their peers compete and even win against the best in the world, their ambitions will soar. This in turn will boost the morale of their country.

Political parties displayed exemplary unity in the course of endorsing the bill, which was promptly welcomed by the international community. If this undertaking succeeds, the remaining tasks of Nepal’s nearly two-decade-long peace process will be completed. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert and former lawmaker Radheshyam Adhikari of Nepali Congress, who has over the years been closely involved in Nepal’s transitional justice process.As a legal expert, how do you see the latest amendment in the transitional justice Act?Looking at it from a legal perspective, the Supreme Court’s order given in this context is the major basis. The amendment has complied with over 95 percent of the top court’s directives. There is one more context we can refer to. The government in 2018 had prepared a ‘zero draft’ on this issue. The international community had expressed their reservations on certain provisions. Most of the contents of that draft have been retained while addressing those reservations. There are some major improvements. The amendment has taken a more liberal approach to victims’ rights. For instance, the draft had only said that the victims would be consulted for reconciliation but the latest amendment made victims’ consent mandatory. If a victim doesn’t want to give consent, he or she can go to court. This is a major change. Likewise, the draft had said the verdict of the to-be-formed Special Court [with a mandate to hear and decide the transitional justice related cases] would be final. But the amendment has allowed the dissatisfied side to appeal in the Supreme Court. There is a plan for a separate fund to carry out transitional justice related tasks so as to ensure fiscal autonomy for the two transitional justice commissions. This process needs fiscal as well as administrative autonomy. You just mentioned that the new Act has complied with 95 percent of the top court’s directives. Could you elaborate on the remaining five percent?I meant to say that the amendment is closer to the court’s directives. I can’t say it is 100 percent because even they [the Supreme Court justices] at the time said ‘so and so’ should be done on a hypothetical ground as so many things were still evolving. Now, some issues might have become redundant. But most of the things have been addressed. See, first, we should have conceptual clarity. There is a fundamental difference between retributive justice and transitional justice systems. In retributive justice, cases are decided by regular courts based on existing laws while in the transitional justice system we have to look into political, social as well as cultural aspects. This is the internationally accepted approach.The amendment has included a provision of up to 75 percent reduced sentencing. The attorney general, who works for the government, is mandated to recommend this. Isn’t this akin to directing the court? Wouldn’t it instead be prudent to leave that to the court? If that were not done, there would be mistrust and the process may not have gotten sufficient support from the warring sides of the past. In such a scenario, the process may have again failed. A supportive role of the stakeholders will be crucial. Of late, I often urge the victims to cooperate with the process; otherwise it will remain a never-ending process. It’s already too late. So, now we should be pragmatic. We should carry out things on a priority basis. Finding and respecting truth are the first and second priorities. The option to go to court is there, if someone wants so. The fourth priority is reparation. The goal is to establish that no one will need to take up arms and resort to violence in Nepal again. Now, most of the stakeholders are positive about concluding this process. The international community has in fact asked us what type of support we need.It is said the role of Desmond Tutu, who led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, was crucial for the success of the country’s transitional justice process. Do you think the personality of the heads of the commissions will be vital in our case as well?Leadership definitely matters. In Colombia as well, a person of similar stature, who is respected by all sides in the country, led the process. So, the leadership and composition of the commissions will matter. The commissions should be allowed to work and make decisions on their own.There are nearly 64,000 complaints with the TRC and around 2,400 with the CIEDP. How should the commissions carry out their task? Will they deal with each and every case individually? What are international practices and what is a broader conceptual understanding in our case?It is too early to talk about the working modality but I believe most cases should be dealt with in a representative way. But cases of serious rights violations will enter the prosecution stage. Producing sufficient evidence to prove the crimes, however, will be challenging. For instance, some rape victims may not be able to name the perpetrators. They were raped but couldn’t even recognise the perpetrator. In such a case, the state should respect such victims and provide reparation to them. Some complainants may choose not to continue with the cases. Before determining whether certain cases are serious or not, each file has to be checked at least once. So, the commissions need a large number of investigating officers. Field offices need to be set up based on the number and nature of complaints. What kind of involvement of international agencies may be needed for this process?It will certainly need the involvement of international agencies. Nepal’s peace process is basically home-grown but we will also seek support and expertise from international agencies, as we did in the past. We never work in isolation but the areas where we need their support will be decided only after the commissions start their work. We need international experts for certain specialised tasks, such as conducting DNA tests and exhuming bodies buried during the insurgency. The way the international community promptly welcomed the new amendment, it seems that the government and political parties were working in close consultation with them. Is that so?As far as I am informed, everything was done by Nepalis. But there was communication with the international agencies. They had earlier expressed their concerns on the ‘zero draft’ and the issues have been addressed. Therefore, they promptly welcomed it. They obviously are involved indirectly because it is a matter the international community is closely watching. But now we may need their direct support to carry out certain specialised tasks.Why didn’t the amendment even mention the use of child soldiers, crime against humanity and war crime?It is a matter of serious consideration as to whether our cases fall under the definition of serious crimes such as crime against humanity. The commissions will study this aspect as well.Don’t you think the provision of reduced sentencing and overlooking of certain legal aspects may promote impunity?Even now, inmates get a waiver of around 50 percent under the regular legal system. So the provision to reduce sentences is already there.But such sentences are reduced only after serving for a certain time and demonstrating good behaviour. Shouldn’t we have adopted a similar approach in this case?Transitional justice system should be seen a bit differently. Here, I give you an example. In Colombia, the TRC of the country summoned the seven secretariat members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). They were first briefed about the charges registered against them. They admitted that they committed the crimes. Then, all of them were acquitted because they spoke the truth. The TRC in Colombia gave priority to finding the truth. If someone showed honesty and cooperated in finding the truth they wouldn’t be punished. But they increased the penalty for those who tried to mislead them through falsehood.Can we say our process is a bit driven by a reparative approach?I again stress that we should look at the transitional justice process differently than how we look at the retributive justice system. It needs a different law, different court and a different jurisprudence.It takes years of rigorous work to complete this process and firm commitment of major political forces is vital. Frequent changes in coalition and unpredictable relations between the political forces is our reality. Don’t you think such instability may hamper this process?This time around, the role of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is very positive. Chiefs of the three biggest parties, while addressing a parliament meeting, have expressed their commitment to make this process successful. Their unity on this matter is important. Not only them, all the political parties represented in the federal parliament, except one lawmaker from a fringe party, have supported this amendment. It has thus become a national issue. I hope this consensus will remain intact while picking officials for the commissions and taking the entire process to a logical end.Given your expertise and involvement in this process, you are being seen as a strong candidate for the TRC chair. What is the reality?I have nothing to say as no one has talked to me about this.

Thousands of people lose their lives in road crashes every year across the country. What are the factors causing these disasters? Why have the authorities failed to prevent them? The Post's Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former secretary Arjun Jung Thapa, who was director general at the Department of Roads for years, to discuss the pressing issue.Why are road accidents taking place so frequently in Nepal? There is no one reason for road accidents. On the infrastructure front, factors like design, condition and geometry of a road are crucial. Putting sign boards along the roads and giving vital information about the particular location is necessary. Those signs should be placed properly so all driving vehicles and passengers can see them clearly. Some technical aspects, such as whether the superelevation is properly designed, particularly at sharp bends, matter greatly. These must be regularly monitored and corrected in time. Regular vehicle fitness tests are essential. Experienced and disciplined drivers are equally important to ensure road safety. Some accidents occur when drivers are unfamiliar with the roads. For instance, the accident that took place at Anbukhaireni of Tanahun district on Friday, killing 27 Indian nationals, might have been because of the driver’s lack of familiarity with the road condition. Yet another serious concern is the lack of road discipline. Those who come to Nepal with years-long experience of driving abroad fear driving because of motorists' reckless driving and lack of lane discipline. The recent accident at Jadibuti, killing one scooter rider, could have been avoided if proper lane discipline had been followed. Reckless driving by motorcyclists has remained a big problem in our case. So, a separate lane should be designated for bikers. Similarly, lanes should be designated for vehicles based on their speed. But such rules are never followed seriously in our case. Traffic police have been entrusted with enforcing traffic rules but lack the human resources to enforce them effectively. We need an integrated and centrally controlled digital traffic light management system. We had experimented with a system as a trial for some time after 2015. We called a bid but couldn’t accept anyone as the bidders proposed more than the rate we had fixed. The project collapsed, and that system could never be revived. We badly lack technology in this sector. When we try to import technology, brokers get involved and ruin the entire process. The condition of roads built haphazardly, mainly in the hills, is another major concern. What do you say about that?We have built around 80,000 kilometres of road across the country. Of that, only around 14,000 kilometres fall under the jurisdiction of the road department. The rest of the road sections fall under the jurisdiction of various authorities, such as the Department of Local Infrastructure and provincial and local governments. The busiest roads are those under the Department of Roads. They are highways and regional roads. Only 50 percent of the roads overseen by the Department of Roads are blacktopped and are not maintained properly. Of the remaining 65,000 kilometres of road, only 4,000 kilometres are blacktopped. This means that the road condition across the country is poor and must be upgraded. The government will now develop the Kakarvitta-Gorusinghe section of the East-West Highway as a safe demonstration corridor. There will be proper infrastructure for crossings, grade-separated intersections, controlled entries, fencing for the safety from wild animals and crossings for wildlife. Local vehicles will run on service lanes. If it is developed as planned, it would be on par with Asian standards. Other roads in the pipeline will follow these standards. These criteria are being implemented while upgrading the Nagdhunga-Mugling road section as well. We have miles to go to upgrade our roads to international standards. Why are we failing to make quality roads?We can’t build our roads according to the original design. At times, locals obstruct road construction and force us to change the alignments. Then, we have to build them based on the availability of the land.Are our rural roads fit from the engineering perspective?Around 35,000 kilometers out of the 65,000 kilometers of roads that don’t fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Roads are built randomly. Local leaders, influential individuals, and bulldozer operators fix the alignments of such roads.How can we rectify the malpractices in this sector?We need to activate the National Road Safety Council urgently. Officials from all the concerned departments and representatives from various stakeholders should sit together in this body and find solutions. Also, coordination has become more complicated in the federal system. For instance, highways are under federal jurisdiction, transport management on highways falls under provincial authority, while road management is under federal jurisdiction. Therefore, an effective coordinating body has become a must. Otherwise, we can’t control the increasing trend of deaths in road accidents. At least 1,700 people lost their lives in 2013, and the then government set a target to reduce it by at least 50 percent by 2020. Instead, the yearly death toll has crossed 2,800 now.While it takes years to complete road upgrading tasks, construction materials are left unmanaged and scattered, making driving along the road very difficult and dangerous. Can’t such things be improved?Contractors are powerful because of their political connection with influential leaders including prime ministers and ministers. Civil servants can’t be assertive when the contractors get political protection. At times, they try to use force to coerce government officials. If the situation is not going in their favour, they provoke locals with a plan to get extension in their contract citing local unrest. Experts say that the government is also to blame as it doesn’t carry out development projects properly. Do you agree?I worked for three decades in government agencies until a few months ago. What I found is that one government devises specific policies, plans and initiates certain projects but successive governments stop them. The new leadership starts its own plans and projects. Then, the contractors don’t get their payment. This is the other side of the story. Another problem is that our ministers, lawmakers and leaders show interest in the projects that deserve the least priority while important projects don’t get attention. For instance, around 30 kilometers of Arniko Highway, which connects Nepal with China, has been badly damaged. This is a very important road for the country. Can’t the government repair and maintain a 30-kilometer section of a highway? It requires just around Rs3 billion whereas leaders have allocated over Rs11.5 billion in the projects of personal interests of leaders. Around Rs4 billion has been allocated under lawmakers’ constituency development programmes and additional Rs5 billion has been earmarked for local bridges. We have allocated around Rs60 billion for non-important projects but we have ignored a crucial road, Arniko Highway, which was built with the support of our neighbour China in the 1960s. Thus we have given unnecessary importance where it doesn’t deserve while ignoring vital development projects. The road accidents are directly or indirectly linked to the government’s wrong policies and plans.Development projects are sometimes said to have failed due to rivalry between some leaders. Do you have any such experience?I will give you an example. In the Biratnagar-Bathnaha cross-border rail project, we had to build over 13 kilometers of the railway. It was around four to five years ago. We cleared over 11 kilometers but locals protested in the remaining section where a station was planned. The locals obstructed work there even as 85 percent of the money for land acquisition had already been distributed. Later, we found that the then minister Aman Lal Modi had provoked the locals to demand for additional money. He demanded a ‘special rate for his men’. But the laws don’t allow it.Some experts argue that to upgrade the quality of our roads, we need to make this sector competitive and, for that, we have to allow the private sector to develop projects. Is it viable?The government is hindering the private sector from entering into this business. They don’t invest without assured returns. They need roads like Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway. The government called for proposals in the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model for this project. They were interested. But the government simultaneously allowed a company to build the Kathmandu-Tunnel Road in the same area. Then the investors felt a risk to invest there. But, the company couldn’t continue the tunnel project. Private sector should be welcomed in this sector but we should create a conducive environment for that. Bangladesh and India have built infrastructure projects under the BOT model. We can do it as well.What do you think about the jurisdictional dispute over the New Road stretch between the Kathmandu Metropolis and the Department of Roads? Who should maintain this road?All the roads within the metropolis fall under the local government’s jurisdiction, as the constitution clearly states. The federal department is managing the roads with the understanding that the local governments are not efficient at maintaining them for now. If a local unit wants to maintain a certain road section on its own, the department should allow it without any dispute. Both sides showed childish behaviour while handling the New Road case. ","summary":"Lately, road accidents are taking place almost every day. Thousands of people lose their lives in road crashes every year across the country. What are the factors causing these disasters? Why have the authorities failed to prevent them? The Post's Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former secretary Arjun Jung Thapa, who was director general at the Department of Roads for years, to discuss the pressing issue.Why are road accidents taking place so frequently in Nepal? There is no one reason for road accidents. On the infrastructure front, factors like design, condition and geometry of a road are crucial. Putting sign boards along the roads and giving vital information about the particular location is necessary. Those signs should be placed properly so all driving vehicles and passengers can see them clearly. Some technical aspects, such as whether the superelevation is properly designed, particularly at sharp bends, matter greatly. These must be regularly monitored and corrected in time. Regular vehicle fitness tests are essential. Experienced and disciplined drivers are equally important to ensure road safety. Some accidents occur when drivers are unfamiliar with the roads. For instance, the accident that took place at Anbukhaireni of Tanahun district on Friday, killing 27 Indian nationals, might have been because of the driver’s lack of familiarity with the road condition. Yet another serious concern is the lack of road discipline. Those who come to Nepal with years-long experience of driving abroad fear driving because of motorists' reckless driving and lack of lane discipline. The recent accident at Jadibuti, killing one scooter rider, could have been avoided if proper lane discipline had been followed. Reckless driving by motorcyclists has remained a big problem in our case. So, a separate lane should be designated for bikers. Similarly, lanes should be designated for vehicles based on their speed. But such rules are never followed seriously in our case. Traffic police have been entrusted with enforcing traffic rules but lack the human resources to enforce them effectively. We need an integrated and centrally controlled digital traffic light management system. We had experimented with a system as a trial for some time after 2015. We called a bid but couldn’t accept anyone as the bidders proposed more than the rate we had fixed. The project collapsed, and that system could never be revived. We badly lack technology in this sector. When we try to import technology, brokers get involved and ruin the entire process. The condition of roads built haphazardly, mainly in the hills, is another major concern. What do you say about that?We have built around 80,000 kilometres of road across the country. Of that, only around 14,000 kilometres fall under the jurisdiction of the road department. The rest of the road sections fall under the jurisdiction of various authorities, such as the Department of Local Infrastructure and provincial and local governments. The busiest roads are those under the Department of Roads. They are highways and regional roads. Only 50 percent of the roads overseen by the Department of Roads are blacktopped and are not maintained properly. Of the remaining 65,000 kilometres of road, only 4,000 kilometres are blacktopped. This means that the road condition across the country is poor and must be upgraded. The government will now develop the Kakarvitta-Gorusinghe section of the East-West Highway as a safe demonstration corridor. There will be proper infrastructure for crossings, grade-separated intersections, controlled entries, fencing for the safety from wild animals and crossings for wildlife. Local vehicles will run on service lanes. If it is developed as planned, it would be on par with Asian standards. Other roads in the pipeline will follow these standards.

Three years on, she is now the most vocal leader calling for a unification of the two parties. Why didn’t the new party perform well, and what made her lobby for a party merger? Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat with former minister Jhakri for more insights.You worked actively to form the CPN (Unified Socialist), but the party couldn’t perform well. It couldn’t even become a national party from the general elections. What went wrong?We formed the CPN (Unified Socialist) out of compulsion. When Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli—who was prime minister at the time as well—dissolved the House of Representatives in December 2020, we firmly stood against his move, saying that it sowed the seeds of political instability. We staged huge protests and moved the Supreme Court against the decision of Oli, our party chair at the time. I was among the petitioners. Once the top court reinstated the House, we expected the party to move smoothly. Unfortunately, that couldn’t happen. The party establishment led by Oli and the rival faction took extreme actions against each other. The agitating faction announced action against the party chair, and the party establishment expelled us from the party itself. When Oli dissolved the House a second time, we protested the move as it brought instability. We were in favour of transforming the party through intra-party struggle, but the situation took some unexpected turns. We didn’t quit the party with a lofty plan of making a new revolutionary organisation. We were compelled to do so.Our new party accommodated many genuine leaders who had been sidelined in the UML. But ultimately, old leaders heavily dominated the new party’s central committee. They were active leaders of their time but were out of touch with the new, changing context. Young leaders didn’t get space in party committees. I proposed recruiting at least 40 percent members under 40 years in the central committee and over 50 percent members under 30 years in the district committees. I made a 29-year-old leader the chair of the district committee in my home district. In 42 days, I attended 36 district conventions where youths in their 30s were elected district committee chairs. I tried to reach out to municipalities to promote youths in the party chapters. But at the central level, old faces dominated party committees. That didn’t attract people to the party or impress the general public. Thus, it failed to gather steam right from the beginning.Many think that Madhav Kumar Nepal’s selection as party chief was a wrong move since he had led the UML for 15 years and become prime minister, and people didn’t find novelty in the new party. Do you think so too?Madhav Kumar Nepal has been the most active leader in the party since its inception. Whatever the party has achieved so far is because of him. But a party leader must mobilise teams with defined roles and responsibilities and continuously motivate and engage them in result-oriented tasks. He works a lot but doesn’t mobilise teams effectively. Observers say the Unified Socialist was formed due to the personality clash between top leaders and that it lacked a national agenda and a clear policy to prove the need for a new party. Do you feel so?Our immediate agenda was safeguarding the constitution and ensuring political stability in the country. We protested the House dissolution guided by the same policy. But when provincial governments were made like satellites of the federal government, we couldn’t play any role in stabilising them.The UML is guided by the policy of People’s Multiparty Democracy, propounded by the late Madan Bhandari. There was a debate on further enhancing the policy in the changed context. A large section of Left intellectuals were interested in contributing to that. We could have engaged them in the process. But our party stopped the debate on that topic as well. We missed the chance of engaging many critical individuals in the discourse and having a relatively different policy. When in the UML, we practised direct elections of party representatives and leaders from the conventions. Unfortunately, leaders of the new party, Unified Socialist, made a statute that gave powers to the party leadership to nominate party secretariat, office bearers and other members. Leaders would pick those who are loyal to them. This regressive approach killed competition in the party.You are known to prefer a more proactive work and decision-making approach. There are rumours that you have been fed up with the party’s lacklustre style and are mulling to join the mother party, UML.If I were to decide only from a personal perspective, I would have done so much earlier because I had multiple opportunities in the past. But I am for party merger because I don’t see any relevance of running multiple retail shops under communist banners because we are not substantially different from each other in terms of policies. Our electoral system has also made it necessary. The Unified Socialist can’t run like this. We must accept reality and decide—merging our party with the UML is better than running it this way. But it seems that the top leaders of the twin parties are still bitter about each other.True, the bitterness lingers on, mainly among the top leaders. We have also made some mistakes. The UML offered some opportunities to the Unified Socialist, and we should have made some offers to capitalise on the favourable situation. At one time, UML leaders proposed our party chair as a candidate for the vacant post of the country’s President. We should have devised our own proposal and made a win-win deal. But we ran away and squandered the opportunity. If Madhav Kumar Nepal had become president on the UML’s proposal, our party might have been reunited with the UML much earlier. I also took an initiative to that end but in vain. Later also, UML chair Oli visited our party chair’s residence to have our party on board the government. But the reaction from our side ruined things. We are certainly not responding to the UML responsibly. Rather than irritate the UML, we must turn each positive gesture into an opportunity for party unity.One more factor is blocking the unity between the two parties. There are a large number of second-rung leaders in the UML who can’t directly confront Oli. They are now encouraging former President Bidya Devi Bhandari to join active politics and trying to make decisions in their favour through her. Oli knows these leaders will support Nepal when he returns to the UML. Why would he [Oli] then merge the fringe party and create another power centre against himself? He knows Madhav Kumar Nepal will challenge him with the backing of the dissidents. It is natural for a leader to think twice before allowing another leader of your stature to create a parallel power centre within the organisation. Even I would have thought twice. This is a major factor hindering party unity.Your party chair and other key leaders seem quite close to CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and critical of UML chair Oli. Moreover, Oli often lambasts Madhav Kumar Nepal publicly. Will they still merge the parties?In principle, our party is open for unity with any Left party. But party cadres won’t join the Maoist Centre. If our leadership decides to merge the party with the Maoists, a huge number of our party cadres will join the UML. Unity between the UML and the Unified Socialist is natural because we grew up in the same background and orientation. But we are quite different from Maoists. Several groups trying to form new political outfits have failed to emerge as a major political force and sustain themselves. You worked in a big party for years and also helped establish a new one. What are the challenges of forming a new political organisation in Nepal?Political parties sustain if they evolve with society. If you trace the history of the Nepal’s Congress and communist parties, you will see how they have evolved over the past seven decades. They competed against each other but joined hands to fight autocratic forces towards establishing democracy. They have done hundreds of progressive things in society. Their major fault is that they have multiple entry points but no exit policy. The only exit way is the death of the leaders. This has caused unhealthy practices and created dissident groups.The dissidents who didn’t get any space within their party formed new outfits. They also amplified negative narratives against the old parties. It happened with the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre. Had there been an exit system in the party, the situation wouldn’t be this bad. But new political parties can’t sustain without their own political ideology and orientation. You may form an organisation, cash in on people’s frustration and achieve some immediate gains, but outfits can’t sustain.But recent electoral trends show that Nepalis are seeking alternative forces and new faces. Can we be oblivious to that?You are right. We have seen such trends in the Panchayat system as well. But garnering votes during elections for one term and establishing a sustainable political force are two different things.  ","summary":"CPN (Unified Socialist) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri was among the most active leaders involved in the formation of the party after split with the CPN-UML in 2021.

On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution? Doesn’t that violate the mandate the parties got through the elections? Generally, the constitution might be reviewed after 10 years of its implementation. But we haven’t implemented it in a full-fledged way as we don’t even have all the laws required for its effective implementation. We have just agreed to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. So, the proposal to amend the constitution without first completing the basics required for its implementation is wrong. They want to make changes in the proportional inclusive system of our constitution. A political force can work to secure a majority in the House through general elections and ensure stability in the country. We accept that. We have also been lobbying for a directly elected executive president for political stability. They are not ready to debate on that. But they want to revoke the inclusive system, a major achievement of the 2006 people’s movement. This system has empowered historically excluded and deprived communities. We have to enhance the capacity of these groups instead of depriving them of their rights. If there are anomalies in the system’s implementation, let’s develop methods to more effectively pick our representatives. But the ruling parties seem intent on turning back the clock. Some leaders have publicly announced that they want to end the role of small parties. There can be a number of political parties in a country like Nepal, which is rich in social diversity. We adopted federalism for the same purpose. The leaders give priority to their family members and loyal ones while selecting election candidates and blame the constitution for the ensuing mistakes. They want to rule the country indefinitely through a two-party system. So we think the Congress-UML alliance is on the path of regression. Republicanism, federalism, secularism, inclusion and socialism-oriented systems are integrated five pillars of the present constitution. No attack on them will be tolerated. This is one focus of our ongoing meeting. We are also discussing some fresh international issues such as the developments in Bangladesh. We have yet to get a complete picture from there. But we can still learn some things. The centre of global affairs is changing and shifting to Asia. More importantly, there is a strong influence of such geopolitical forces in Nepal as well.Party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that there was an external hand in the recent change of coalition.External elements are active, in one way or the other. Some want to make our country a playground of external forces but our party and party chair firmly stood against it. The forces that wanted various things but didn’t get them from the government then started searching for a character suitable for them. People aren’t aware of such unseen elements but we should be careful. In the meeting, we are discussing this issue as well.Do you think geopolitics is the major reason for the ouster of the Dahal-led government?In his third term as a prime minister, Prachanda was working with certain priorities such as good governance, social justice and prosperity. He had taken governance seriously. Previously, there was a practice of exploiting state coffers in collusion between politicians, big businessmen and bureaucrats. The Prachanda-led government strongly stood against such a nexus. Actions against those involved in Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Bansbari Leather Shoe land scam, and gold smuggling are some examples. The government formulated a law to address the problems of loan shark victims. But some individuals associated with the coalition partners were involved in the scams. Were these bad elements linked to the Congress or the UML? Dahal entered into coalitions with both.The individuals were linked to partners in both the coalitions. The party chair made good governance his main priority but the Maoist Centre is the third-largest party so his hands were tied. When certain individuals were brought under investigation in corruption cases, the initiatives to change the government were expedited overnight. We can conclude that Prachanda government’s anti-corruption moves inspired other parties to oust it.You mentioned external interference as well as other parties’ fear of the government’s anti-corruption actions. Which one was the major reason for government change?The government’s anti-corruption drive is the main reason behind the formation of the new coalition. This drive brought the two largest parties together to form a government, which is unusual in the parliamentary system. The government is working to increase the threshold to secure seats under the proportional representation category. The proposed provision is against small parties, and the Maoist Centre has opposed this. Do you see the possibility of polarisation among the parties on this issue?When the ruling parties introduce new proposals that were not even discussed during the elections, we will definitely oppose them. We led the previous movements for people’s rights and we have to secure these rights. Thus the polarisation between those who want to trample on the statute and those who are against such attacks is inevitable. Is the Maoist Centre preparing to unify with other parties including the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand Biplab?First, we are in the final stage of merging with the outfit of Mahindra Raya Yadav. Also, the Biplab-led party has endorsed the party unity proposal. We have to iron out some theoretical issues and make the party line clear in the changed national as well as international context. Dialogue between us is headed in the right direction.You earlier said party chair has urged other leaders to openly debate issues. Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on. ","summary":"The CPN (Maoist Centre) has either led or been a part of the government for most of the past decade and half. But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly.

He has studied and written extensively on water resources, trans-boundary water cooperation, flood management, wash services and climate change adaptation, clean energy transition and related policy studies. In this interview with the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal, Dixit discusses river management in Nepal’s urban areas: Where have we gone wrong in this endeavour and what can we do? You have extensively studied river systems and have been following changes seen in river basins. How do you see recent problems caused by encroachment and rampant development activities?We humans have lived and have to continue to live within water cycles: water evaporates from the ocean to the sky and then precipitates to the land and flows via rivers back to the ocean. Rivers that function as arteries of the land surface, sustaining humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems face widespread abuses: pollution, rampant extraction of their bed and banks, fragmentation and degradation. Without rivers, we would not be who we are. Unfortunately, we have forgotten this essence. We neglect and abuse rivers. In 1981, just after the monsoon ended, I, along with my students, walked from Sundarijal to Teku studying Bagmati rivers’ sediment. At many places, we walked on the riverbed. The river then was clean. Gradually, the river systems began to face all-round decay. I have read painful accounts of my contemporaries who remember swimming in the clean Bagmati and its tributaries. In less than 50 years, our rivers in Kathmandu Valley and other basins no longer look like rivers. I feel helpless and ache with pain at this collective failure! What state of rivers are we passing on to our next generation?River encroachment is common across Nepal but more serious in urban areas, including in Kathmandu. How can this be stopped?Our approach to rivers is an imitation of the trend common across South Asia, or the subcontinent, which is again largely based on the knowledge system developed in the industrialised Global North without contextualising locally. The region features waterscapes of high and punctuated rainfall during the monsoon months, rivers, wetlands, ponds, and springs, all connected with groundwater aquifers in one of the most complex landscapes of the world: the Himalaya-Ganga region. Yet, current development endeavours subjugate water rather than respect and live with it. In 2022, the Indus River in Pakistan faced major floods with devastating consequences. Referring to these floods, a group of global scientists stated that “the impacts [of the floods] were the outcome of an outdated river management system.” This approach is primarily based on building of physical structures such as buildings, bridges and roads close to rivers interfering with their natural flows. The approach that began in the early twentieth century keeps marching on even while we are facing twenty first century water challenges.There is an increasing trend of building corridor roads along the rivers in Kathmandu as well as other places. Is this a good or bad practice? In Nepal, road building in the hills has earned the sobriquet of “dozer roads,” meaning politically designed roads excavated by heavy machine operators without adhering to basic engineering, social, environmental, or hydrological safeguards. Even highways built with “engineering,” such as the Mugling-Narayanghat section, face regular accidents. The sliding of the two buses in the Trishuli is the recent example. Building roads along the banks of rivers, defined as “river corridors,” is the preferred approach for improving connectivity. In the Kathmandu Valley, this is also associated with rivers shackled within concrete walls in the name of river beautification. In the monsoon, however, they all overflow as we have been seeing in the last few years and this year as well.What will happen to these rivers 10-15 years down the line? Is there any chance of some of our rivers dying? Or, will the measures taken in recent times protect them?All rivers must flow clean and free in selected stretches. But today, rivers are disconnected with their floodplains. Within walls and embankments, they have become conduits of filth. Many rivers are already seriously degraded. If the current trend continues, many rivers may die. I remember Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, filmmaker, and author, who wrote: “Water and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.” Our current efforts at conserving, developing and managing rivers are grossly inadequate. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw some rivers heal as human actions across the board ceased due to the lockdown. But this healing came at huge human and economic costs. The lessons, however, are clear. We must stop turning rivers into garbage cans for them to begin to heal. The onus lies on us, our activities, our governance, and the policies we make and put into practice effectively. We need new ways of imagining rivers in harmony with human needs. Otherwise, the rivers will die. If rivers die, what will become of us?What problems may city dwellers face as a result of this continued destruction of rivers?A 2020 analysis of rivers in Nepal found that the quality of rivers in the mid-hills and the Tarai are already deteriorating. Industries, cities, towns, and agriculture produce waste that, when disposed of in rivers untreated, cause pollution. Solid and liquid wastes produced by expanding cities and towns pollute nearby rivers, streams, and water bodies. Pollution kills aquatic life such as fish, which are sources of livelihood for many communities. Polluted rivers and water bodies degrade human and environmental health, leading to negative impacts on human livelihoods. The impacts of pollution on rivers are considerable during non-monsoon months when river discharge, and consequently the capacity of rivers to dilute waste, are low.What should be done to conserve the rivers, at least in the present form, and stop further damages?All rivers are a combination of water (W), energy (E), biodiversity aquatic (B), and sediment (S), represented by the acronym WEBS. In the current scheme of things, the focus is on water and energy. Aquatic ecosystems are the concern of only those working on freshwater ecosystems. They are neglected in the larger context though the state has made some provisions for conserving ecosystems. In Nepal’s Hydropower Development Policy of 2001 all hydropower plants must release 10 percent minimum flow to the downstream reaches to enable fish and other aquatic life to survive in the river. A 2021 study of 50 hydropower plants however found that none of the plants surveyed release environmental-flows. All hydropower plants, as per their power purchasing agreements, are required to produce maximum power during the dry season. We should start by accepting the fact that rivers need clean flowing water and respecting the policies we have made. Then we must systematically introduce changes and avoid the oversights embedded in the present approach. The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems. In the present approach, nobody seems to want sediment which is a natural consequence of flow within the water cycle.To meet such an objective, we need to begin with a system of integrated knowledge that synthesises natural science, social science, and indigenous practices. By incorporating fields such as hydrology, ecology, social science-supported context-specific engineering, and indigenous knowledge and practices, we can take a comprehensive approach to water management challenges and solutions. Interdisciplinary approaches can build collaboration, innovation, and systemic decision-making and promote innovative water management for the benefit of both ecosystems and human societies.Do you think initiatives such as river clean up campaigns run by various groups help protect these waterways?I see such initiatives as manifestation of dissatisfaction of concerned citizens with the degradation of rivers and to bring about changes. In 1990, I was part of the Save Bagmati Campaign, which aimed to highlight the degrading state of the river. This campaign has taken many new forms, and citizen groups have begun campaigns in other rivers of Nepal. They however remain fragmented and ad-hoc. Similar campaigns in some countries have led to granting rights to rivers. In 2017, New Zealand recognised the Whanganui River and its tributaries as legal entities, acknowledging their physical and spiritual significance as “living and indivisible” and ensuring their survival, health, and integrity to balance the needs of humans and nature. Promulgations like Living Indus (Pakistan), Namami Gange river-improvement programme (India) can offer lessons for a holistic water journey. The collective voice of concerned citizens for the integrity of rivers can be a powerful medium for policy and pathway changes. Nepal must also begin country-wide river restoration initiatives. We need more dialogue and conversation around water challenges and solutions.As cities turn into concrete jungles, their water tables are said to be receding alarmingly. You often propose redesigning our settlements and development infrastructure in a way that wouldn’t disturb rivers’ natural courses and catchment areas. Could you elaborate?South Asia is a region of waterscapes containing streams, ponds, wetlands, open spaces, floodplains, springs, and underground aquifers. Yet, our towns, cities, and infrastructure are planned, designed, and built to disregard water rather than live with it. As land-centric urban growth dominates, waterscapes temporarily seem to vanish but later water comes back. In Nepali we have a saying “In twelve years a stream returns”. The present practice of urban development is obsessed with concretisation, making these areas impermeable. Rainwater, part of which would naturally infiltrate the ground, now immediately reaches the rivers already constrained by walls. The river at a downstream section immediately peaks and when the rainfall stops the river has very low discharge. Basic parameters, like the intensity of rainfall (mm per hour), are poorly recognised and used in design guidelines. The interaction of current urbanisation practices and increasing extreme rainfall, temperature and humidity rise spawned by climate change and urban heat island effects will make our urban areas as crucible of hazards, and unhealthy. A new urban future must harmoniously integrate nature, including water bodies and wetlands, and preserve natural land cover, including traditional ponds to promote groundwater recharge. It can be further achieved by preserving green open spaces, forests, gardens, permeable “sponge” pavements, and natural waterfronts for healthier communities in sustainable cities. The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving rivers’ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey.

The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems. In the present approach, nobody seems to want sediment which is a natural consequence of flow within the water cycle.To meet such an objective, we need to begin with a system of integrated knowledge that synthesises natural science, social science, and indigenous practices. By incorporating fields such as hydrology, ecology, social science-supported context-specific engineering, and indigenous knowledge and practices, we can take a comprehensive approach to water management challenges and solutions. Interdisciplinary approaches can build collaboration, innovation, and systemic decision-making and promote innovative water management for the benefit of both ecosystems and human societies.Do you think initiatives such as river clean up campaigns run by various groups help protect these waterways?I see such initiatives as manifestation of dissatisfaction of concerned citizens with the degradation of rivers and to bring about changes. In 1990, I was part of the Save Bagmati Campaign, which aimed to highlight the degrading state of the river. This campaign has taken many new forms, and citizen groups have begun campaigns in other rivers of Nepal. They however remain fragmented and ad-hoc. Similar campaigns in some countries have led to granting rights to rivers. In 2017, New Zealand recognised the Whanganui River and its tributaries as legal entities, acknowledging their physical and spiritual significance as “living and indivisible” and ensuring their survival, health, and integrity to balance the needs of humans and nature. Promulgations like Living Indus (Pakistan), Namami Gange river-improvement programme (India) can offer lessons for a holistic water journey. The collective voice of concerned citizens for the integrity of rivers can be a powerful medium for policy and pathway changes. Nepal must also begin country-wide river restoration initiatives. We need more dialogue and conversation around water challenges and solutions.As cities turn into concrete jungles, their water tables are said to be receding alarmingly. You often propose redesigning our settlements and development infrastructure in a way that wouldn’t disturb rivers’ natural courses and catchment areas. Could you elaborate?South Asia is a region of waterscapes containing streams, ponds, wetlands, open spaces, floodplains, springs, and underground aquifers. Yet, our towns, cities, and infrastructure are planned, designed, and built to disregard water rather than live with it. As land-centric urban growth dominates, waterscapes temporarily seem to vanish but later water comes back. In Nepali we have a saying “In twelve years a stream returns”. The present practice of urban development is obsessed with concretisation, making these areas impermeable. Rainwater, part of which would naturally infiltrate the ground, now immediately reaches the rivers already constrained by walls. The river at a downstream section immediately peaks and when the rainfall stops the river has very low discharge. Basic parameters, like the intensity of rainfall (mm per hour), are poorly recognised and used in design guidelines. The interaction of current urbanisation practices and increasing extreme rainfall, temperature and humidity rise spawned by climate change and urban heat island effects will make our urban areas as crucible of hazards, and unhealthy. A new urban future must harmoniously integrate nature, including water bodies and wetlands, and preserve natural land cover, including traditional ponds to promote groundwater recharge. It can be further achieved by preserving green open spaces, forests, gardens, permeable “sponge” pavements, and natural waterfronts for healthier communities in sustainable cities. The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving rivers’ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey.
