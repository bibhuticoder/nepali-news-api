The taskforce, comprising Ramesh Lekhak of the Nepali Congress, Mahesh Bartaula of the CPN-UML, and Janardan Sharma of the CPN (Maoist Centre), was formed on July 1 after the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives failed to forge on agreement on the bill, mainly over four issues.After a month-long discussion, the panel managed to find consensus on all the issues. There has been an agreement to list intentional and arbitrary killings as serious violations of human rights and to reduce the sentence of the guilty in serious violations of human rights by 75 percent. A victim who is unwilling to reconcile can move the court against the perpetrators.All the disqualified Maoist combatants including child soldiers, along with the families of security personnel who lost their lives or were injured during the insurgency, will get reparation and compensation, as per the agreement.“All the contentious issues have been resolved. Today’s [Thursday] agreement has paved the way for the conclusion of the transitional justice process,” said Bartaula, claiming the agreement had kept the victims at centre. The three-party representatives will jointly present their report to their top leaders. The Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee will then endorse the bill by incorporating the agreed points and forward it to the House. After this, the bill must be endorsed by both the chambers of the federal parliament to come into effect.The panel members claim that the door has opened to deliver justice to the victims of the 1996-2006 insurgency who have had to wait for it for around two decades. “An important agreement has been forged today [Thursday]. Our transitional justice process will be established as a successful model globally,” said the Maoist Centre’s Sharma.But conflict victims have expressed their reservations on some of the provisions the mechanism has agreed on. Gopal Shah, chairperson of the Conflict Victims’ National Network, termed the agreement a “sugar-coated poison”.“The wording looks good, but it cannot deliver justice to the victims. Reduced sentencing aims to provide amnesty to the guilty after symbolic action,” he said. “The parties don’t want proper legal action for serious violations of human rights.”Shah said the transitional justice process cannot be complete without providing justice to former Maoist child soldiers.The panel has agreed not to include minor child soldiers in the bill as the Maoist Centre would strongly oppose any such inclusion. Among the 4,008 Maoist combatants who did not qualify for integration into the Nepal Army, 2,973 were verified as minors by a United Nations mission. They are yet to get substantial support, except for a few thousand rupees given by the UN while they were discharged. Human rights activists also see several lapses in the agreed provisions. Charan Prasai, a human rights defender, said the agreement is guided by the larger goal of shielding perpetrators. “A political agreement alone is useless unless the victims have faith in the process. The current agreement only protects the perpetrators,” he said. The transitional justice process cannot be completed without addressing crimes against humanity and war crimes, according to Prasai. Neither the existing Act nor the amendment bill mentions these crimes. The former warring parties—the Maoists and the state security forces—maintain that no acts of crime against humanity and war crimes ever happened in Nepal.Not all stakeholders are opposed to the agreement though. A section of the victims has welcomed the deal claiming that there was some hope for justice after a long time. Ram Bhandari, a rights activist whose father was forcibly disappeared by the state security forces, welcomed the agreement and said the focus should now be towards ensuring that the transitional justice commissions get the right leadership.The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons have been paralysed for over two years in absence of chairpersons and members. Their appointment process will commence with the Act’s endorsement. “We now want organisational representation of victims in the reparation mechanism,” said Bhandari. He claimed that the transitional justice process has been delayed as more focus was given to criminal prosecution while ignoring other pillars of the process.“We hope the long pending task of transitional justice will be expedited and the victims will get reparations while other processes take their course,” Bhandari said. In its verdict on a writ petition jointly filed by dozens of conflict victims, the Supreme Court in February 2015 had turned down several provisions in the Act as they allowed amnesties in serious violations of human rights. Nine years after the ruling, the Act is yet to be amended despite several attempts to do so. The leaders in the three-party task force say the Act will be amended in the ongoing session of Parliament, marking the resumption of the long stalled transitional justice process. “We are confident that the transitional justice process will be completed in the next four years by ensuring justice to all the victims,” said Bartaula.Records show that as many as 3,223 complaints of enforced disappearances implicating either security forces or the Maoists have been lodged at the Disappearances Commission. It has picked for investigation 2,494 cases falling under its jurisdiction. Similarly, 63,718 complaints have been registered with the Truth Commission.

In its verdict on a writ petition jointly filed by dozens of conflict victims, the Supreme Court in February 2015 had turned down several provisions in the Act as they allowed amnesties in serious violations of human rights. Nine years after the ruling, the Act is yet to be amended despite several attempts to do so. The leaders in the three-party task force say the Act will be amended in the ongoing session of Parliament, marking the resumption of the long stalled transitional justice process. “We are confident that the transitional justice process will be completed in the next four years by ensuring justice to all the victims,” said Bartaula.Records show that as many as 3,223 complaints of enforced disappearances implicating either security forces or the Maoists have been lodged at the Disappearances Commission. It has picked for investigation 2,494 cases falling under its jurisdiction. Similarly, 63,718 complaints have been registered with the Truth Commission.

On Thursday, the Development, Economic Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the National Assembly resumed discussions on the draft of the policy. Sher Bahadur Deuba, soon after becoming prime minister on June 8, 2017, had pushed for this policy’s formulation. A secretary at the Prime Minister’s Office said the policy had been gathering dust for five years, but now they were considering moving it forward.The proposed policy requires those appointed to constitutional posts to sign an affidavit stating that they do not belong to any political party. It also states that the judiciary and constitutional bodies should not allow anyone to get perks or benefits not permitted by the law. Also, it proposes that teachers should not be members of any political party, and if they are, they must quit party membership.Similarly, those holding positions in constitutional bodies cannot go abroad without informing the government, and they should notify the Ministry of Foreign Affairs if they need to travel for private reasons. The proposed policy also bars constitutional bodies, security agencies, and the judiciary from receiving direct assistance from national and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs).The policy has separate provisions and regulations for NGOs and INGOs working inside Nepal. The NGO community had opposed some of the policy’s provisions. The document under consideration has a 13-point policy for NGOs and 25-point policy for INGOs.Speaking at the meeting of the upper house committee, members said that the integrity policy should be effectively implemented across all organs and levels of government. Urmila Aryal, an upper house member, said the government should be responsible for maintaining integrity in all sectors. “We need the right leadership, policy, and approach,” she said.Another member, Jhakku Prasad Subedi, also asked the government to bring the integrity policy and implement it effectively. “In order to make political and bureaucratic leadership disciplined, accountable and vigilant, we need a certain code of conduct,” he said. “Moral commitment is important as it stands above the law and the constitution.” Another member of the upper house, Bamdev Gautam, said that the state should impose the integrity policy through legislation. “Simply bringing out a policy is not enough. The government should formulate a law in order to enforce it.”Other members, like Tul Prasad Bishawkarma and Ghanshyam Rijal, stated that Nepali society is very weak in terms of adhering to codes and ethics, “so it is the primary job of the political parties to first ensure that their leaders are clean.”Some members said that certain lawmakers with criminal records have become ministers, which goes against the basic principles of the constitution, political norms, and ethics. The proposed policy prohibits NGOs and INGOs from engaging in activities that incite hatred against Nepal.Any NGO that is aware that an INGO or foreigner is trying to sow communal discord should inform the government authorities. Also, INGOs working inside Nepal cannot send reports to foreign countries without the consent of the Nepal government. For INGOs, the draft policy states that their annual programmes and budget to be approved by the Finance Ministry should not influence the drafting of Nepal’s laws and policies. INGOs are also barred from implementing projects independently, and from sending their reports to their home countries without seeking permission from the government of Nepal.Similarly, while operating inside Nepal, each INGO should fix the number of foreign officials, refrain from imposing foreign religious, social and other agenda, and ensure that foreign staffers do not remain in the same position for more than three years. Likewise, INGOs failing to renew their registration within three months would be scrapped, as would those engaged in proselytisation, according to the draft policy.In the case of NGOs, the proposed policy stated that they should be classified on the basis of sources of funds, and requires them to obtain permission from the Ministry of Finance to receive donations. Also, NGOs should inform the Ministry of Finance and the local administration within seven days of receiving donations. Likewise, their administrative costs must not exceed a specified percentage of the total budget. NGOs failing to renew their registration for three months would be scrapped; more than two persons of a family cannot hold executive positions of an organisation, and a person should not remain in the same executive position for more than two terms. Likewise, public office holders have been barred from being involved in NGOs and INGOs.Two former secretaries, Mohan Banjade and Sharada Prasad Trital, drafted the 23-page paper, suggesting policies for political parties, NGOs, INGOs, the diplomatic community, constitutional bodies, professors and teachers, the private sector and cooperatives. Several national and international stakeholders, including the Human Rights Watch, the Nepali NGO fraternity, and Asian Human Rights Commission had expressed reservations over the draft, forcing the Oli government to halt its implementation in 2018.

The programme is supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies in partnership with the World Health Organisation and Vital Strategies.“We have got 17 air quality sensors, which are portable and can be set up at any location,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department under the city office. “Those sensors are being calibrated with ground stations for air quality monitoring installed by various agencies to reduce errors.”Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year, and the capital city often becomes the world’s most polluted metropolis. Major hospitals report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Doctors say even if cases of respiratory illnesses surge during winter and as the season changes across the world, in Nepal, people get sick throughout the year due to polluted air.Metropolitan officials claim that air quality sensors, which are also called low-cost sensors, are widely acknowledged for bringing about a paradigm shift in supplemental traditional air monitoring.“We hope that these sensors will help us in monitoring the air quality, take decisions on mitigation measures and formulate policies,” said Shrestha. Once the sensors come into operation, the KMC will be the first local unit in the country monitoring air quality on its own.“Air quality sensors do not need electricity, as they will be equipped with solar panels, and also do not need wifi,” said Engineer Sanjeeb Pandey, project lead of Partnership for Healthy Cities. “These sensors will provide real time data of air quality.”Doctors say air pollution is known to cause various respiratory illnesses. Poor air quality can cause short- and long-term effects on public health. In the short term, it can lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems, and in the long run it can lead to severe conditions like ulcers, and cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, and heart complications.People in low- and middle-income countries get disproportionately affected by the polluted air, which accounts for more than 90 percent of deaths, according to the World Health Organisation.Several studies carried out in the past in Nepal show that toxic air takes a huge toll on public health. Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke, according to experts.The report, titled “Global burden and strength of evidence for 88 risk factors in 204 countries and 811 subnational locations, 1990–2021: A systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021,” finds that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent). The report was published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively, according to the report.Environment experts in Nepal often point out that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development of the country.

The Nepal Rastra Bank’s own stock amounts to Rs1.75 trillion.The central bank said on Thursday that it amended the unified directives to allow Nepali citizens travelling abroad to carry $2,500 per trip. Earlier, Nepali citizens were allowed $2,500 twice a year.“Two years ago, we set the limitation on foreign exchange facilities in view of the country’s depleting foreign exchange reserves. Now we have amended the unified guidelines and removed the frequency limit as resources have improved. It will be helpful for frequent travellers,” said Ramu Paudel, spokesperson for the central bank.However, the limit of the amount of currency available remains unchanged. The amendments are based on the central bank's recently announced monetary policy for the current fiscal year.Similarly, the central bank has doubled the foreign currencies available to Nepali citizens travelling to Tibet, China, and the SAARC countries. Nepali citizens travelling to Tibet via surface route can now get an exchange facility of $1,000 one time and $2,000 in a fiscal year. This will also apply to Nepalis travelling to the SAARC countries, excluding India, via surface route.This provision, however, will not apply to the residents of border regions who make frequent travels to Tibet.The country’s foreign currency stock has been breaking records in recent months, mainly due to a robust remittance growth and ever-increasing migrant departures to foreign lands in search of better incomes.Economists say that robust forex reserves suggest a scenario of low investments, particularly in a least developed country like Nepal.In June 2022, Nepal’s foreign exchange reserves slid to a critical level that could sustain imports of goods for less than six months. Even the central bank's import controls did not improve the situation.Instead, the measures nearly suffocated Nepal’s economy, according to the International Monetary Fund.Following the Russia-Ukraine war, which choked the global supply system and caused prices to rise like never before, Nepal, too, suffered chronic current account deficits and was increasingly vulnerable to external economic shocks, while forex reserves dwindled fast.In late April 2022, the government banned imports of at least 10 goods considered luxury or non-essential in a bid to stop the country’s foreign exchange reserves from depleting further. The ban was lifted in December 2022.Paudel said that the foreign exchange ceiling has gone higher not only due to the improving forex reserve situation but also to prevent the hassles that travellers and traders are facing.People who travel frequently despite the limited forex convertibility were facing the problem of submitting documents required by the central bank, he said. “The amended provision will help such travellers.”The central bank has also amended the foreign exchange limitation for traders.According to the amended provision, traders who import goods through demand draft and telegraphic transfer are allowed to import goods of $100,000 at once, up from $60,000 before.Paudel said that the traders ordering goods beyond the limitations are required to submit documents to the central bank.But with the amendment, they can access needed facilities from any commercial bank.The amended provision has increased the payment limitation to import silver.Bullion traders importing silver to produce silver jewellery, artistic goods, and utensils, among other things, can get a foreign exchange facility of $300,000 per import. The other bullion traders importing silver can get a foreign exchange facility of $100,000 per import.The foreign exchange limitation for companies outsourcing services from foreign countries and invisible imports by domestic companies and their sister concerns has increased to $25,000 monthly from $15,000 monthly.

All ministries except the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the government said, were reportedly working on at least one bill and around 35 bills would be registered within a few months. However, the Dahal administration failed to walk the talk.

Likewise, as many as 2,061 people from 73 districts have tested positive for dengue. Health facilities across the country have been grappling with a surge in water- and vector-borne diseases. “Infection of the dengue virus has not risen this time compared to the previous years,” said Ghimire. “Ongoing rain has contaminated drinking water sources which increases the risk of potential outbreaks of waterborne diseases in the coming days.”According to data provided by the division, among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases at 249, followed by Jhapa 130, Chitwan 105, Tanahun 87, Makawanpur 78, Kaski 74, Bhojpur 62, Kavrepalanchok 60, and Okhaldhunga with 59 cases.Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. They concede that the outbreaks of the deadly disease are being reported only from the districts having active case surveillance programmes. Active cholera surveillance is being carried out from 27 health facilities in Kathmandu Valley and 10 in Kailali district.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snakebites—in the coming days.The Ministry of Health and Population last month urged provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season and step up vigilance about the potential risks.Officials say that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks and directed agencies concerned to stockpile essential medicines.Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection.

When I was involved in expanding the work of the mangalbare discussion group of Chautari and in founding SINHAS, both in 1995, no one asked me what the business plans for these projects were. If anyone had asked, I would have had to tell them they did not exist. And if the existence of such plans were a prerequisite for these projects, they would have never taken off to become important platforms for public discourse and academic publications related to Nepal. I wrote about the discussion series in an earlier column of the Post (“Chautari guff at 32”, November 10, 2023).The idea of SINHAS emanated from a spontaneous proposal made by our publisher, Madhab Lal Maharjan, to me when I was visiting his shop, Mandala Book Point, some day in 1994. I made no immediate commitment to him. I returned to the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) in late 1994 to complete my doctoral dissertation. The final decision to start SINHAS was made in the summer of 1995 following conversations between Mary Des Chene, Mark Liechty and myself in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Lazima Onta-Bhatta was invited to join the team. We decided that each journal volume would consist of two issues—each about 200 pages thick—published in June and December of each year. Then, Madhab and we made a simple oral agreement: The editors would prepare the “camera-ready” copy of each issue, and he would publish, distribute and sell it. The first issue of SINHAS was published in August 1996. A “foolish” decisionReflecting on the decision to start SINHAS, I would say that it represented the collective “foolishness” of the four founding editors. How so?Think about the “standing” of the founding team in 1995: Here were four people, two of whom were early career post-PhD researchers, and the other two doctoral students still writing their dissertations. The most senior of the lot, Mary, had finished her PhD in anthropology from Stanford University in 1991 with a dissertation titled “Relics of Empire: A Cultural History of the Gurkhas, 1815-1987.” She published an article in the Himalayan Research Bulletin in 1992 and a second one in the South Asia Bulletin in 1993. In 1995, apart from teaching, she was crafting articles for other journals and edited volumes. She had published at least two book reviews in academic journals by then, and might have even peer-reviewed a manuscript or two for some journals.The second post-PhD researcher in our team, Mark Liechty, obtained his PhD in anthropology from UPenn in December 1994, writing a dissertation titled “Fashioning Modernity in Kathmandu: Mass Media, Consumer Culture, and the Middle Class in Nepal.” He had spent the first six months of 1995 as a postdoctoral fellow at the International Institute for Asian Studies in Leiden, the Netherlands. While there, he finished the final draft of his article, “Kathmandu as Translocality: Multiple Places in a Nepali Space,” published in 1996 in the edited volume Geography of Identity. Before going to Leiden, Mark finished another article on youth identities and the experience of modernity in Kathmandu, published in 1995 in the edited volume Youth Cultures: A Cross-Cultural Perspective. Hence, by mid-1995, although two of his articles in two separate edited volumes were in various stages of the pre-press process, Mark had not even submitted an article to a journal for review. He published a book review in 1993 but does not remember doing any official peer reviews for any journal until then.In July 1995, I was still a year away from finishing my PhD in history at UPenn. During the hot summer of 1995 in Philadelphia, I was writing my dissertation, “The Politics of Bravery: A History of Nepali Nationalism.” Some months earlier, I had published a full-length article under the title “Rich Possibilities: Notes on Social History in Nepal” in Contributions to Nepalese Studies, which was the most prominent journal of Nepal Studies at that time. That submission had not undergone a rigorous peer review process but was finely copy-edited before publication. By then, I had published reviews of academic books in three journals. Still, I had not done any official peer review of any article manuscript written by others for any journal. In the early summer of 1995, Lazima, the fourth founder of SINHAS, was still doing her anthropological fieldwork in Kathmandu on the subject of street children. At that time, she had not published anything in academic journals. Later that year, she returned to the US to begin writing her doctoral dissertation, which eventually got submitted to Cornell University in 2000 under the title “Street Children’s Subcultures and Cultural Politics of Childhood in Nepal.” So here was a group of four researchers—two early post-doctoral ones and two doctoral students—who had certainly read thousands of journal articles between them during their graduate training but whose collective experience of writing for academic journals was limited to just three published full-length articles in total! Three members of this group had never done an official peer review of any article manuscript submitted to any journal. None of them had worked as a proper editorial assistant in any academic journal team previously. In other disciplinary domains, early career researchers cut their journal editing teeth by working first as junior members of the editorial collective of some journals. Later on, they are offered associate and eventually full editorial positions in those same or other journals. But here was our team, deciding to establish a new journal of Nepal Studies without such experience. Surely, we were well read in Nepali history and society, but collectively, we had minimal knowledge of the intricate processes that generate academic journals. Hence, the decision to establish SINHAS was a “foolish” reflection of the collective youth and naivety of the four founding editors.Portable lessonsGiven its current standing among practitioners of Nepal Studies, I would have to say that SINHAS has done pretty well in its 29 years of existence despite not having a “business plan.” We have learnt to run the journal while securing and editing good articles that enhance our collective understanding of Nepali history and society. That raises this question: Does every project in life need a business plan? I clearly don’t think so. For many aspects of how a democratic society ought to function, we probably need individuals committed long-term to specific ideas and projects more than business plans for them. Such individuals should have the freedom to “foolishly” launch public-serving projects without worrying about business plans. I am glad that back in 1995, I did not have to respond to folks who were married to the idea of business plans for everything, whether a discussion forum or a journal. There should be ample room for spontaneity, public-serving naivety and experiential serendipity in any society that likes to call itself loktantrik.   ","summary":"Every time someone mentions “business plan,” I think about two of the major projects of my life—the discussion series run by Martin Chautari and the academic journal Studies in Nepali History and Society (SINHAS). When I was involved in expanding the work of the mangalbare discussion group of Chautari and in founding SINHAS, both in 1995, no one asked me what the business plans for these projects were. If anyone had asked, I would have had to tell them they did not exist. And if the existence of such plans were a prerequisite for these projects, they would have never taken off to become important platforms for public discourse and academic publications related to Nepal. I wrote about the discussion series in an earlier column of the Post (“Chautari guff at 32”, November 10, 2023).The idea of SINHAS emanated from a spontaneous proposal made by our publisher, Madhab Lal Maharjan, to me when I was visiting his shop, Mandala Book Point, some day in 1994. I made no immediate commitment to him. I returned to the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) in late 1994 to complete my doctoral dissertation. The final decision to start SINHAS was made in the summer of 1995 following conversations between Mary Des Chene, Mark Liechty and myself in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Lazima Onta-Bhatta was invited to join the team. We decided that each journal volume would consist of two issues—each about 200 pages thick—published in June and December of each year. Then, Madhab and we made a simple oral agreement: The editors would prepare the “camera-ready” copy of each issue, and he would publish, distribute and sell it. The first issue of SINHAS was published in August 1996. A “foolish” decisionReflecting on the decision to start SINHAS, I would say that it represented the collective “foolishness” of the four founding editors. How so?Think about the “standing” of the founding team in 1995: Here were four people, two of whom were early career post-PhD researchers, and the other two doctoral students still writing their dissertations. The most senior of the lot, Mary, had finished her PhD in anthropology from Stanford University in 1991 with a dissertation titled “Relics of Empire: A Cultural History of the Gurkhas, 1815-1987.” She published an article in the Himalayan Research Bulletin in 1992 and a second one in the South Asia Bulletin in 1993. In 1995, apart from teaching, she was crafting articles for other journals and edited volumes. She had published at least two book reviews in academic journals by then, and might have even peer-reviewed a manuscript or two for some journals.The second post-PhD researcher in our team, Mark Liechty, obtained his PhD in anthropology from UPenn in December 1994, writing a dissertation titled “Fashioning Modernity in Kathmandu: Mass Media, Consumer Culture, and the Middle Class in Nepal.” He had spent the first six months of 1995 as a postdoctoral fellow at the International Institute for Asian Studies in Leiden, the Netherlands. While there, he finished the final draft of his article, “Kathmandu as Translocality: Multiple Places in a Nepali Space,” published in 1996 in the edited volume Geography of Identity. Before going to Leiden, Mark finished another article on youth identities and the experience of modernity in Kathmandu, published in 1995 in the edited volume Youth Cultures: A Cross-Cultural Perspective. Hence, by mid-1995, although two of his articles in two separate edited volumes were in various stages of the pre-press process, Mark had not even submitted an article to a journal for review. He published a book review in 1993 but does not remember doing any official peer reviews for any journal until then.In July 1995, I was still a year away from finishing my PhD in history at UPenn. During the hot summer of 1995 in Philadelphia, I was writing my dissertation, “The Politics of Bravery: A History of Nepali Nationalism.” Some months earlier, I had published a full-length article under the title “Rich Possibilities: Notes on Social History in Nepal” in Contributions to Nepalese Studies, which was the most prominent journal of Nepal Studies at that time. That submission had not undergone a rigorous peer review process but was finely copy-edited before publication. By then, I had published reviews of academic books in three journals. Still, I had not done any official peer review of any article manuscript written by others for any journal. In the early summer of 1995, Lazima, the fourth founder of SINHAS, was still doing her anthropological fieldwork in Kathmandu on the subject of street children. At that time, she had not published anything in academic journals. Later that year, she returned to the US to begin writing her doctoral dissertation, which eventually got submitted to Cornell University in 2000 under the title “Street Children’s Subcultures and Cultural Politics of Childhood in Nepal.” So here was a group of four researchers—two early post-doctoral ones and two doctoral students—who had certainly read thousands of journal articles between them during their graduate training but whose collective experience of writing for academic journals was limited to just three published full-length articles in total! Three members of this group had never done an official peer review of any article manuscript submitted to any journal. None of them had worked as a proper editorial assistant in any academic journal team previously. In other disciplinary domains, early career researchers cut their journal editing teeth by working first as junior members of the editorial collective of some journals. Later on, they are offered associate and eventually full editorial positions in those same or other journals. But here was our team, deciding to establish a new journal of Nepal Studies without such experience. Surely, we were well read in Nepali history and society, but collectively, we had minimal knowledge of the intricate processes that generate academic journals. Hence, the decision to establish SINHAS was a “foolish” reflection of the collective youth and naivety of the four founding editors.Portable lessonsGiven its current standing among practitioners of Nepal Studies, I would have to say that SINHAS has done pretty well in its 29 years of existence despite not having a “business plan.” We have learnt to run the journal while securing and editing good articles that enhance our collective understanding of Nepali history and society. That raises this question: Does every project in life need a business plan? I clearly don’t think so.

As analysed during his presidential campaign, we opined that his candidature was much stronger than that of other candidates. This was all the more evident during the second phase of his campaigning when the focus drew on his policy towards the Taliban. His distinct views (from Saeed Jalili’s, who lost the presidential election to Pezeshkian) divided the audience in the early second phase, influencing his supporters even more when the Taliban slid into the discussion from a meagre analogy.By the end of the second phase, many Iranians—especially from the Pezeshkian camp—had then considered Jalili to share ideological similarities with that of the Taliban. That being so, during our meeting with a political leader who served in the previous Rouhani government and advised Pezeshkian on foreign relations during the second phase of the presidential race, he vowed to prevent a Taliban-aligned administrator from forming the government. His statement not only reflected Jalili’s approach to the Taliban (if he became the administrator) but also severe apprehensions towards Iranian national security under his leadership. This statement can be interpreted in two ways: First, from a purely reformist perspective (emanating from the Pezeshkian camp), Jalili as an administrator was considered too extreme (even radical, according to some scholars), putting him in the same group as the Taliban with a desire to bring regional, perhaps even global instability. Though many in the Jalili camp disassociated these views, referring to them as meagre hearsay, some close to him and also those who voted for him discreetly acknowledged his views as ‘somewhat’ extreme. Second, the statement above also reflected Jalili’s intent to support the Taliban, perhaps establishing a functional relationship taking into account the Taliban’s 21-year campaign against the West—primarily the US—disregarding the threat posed by the group to Iranian national security, its territorial integrity/sovereignty or to local Iranians directly. Taking this discussion to Jalili’s camp, we spoke in great detail with political leaders and closest aides who described the Pezeshkian government ‘to be worse than that of Rouhani, risking regional instability in the first few months.’ Considering the aforementioned statements, we predict that the Pezeshkian administration will employ a different policy towards the Taliban government than that of the late former President Rouhani’s approach. Taking into account the nature of reformist governments, Pezeshkian’s administration may express little or no interest to support any radical/Islamic regime, particularly in the immediate neighbourhood, even if the entity is raising its flag against the West/US or their allies. With the Taliban echoed during the presidential race, it is highly likely for Pezeshkian to limit direct engagement with the group, at least during the first few months of his presidency. Similar reluctance appears to persist inside the Taliban’s Rahbari Shura, according to a Kabul-based journalist who engages with the Taliban’s MFA frequently. He opined on serious confusion and probable discontent with the Pezeshkian victory. Two Taliban leaders inside the Rahbari Shura expressed hope for strengthening and expanding relations between the two neighbours during the Pezeshkian administration, reflecting ambiguity and silence on the Taliban’s reservation over Pezeshkian’s victory. With the Rahbari Shura known to have closely monitored the outcome with great enthusiasm, Pezeshkian’s stance towards the group may have called for some reproachment in its policy towards Iran. This instigated profound dissatisfaction from a pragmatic neighbour with the possibility of even plunged ties with Tehran (during Pezeshkian’s presidency), reflecting severe mistrust weeks before his formal oath to power.That said, President-elect Pezeshkian can choose to adopt a different policy towards the Taliban, provided that his choice of cabinet receives blessings from the Supreme Leader. His cabinet will undergo serious vetting by the Office of the Supreme Leader or, to put it plainly, by Ali Khamenei himself. To understand the influence of the Supreme Leader, we spoke to a Tehran-based political leader who worked closely with the Late President Rouhani. He opined of a similar practice carried out by the late president, who, on one occasion, discussed the nomination of one particular political leader for a cabinet appointment with him, seeking the green light from the Supreme Leader himself. The statement above does not provide any substantial evidence to support the practice of seeking a green light from the Supreme Leader for the President’s cabinet. Indeed, it highlights the importance of seeking the Supreme Leader’s approval for matters of state. According to a Tehran-based expert, certain appointments explicitly call for a green light from the Office of the Supreme Leader. These include: Minister/public servants heading portfolios within domestic/foreign intelligence service, servants heading portfolios within the ministry of defence, servants heading portfolios within the ministry of interior and servants heading portfolios within the ministry of foreign affairs. Suppose the Pezeshkian administration decides to chart a course to re-establish a relationship with the West (it’s a big if); the bullwork would rest primarily on the cabinet member heading the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). As a set precedent, the Supreme Leader has always nominated the post of Foreign Minister to his preferred candidate, strengthening the ‘Axis of Resistance’ and synchronising the mandate of the MFA with that of the IRGC activities in the Middle East and beyond.As a principle, the foundation of Iran’s foreign policy can only be altered by the Supreme Leader, with IRGC providing strategic support to his decisions. According to one Tehran-based political leader, the responsibility of charting Iran’s Foreign Policy now rests with former nuclear negotiator Abbas Araqchi, the new Iran’s foreign minister. Even if, as a hypothesis, the President and his cabinet decide to alter Iran’s foreign policy in a positive direction, it will be forced to face the brunt of the IRGC.The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) can create serious hurdles for the Pezeshkian administration. It is a powerful force with the mandate of supporting ideologically aligned Islamic groups with a common goal of opposing the US and its allies. With the IRGC's growing engagement with the Taliban, particularly the GDI, it remains unclear how the Pezeshkian administration would put a check on the Guard Corp’s interaction with political leaders across the border. At this junction, it remains unclear if Pezeshkian’s administration could segregate strategic engagements from regional diplomacy with the intent to put a temporary stop to the IRGC's engagement with the Taliban.Only by successfully navigating the hurdles above does the Pezeshkian administration stand a chance of altering Iran’s Taliban policy since the latter came to power in 2021. If not, the Pezeshkian administration could retain the late President Rouhani’s policy towards the Taliban, which the Office of the Supreme Leader could emphasise. That said, even if the Supreme Leader does give the green light to an altered Taliban policy, expecting a substantial change would be hypothetical. It remains to be seen whether Pezeshkian will open doors of engagement based on realities in Tehran or Kabul or put forth the traditional stance of engaging with any Islamic group with hostilities against the US and its allies.Mishra is a visiting fellow at the International Centre for Policing and Security at the University of South Wales.

But Austin decided to rotate in the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier strike group to replace it.The Pentagon statement added it would increase readiness to deploy more land-based ballistic missile defenses.The US military also intensified deployments prior to April 13, when Iran launched an attack on Israeli territory with drones and missiles. Still, the threat from Hezbollah in Lebanon could present unique challenges to any efforts by the United States to intercept drones and missiles given the group’s vast arsenal and immediate proximity to Israel.At the time, Israel successfully knocked down almost all of the roughly 300 drones and missiles with the help of the United States and other allies.Biden, in a phone call on Thursday with Netanyahu, discussed new US defensive military deployments to support Israel against threats such as missiles and drones, the White House said.Iran and Hamas have both accused Israel of carrying out the killing and have pledged to retaliate against their foe. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the death nor denied it.Haniyeh’s death was one in a series of killings of senior Hamas figures as the war in Gaza between Hamas and Israel nears its 11th month and concern grows that the conflict is spreading across the Middle East.Earlier, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said the US did not believe escalation was inevitable.“I think we are being very direct in our messaging that certainly we don’t want to see heightened tensions and we do believe there is an off ramp here and that is that ceasefire deal,” Singh said.An Israeli delegation will travel to Cairo in coming days for negotiations to reach a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said on Friday.

This invisibility fuels misconceptions, with some dismissing the community’s issues as a “new foreign concept” seen only in younger generations.Although they have been largely invisible until recently, LGBTQIA+ older adults now constitute a significant and growing segment of the community. As Bhopali Chaudhary, 67, puts it, “We have always been there.” Despite progress in queer rights, many elderly members of the community in Nepal continue to face severe discrimination, neglect, and violence from their families and society, highlighting the urgent need for LGBTQIA+ friendly old age homes and housing solutions.Bhopali (name changed to protect her identity), who identifies as a third gender and prefers the pronouns ‘she/her’ has endured a lifetime of hardship. Born as a male in Saptari’s Sambhunath Municipality of Madhesh Province, Bhopali realised by age 13 that she felt more like a female. At 16, she was married to a woman, though her heart was drawn to men. For Bhopali, discrimination, hatred, jeers, and nasty comments were constants in her village, but she persevered and worked hard to support her family of two children and wife. However, when she became more open about her identity three years ago, things worsened. Her youngest son, addicted to cannabis and alcohol, began beating her. On November 3 last year, she sought help from her eldest son, only to be verbally abused and told to “stop acting like a woman.”The abuse culminated in a violent altercation that left Bhopali homeless. Desperate, she contemplated jumping into the Koshi River but was saved by her partner of fifteen years, a cisgendered pansexual male. A cisgendered pansexual male is a man who is attracted to people of any gender. Bhopali stayed with him temporarily for two months but had to leave due to societal pressures.With no other options, Bhopali reluctantly returned to her own home after her partner provided one quintal of rice and essentials to her sons. Yet, things didn’t improve. “One month after I returned, my wife became fully paralyzed. My sons left, refusing to take responsibility for their mother, leaving me to care for her and find ways to survive. I have no job and struggle to find work due to my identity. I don’t qualify for old age social security until I turn 68. My sons provide no support,” Bhopali shared.Although Bhopali now has a roof over her head, she fears being thrown out again, either by her sons or the landlord. Decades ago, her grandfather bought the land, but the land ownership certificate was not given, and now the seller’s descendants are threatening to evict her unless she pays the current price of the land.“I stay here for my wife. She was the only one who ever truly understood and supported me,” Bhopali said. She plans to move to an old age home after her wife’s death, but worries she might not be accepted there because of her identity.Bhopali isn’t alone in this. Her plight is shared by many elderly LGBTQIA+ individuals in Nepal. Sudha Chaudhary (name changed), 61, from Itahari of Koshi Province, faces similar challenges. Identifying as ‘meti’ (a term used in Nepal for third-gender or refers to a feminine presentation in a male body), Sudha has endured verbal and emotional abuse from her sons and daughters-in-law. To survive, Sudha, despite suffering from severe knee pain, travels to the Indian border town of Jogbani to carry clothes for Nepali retailers, who use individuals like her to transport goods from India in small amounts to avoid paying taxes. She also struggles to repay a loan of Rs600,000 taken for her youngest son’s marriage, with no support from her children.Even though she owns her house, Sudha wants to leave due to constant conflict and verbal abuse. “Everyday I feel like dying. If I fall sick, no one cares. I feel trapped in a house where I’m always told to stop behaving like a woman,” she says.Like Bhopali, she too, considers moving to old age homes, but fears facing the same abuse and discrimination. “My own children didn’t accept me. I’m afraid people there will hate me too”.Sudha dreams of living in a place like an old age home for people from her community. “I want to be myself, in a place where we can be safe.”She hopes the government and NGOs will address the needs of LGBTQIA+ elderly citizens who face abandonment, abuse, and a lack of safe, queer-friendly old age homes.For Sukmaya Magar, 55, from Chitwan’s Devghat, life took a tragic turn after her partner died in 2020 from jaundice and liver problems. As a lesbian woman, Sukmaya had shared both life and business with her partner for three decades. After her partner’s death, her partner’s elder sister claimed their shared property, which was solely in her partner’s name. “Without access to my partner’s bank account, I couldn’t get money for medical treatment when she was sick because I was only listed as a friend on the account. The bank required a family member,” Sukmaya recalls.Now, Sukmaya is left with only a small thatched house. She works in the fields to make a living, struggling with health issues, financial difficulties, and emotional exhaustion.“Since same-sex marriage wasn’t legally recognised, I had no claim to my partner’s property and am denied the single women’s allowance, unlike those in opposite-sex marriages,” Sukmaya adds.In November 2023, Nepal recognised same-sex marriage for the first time, but inconsistent bureaucracy makes it nearly impossible for most queer couples to marry. And issues like single women’s allowance for same-sex couples remain a far off problem, completely unaddressed.“I sought help from the municipality and other places for my rights but received none. I have lost everything,” Sukmaya says.The legal framework in Nepal, Article 160 of the Civil Code 2017 prohibits discrimination, with penalties of up to five years in prison or a fine of up to Rs50,000. The Senior Citizens Act 2006 protects seniors from being forced to live apart from their families and promotes the use of their skills and experiences to foster respect. However, these protections often fail to extend to elderly LGBTQIA+ individuals who face family rejection and societal prejudice.Mitini Nepal’s 2022 survey of 100 LGBTI+ individuals aged 50-75 across Nepal (excluding Karnali Province) found that 86 percent lacked access to state benefits like social security, medical insurance, or safe housing. Discrimination was prevalent as 65 percent felt unsafe due to lifelong experiences of bias, 23 percent were evicted because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, 27 percent faced workplace discrimination, 24 percent experienced physical harassment, and 31 percent encountered discrimination from family, community, and government officials.According to Bimala Gurung, programme officer at Mitini Nepal, the organisation, on March 27, submitted a memorandum to the then-minister for Women, Children, and Senior Citizens, Bhagwati Chaudhary, outlining the needs of elderly sexual and gender minorities.The memorandum recommended that the government adopt gender-sensitive measures, including creating gender-friendly infrastructure, spaces, and economic opportunities. It also called for mapping, data collection, and research on this community, as well as the development of safe, inclusive government housing and training for caregivers.“There have been no updates on the matter and now there is the new minister with the change in government. We’ve received numerous pleas for LGBTQIA+ elder housing but lack the budget to address this alone. We will continue to advocate to the government,” Gurung said.The plight of Bhopali, Sudha, and Sukmaya highlight the urgent need for inclusive policies and support systems. As Sudha puts it, “We are not asking for someone to feed us, we just want a safe shelter and opportunity to be ourselves, to live and earn with dignity.”Sukmaya says her partner died before they could legally marry, never seeing the day their union would be officially recognised. “Now, I fear dying alone and being left unburied. I hope for equal access to social security and LGBTQIA+-friendly old age homes so people like me can live together away from judgement and discrimination, with someone to care for in our final moments. It would bring comfort to share this progress with her in the afterlife,” she said.

She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina.

During the construction phase, infrastructure generates real cash flow for workers and their families. In the long run, it has a direct and indirect impact on the economy, with a multiplier effect, particularly in job creation.In Rupandehi, which hosts the industrial city Bhairahawa, and Lumbini, a landmark of the Buddhist world listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997, infrastructure built with a sizeable investment has gone to waste.Big infrastructure projects like the international convention centre, meditation centre, industrial zones, and Gautam Buddha International Airport have failed to generate income and have turned into veritable white elephants.Nature has started reclaiming most of the under-utilised infrastructure.Since 2010, talk of building an international airport led to the construction of large-scale infrastructure, including a bevy of luxury hotels.Proliferating factories and a rapidly spreading transport network turned the Butwal-Bhairahawa metroplex into an economic powerhouse.Nepal opened its second international airport in May 2022 in the southern city of Bhairahawa, but no international flight stops there right now.The objective of building an international airport in Bhairahawa was to bring in more tourists, energise businesses and create jobs. But the situation is just the opposite. Traders are closing down their shops and moving abroad for decent jobs.The private sector, too, invested heavily. When the finished project started to sit idle, it hit the sector, and many enterprises were teetering into bankruptcy.Economists term this development in Lumbini a cascading failure—a breakdown in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts leads to the failure of other parts. Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician and data curator at the National Statistics Office, said Lumbini province saw heavy investment from the government and the private sector, but the output has slowed. “Enterprises are unable to raise even the operating cost.”In the last fiscal year, Lumbini province was estimated to grow at 4.05 percent to a GDP of Rs814 billion, from the low base of the 1.99 percent growth it had achieved in the previous fiscal year. Lumbini is estimated to contribute 14.26 percent to the national GDP. The highest value-added growth rate in Lumbini was in electricity and gas, which grew by 28.93 percent, while the manufacturing sector was estimated to shrink by a negative 1.43 percent in the last fiscal year.Most completed infrastructures in Lumbini have become white elephants, as their expenditures have been growing instead of them generating income. The Butwal International Convention Center, built with an investment of Rs1.11 billion in ward 10 of Butwal Sub Metropolis, is currently without business. The centre has 13 halls, each with a capacity to accommodate 2,700 people. The auditorium is the largest of the 13.The government built the convention centre to organise national and international conferences and events, but it is not generating much income. Construction started in 2014 and the centre was inaugurated in August 2022.Officials say that the centre is struggling to pay its staff. While the centre is under-utilised and lacks maintenance, bushes have grown around it.Dharmendra Panthi, chief of the Butwal International Convention Center project, said 22 events or functions have been conducted in the past three years, earning Rs4 million. The centre is currently closed as the provincial cabinet is yet to pass the operating guidelines even in three years.However, Panthi said they have been occasionally renting the hall on request. The centre charges Rs96,000 for a day-long event.Prabin Pathak, president of the Nepal Hoteliers Association, who took part in a recent function at the convention centre, said the infrastructure is in a sorry state due to lack of periodic maintenance.“If the building is not utilised properly, it will be a waste of tax money,” said Pathak. “The washroom faucets are dry, and it is difficult to sit in the hall due to the stench from the washroom.”“In Nepal, there is a growing trend of building new infrastructure, but their upkeep is often ignored. This is sad,” Pathak said. “No one is accountable for the losses the projects incur. Similarly, questions are raised about the quality of construction. In most projects, low-quality materials are used, severely compromising the structural integrity.”A hall with a capacity to accommodate 5,000 people built near the Buddha’s birthplace, Lumbini, has yet to do any business, except hosting a few functions. It was built with an investment of Rs720 million.Sanuraja Shakya, member-secretary of the Lumbini Development Trust, said that if a social organisation wants to conduct a function at the centre, they have to pay a fee.Shakya said that since it is a meditation centre, they do not allow other functions, especially those involving entertainment.Questions were raised about the construction when the roof started leaking soon after project’s completion. It was repaired later.Likewise, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Bhairahawa, has not been fully operational for a long time. As factories have not been set up in the SEZ, the area has turned into a jungle. Construction of the SEZ had started in 2003 and it was inaugurated in 2014.Located in south-central Nepal, the Bhairahawa Special Economic Zone has 69 industrial plots of sizes from 1,400 to 3,700 square metres. A few industrialists have booked plots, but have not set up their plants as the government has failed to provide pledged services and amenities. The government had promised to provide 24-hour electricity, a one-stop service system, customs, banks, and insurance among other things inside the SEZ.“Every year, new entrepreneurs book plots, but do not set up their factories due to associated tough conditions,” said Saput Dumre, assistant director of SEZ. Dumre said industrialists are concerned about the mandatory export provision. According to SEZ guidelines, which were amended three months ago, firms that lease space inside the SEZ must export at least 30 percent of manufactured goods. “There is a water tank in the SEZ, but it has no water, the weighing machine does not work, the petrol pump is defunct, there are no parking areas, and the road is covered in thick bushes,” said Ujjwal Prasad Kasaju, a central member of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Then there is the new Gautam Buddha International Airport—all dressed up, and nowhere to go. The airport awaits applications for flight slots from international airlines after more than two years of opening.Nepal's second international airport was ready after ten years and nearly Rs40 billion pumped into the project, but despite the build-up, the expected rush of eager carriers is nowhere to be seen.The airport is a landmark located in south central Nepal and spread over 787 bighas (533 hectares).The modern facility has a 15,169-square-metre terminal building that can serve nearly a million passengers a year. The airport's 3,000-metre runway is long enough to handle the largest commercial jets. However, no commercial jet wants to fly to the airport.

While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesn’t just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. “They need options that won’t affect their income; a crackdown won’t work.”Dawadi emphasises that KMC shouldn’t view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure ‘disabled-friendly.’ Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. “People with disabilities should be involved in planning,” she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.“On many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,” he explains. “The footpath has become just a showpiece.”Rishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmandu’s footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministry’s Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMC’s recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishi’s organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.“The constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,” Adhikari said. “Forget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.”Rishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, “forcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.” This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.“Despite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,” Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. “This reflects a major failure of the state’s duty,” he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the country’s road infrastructure. “We don’t know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,” she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. “Without clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, it’s hard for us to find our destinations,” Ray says. “As I can’t hear, I rely on signs for guidance.”Ray also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. “Crossing the road can be chaotic,” he notes. “With drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.”Ray was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didn’t suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMC’s new footpaths and railings are a step forward but “they are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.”According to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term ‘disabled-friendly’ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an ‘inclusivity checklist’ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. “What about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?” he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. “There’s no guidance or facilities for us,” she said.Shrestha criticises the KMC’s approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. “Construction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,” he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. “While we’re committed to making footpaths accessible, we’re not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,” he said.“We’ve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we can’t address every issue alone.”Baburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. “We are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,” he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.“We’ve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmandu’s pavements and roads, but that doesn’t mean they’re not problematic,” Kumal says. “Accessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.” ","summary":"In Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions. While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking.

Nepal’s stock market responded positively to it, triggering a bull run and circuit breaks on Sunday’s trade, the first day of trading after the policy announcement. The Nepal Stock Exchange Index crossed the 2,700 mark after 29 months.The market seemed to have responded positively to the abolition of the Rs200 million ceiling to institutional investors in margin-type lending by the bank and financial institutions, an extension of the loan repayment period for the construction businesses by the end of December 2024, and provision for uncollateralised loans to those going for foreign employment, among others. These, indeed, are more reactive than well-thought-out sustainable policy responses that are unlikely to deliver desirable impacts on containing the severe recessionary trends faced by the economy.Monetary policy-makingFor decades now, Nepal’s monetary policy formulation has been a ritual orchestration rather than a substantive assertion of legally empowered independence by the NRB. The first compromise on monetary policy independence emanated from the fact that the Nepali currency is strictly pegged with the Indian currency. Pragmatically, the pluses of this arrangement may outweigh the minuses for the Nepali economy, so policymakers are not even considering discontinuing it.First, according to the universally acclaimed monetary theory of the impossible trinity, “a country can’t have a fixed exchange rate, independent monetary policy, and free capital movement all at once”. This means that no monetary policy can be ‘independent’ as long as it is pegged with any other currency. But we continue to embrace this impossibility.Second, the central bank shoulders three distinct responsibilities: Controlling inflation, ensuring financial sector stability through supervision and regulation, and, for all practical purposes, functioning as the government's key development finance agency. This reality has often obviated the NRB from an undivided focus on the 'core' central banking functions of money supply, inflation targeting and aversion to systemic risk.Third, the monetary authority and the monetary policy it brings out are often burdened with undue expectations beyond their jurisdiction and capacity. For example, a monetary policy is expected to come out with stimulus packages to ‘rescue’ the economy reeling down the recession, which could be appropriately addressed only by a bold and creative fiscal policy. The monetary policy can only complement this endeavour by managing financial resources for the same.Fourth and the saddest of all, the central bank is exhausting all its autonomy and energy in utterly un-innovative ritualisation of the tasks it should have shed decades ago. For instance, the directed lending policies in the name of the priority sector, deprived sector or the schemes aimed at financial inclusion should no longer be part of monetary policy since they may give rise to a conflict of interests between the roles of a regulator and concessional development financer. The most striking ambiguity of the sort is manifested in the NRB dilemma in dealing with microfinance institutions.The missesThe Monetary Policy appeared as if the central bank was unaware of the current economic malaise and the sources of recalcitrant stagnation. One major sector where the banks have over-invested in the past and suffocated at present is real estate. Except for raising the credit limit from 50 to 70 percent of the valuation to the homeowners with a ‘proven tax file’, the policy has left the land and housing entrepreneurs completely at bay. With India reducing duties on gold imports by 9 percent, as announced in the country’s annual budget last week, the gold market in Nepal, for better or worse, is going to be impacted differently. It will have a bearing on both investment and foreign exchange reserves. The new monetary policy grossly overlooks this phenomenon.Despite repeating a decade-old idea of setting up a second-tier oversight institution to regulate the saving and credit cooperatives and streamlining the operations of the microfinance institutions, the policy has blatantly failed to reinvigorate the small-and-medium-enterprise (SME) ecosystem. At present, the SMEs of Nepal face a grave crisis of legal/official recognition that has, in turn, impeded their access to formal financing mechanisms.The Economic Census of Nepal 2018 has shown that out of 923,356 establishments, only 462,605, or 50.1 percent, are registered. The rest—49.9 percent—have no legal identity. These are important entities providing self-employment and livelihood support to a large population. However, they have hardly any scope to find sizable investments and scale up their operations to enable them to reap the benefits of economies of scale. Again, it must not be misconstrued that the central bank should be directly involved in financing these SMEs. However, as a policy-maker, it should make functional arrangements by engaging relevant stakeholders like the subnational governments to facilitate and recognise grassroots businesses. This reflects the glaring gap in the public policymaking mindset that devolved financial power under federal polity can help optimise implementation, including monetary policy.Flimsy approachSome haphazard and over-ambitious policies have only eroded the central bank’s credibility as the regulator. A provision not to blacklist the contractors deliberately issuing bank checks without adequate balance in their accounts is in direct contravention of the best universal practices in banking.The monetary policy proposes to support the government in achieving an economic growth rate of 6 percent, as proposed by the budget of the current fiscal year, through liquidity management and credit disbursement towards the productive sector. It projects the broad money supply to be at 12.0 percent and credit disbursement to the private sector to grow at 12.5 percent. This means an increase of about Rs660 billion from the current Rs5.3 trillion disbursements of loans.The target is clearly to invest about Rs700 billion worth of loanable funds now lying idle in the system. This is a huge ask considering that during 11 months of the last fiscal year, loans from banks to the private sector increased only by 5.1 percent.The policy also fails to address the risk of alarmingly increasing non-performing assets in the banking system, making the banks more hesitant to invest aggressively. Such policy orchestration does not support the wider agenda of overdue structural reform of the financial system.  ","summary":"The Monetary Policy for Fiscal Year 2024-25 issued last Friday by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the monetary authority of Nepal, is generally hailed as expansionary.

Prime Minister Oli pledged a smooth transfer of power ‘to ensure political stability’, while giving instructions to government secretaries on Tuesday. Earlier, on Sunday, the prime minister had received ministerial briefings from the secretaries.Under the July 1 deal between the Congress and the UML, Oli, the UML chairman, became the prime minister on July 15 for a two-year term. As per the deal, he is expected to hand over the premiership to Sher Bahadur Deuba, the Congress chief, after this period. However, with concerns from coalition partners about whether Oli would honour this commitment, Prime Minister Oli on Tuesday said that he would resign a week before completing his two year-term.While speaking on the occasion of the 42nd BP Koirala Memorial Day on July 20, Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa had expressed doubts about whether Prime Minister Oli would smoothly hand over the prime ministership to the Congress.In response, Prime Minister Oli, while addressing government secretaries on Tuesday, pledged that the current coalition would ensure political stability. He urged them to work efficiently with a focus on results.“I will resign a week before completing my two-year term as prime minister,” Oli said. “After that, Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba will be the prime minister to ensure political stability.”“There is a confusion about the longevity of this government. I would like to clear the air. This government will not even crumble, let alone topple,” Oli said.When Prime Minister Oli was trying to ensure the stability of the government, there was a dramatic shakeup in the leadership of the bureaucracy on Monday. His Cabinet decided to reassign the responsibilities of 21 secretaries.However, Oli, while directing them on Tuesday, said that as the government was formed with the participation of two major parties at a crucial juncture in the country’s history, there is no room for failure. “When the earlier government failed to deliver, this one was formed with the backing of two major parties,” Oli said while directing the secretaries. “To address the frustration of people, the government should work efficiently and deliver results.”Oli also said that those receiving salaries from the government should not claim additional bonuses for attending meetings. Likewise, the prime minister stressed the need to complete ongoing projects rather than start new ones. He also asked them to work out a plan to save the millions of dollars spent on importing fossil fuel and emphasised the need for promoting hydropower. The prime minister also directed the secretaries to respond promptly to the grievances of the common people.The prime minister's directives to the secretaries were almost the same as those given by his predecessor. “With each new government, directing the secretaries has become a ritual,” Umesh Mainali, a former chief of the Public Service Commission, told the Post. “Instead of issuing directives, the government should be working to provide a more working environment for bureaucrats.”Reacting to Monday’s bureaucratic shake-up, Mainali said a mature leader seldom transfers secretaries without evaluating their performance. “If the present government was focused on results, it would not have transferred the secretaries of almost all ministries, right after receiving their briefings on Sunday,” added Mainali.Two secretaries who participated in the discussion with the prime minister, told the Post requesting anonymity that there is no dearth of such instructions from the head of government. “What the bureaucracy needs instead is confidence and favourable work conditions.”“Our colleagues often face corruption charges simply for following ministers’ instructions,” the secretaries told the Post. “Currently, there is no ministry that hasn’t received an inquiry letter from the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority.” ","summary":"Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, at least for now, appears resolute in his commitment to the government-formation agreement between his party, the CPN-UML, and the Nepali Congress.

The committee, which has members from both chambers of the federal parliament, was supposed to decide on Monday whether to accept his recommendation. Its meeting originally scheduled for the morning was postponed until the evening as cross-party lawmakers sought time for internal discussions on the matter.If the lawmakers’ claims are anything to go by, they were prepared to reject his nomination. Seeing his chances of getting the parliamentary committee’s approval evaporate, Pradhan wrote to the committee’s chairperson, informing that he wanted to withdraw his candidature. “Although my recommendation for the position was based on merit, I have no enthusiasm for executing the duties in the proposed position amid the organised smear campaign against me. I, therefore, withdraw my name from consideration for the post,” Pradhan said in the letter submitted to the parliament secretariat. Hours later, the House committee’s meeting rejected his nomination based on the same letter. “The committee has unanimously decided to reject Pradhan’s candidacy for election commissioner, as he is not willing to give continuity to his candidature,” said Pashupati Samsher Rana, the committee chairperson.On June 16, the Constitutional Council headed by the immediate past prime minister, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who also chairs the CPN (Maoist Centre) had unanimously nominated Pradhan for the position. Speaker Devraj Ghimire, National Assembly chair Narayan Dahal, Chief Justice Bishowambhar Prasad Shrestha, and Deputy Speaker Indira Rana approved the nomination without questions. Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, who was leader of the main opposition at the time, also gave his stamp of approval. However, the decision landed in controversy after a woman came forward accusing Pradhan of sexually exploiting her for five years. She not only filed a complaint but also appeared before the House panel with ‘evidence’ to back her accusation.The victim had presented the evidence of her complaints and court documents showing that the case was settled, along with an audio record demonstrating how she was exploited. Appearing before the committee, she claimed that Pradhan used his influence to prevent her from filing complaints with the police. She claimed that Pradhan sexually exploited her in his office and other places continuously from 2018 until last year. The issue was settled in Kathmandu District Court after Pradhan paid over Rs10 million in cash. The victim has accused Pradhan of using his power to reach this settlement. “I filed the complaint [with the committee] to stop such a morally corrupt person from taking a constitutional position. How can you approve his nomination?” she questioned the lawmakers on the committee.On Wednesday, the panel, after a long hiatus, quizzed Pradhan seeking his clarification over the allegation. During the hearing, cross-party lawmakers grilled Pradhan on how he would address the serious allegations of sexual violence and questioned his moral integrity. Most members of the 15-strong committee had asked him as to how he was eligible to hold the constitutional position given the grave allegations.In defence, Pradhan said that the issue was settled in court, and both the sides—he and the woman—had agreed not to raise it further. He had claimed that he was unnecessarily being dragged into controversy. There was widespread pressure on the parliamentary committee to reject his nomination. This is the second instance of a nominee for a constitutional position being rejected since the start of the parliamentary hearing process. In August 2018, the hearing committee rejected Deepak Raj Joshi's nomination as Chief Justice. However, the decision to reject Pradhan was taken only after he had withdrawn his candidacy.A two-thirds majority of the 15-strong committee, which has lawmakers from both chambers of Parliament, can reject the nomination.Experts on parliamentary affairs say over the years, the hearing panel has become a rubber stamp for top leadership. Yet it is a platform where complaints can be lodged, which helps create public debate. “The media and the civil society took up the issue based on complaints filed at the committee. I don’t believe these lawmakers would have dared to reject the nomination if there was no such pressure,” said Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat. Pradhan, who has been the executive director of the Nepal Law Society for over two decades, reportedly maintains a good rapport with political and judicial leaderships. ","summary":"The Parliamentary Hearing Committee on Monday rejected Krishna Man Pradhan’s nomination as an election commissioner hours after he decided to withdraw from the race.A meeting of the committee unanimously reached the decision, saying Pradhan himself had recused himself from the hearing process. The committee, which has members from both chambers of the federal parliament, was supposed to decide on Monday whether to accept his recommendation. Its meeting originally scheduled for the morning was postponed until the evening as cross-party lawmakers sought time for internal discussions on the matter.If the lawmakers’ claims are anything to go by, they were prepared to reject his nomination. Seeing his chances of getting the parliamentary committee’s approval evaporate, Pradhan wrote to the committee’s chairperson, informing that he wanted to withdraw his candidature. “Although my recommendation for the position was based on merit, I have no enthusiasm for executing the duties in the proposed position amid the organised smear campaign against me. I, therefore, withdraw my name from consideration for the post,” Pradhan said in the letter submitted to the parliament secretariat. Hours later, the House committee’s meeting rejected his nomination based on the same letter. “The committee has unanimously decided to reject Pradhan’s candidacy for election commissioner, as he is not willing to give continuity to his candidature,” said Pashupati Samsher Rana, the committee chairperson.On June 16, the Constitutional Council headed by the immediate past prime minister, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who also chairs the CPN (Maoist Centre) had unanimously nominated Pradhan for the position. Speaker Devraj Ghimire, National Assembly chair Narayan Dahal, Chief Justice Bishowambhar Prasad Shrestha, and Deputy Speaker Indira Rana approved the nomination without questions. Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, who was leader of the main opposition at the time, also gave his stamp of approval. However, the decision landed in controversy after a woman came forward accusing Pradhan of sexually exploiting her for five years. She not only filed a complaint but also appeared before the House panel with ‘evidence’ to back her accusation.The victim had presented the evidence of her complaints and court documents showing that the case was settled, along with an audio record demonstrating how she was exploited. Appearing before the committee, she claimed that Pradhan used his influence to prevent her from filing complaints with the police. She claimed that Pradhan sexually exploited her in his office and other places continuously from 2018 until last year. The issue was settled in Kathmandu District Court after Pradhan paid over Rs10 million in cash. The victim has accused Pradhan of using his power to reach this settlement. “I filed the complaint [with the committee] to stop such a morally corrupt person from taking a constitutional position. How can you approve his nomination?” she questioned the lawmakers on the committee.On Wednesday, the panel, after a long hiatus, quizzed Pradhan seeking his clarification over the allegation. During the hearing, cross-party lawmakers grilled Pradhan on how he would address the serious allegations of sexual violence and questioned his moral integrity. Most members of the 15-strong committee had asked him as to how he was eligible to hold the constitutional position given the grave allegations.In defence, Pradhan said that the issue was settled in court, and both the sides—he and the woman—had agreed not to raise it further. He had claimed that he was unnecessarily being dragged into controversy. There was widespread pressure on the parliamentary committee to reject his nomination. This is the second instance of a nominee for a constitutional position being rejected since the start of the parliamentary hearing process.

The work started in the New Road area in May, but a jurisdictional dispute between the city office and the Road Division, Kathmandu, caused the project to come to a halt. The division confiscated contractors’ equipment, and the federal government deployed police in to prevent the city office from working. Some local residents, too, had demonstrated against the pavement widening plan. The division had even repaired the parts of roads cut for pavement expansion.And on June 9, the metropolis moved the High Court challenging the breach of jurisdiction by the road division, which is a federal agency, and its intervention in the city’s work.City officials were already frustrated by the years-long delay by federal agencies in completing another project, the widening of Kathmandu’s Ring Road in the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section, which has caused huge inconvenience to the public due to dust and mud.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed city officials to dump truckloads of dirt from the Ring Road section in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office at Minbhawan, accusing federal agencies of delaying the work.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years due to Covid and delays in clearing the power poles and in some cases structures along the right of way.Regarding the jurisdiction dispute over the sidewalk widening work in the city, a division bench of judges Dhurba Raj Nand and Prakash Kharel at the High Court Patan issued an interim order in favour of the metropolis on Sunday.The City office has already widening pavements by 1 metre on both sides in the Bhrikutimandap area. “Neither did the federal government agency intervene, nor did locals object while expanding pavement in the Bhrikutimandap area by narrowing the road,” said Bhattarai. “Further decisions on pavement widening in other areas like Thamel, Handigaun and others will be taken after collecting public feedback.”Officials said that the long-term plan is to restrict motor vehicles altogether in the New Road area due to heavy pedestrian traffic. “We have also been working to find a solution to the parking problem and weighing various options including setting up multi-storey parking facilities,” said Bhattarai, who is also an urban planner.Officials said that pavements in the New Road area, which always remain crowded, should be widened to ensure free pedestrian movement.

Officials said the move aims to ensure smooth transfer of waste as roads to the landfill often become impassable during the monsoon, preventing the passage of garbage trucks.“We have deployed three excavators, two bulldozers and two loaders to clear landslide debris along the road to the Bancharedanda landfill,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. “Also, we have kept five more vehicles on standby for immediate deployment if needed.”Every year, during monsoon season, the road to landfill sites gets obstructed in multiple places, obstructing the transfer of house waste collected in the three districts of the capital city—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Apart from these, some local levels of Kavrepalanchok also discard garbage at the landfill site at Bancharedanda.The metropolis officials said that they had purchased 10 high-pressure pumps to drain floodwaters from inundated settlements.“Five pumps have already been sent to the high-risk areas along riversides,” said Shrestha. “These can quickly pump away floodwaters.”The city office started repairing the Sisdole road leading to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district just a few weeks before the start of the monsoon. Officials said Rs30 million had been allocated for repairs, which included fixing potholes, concreting roads, and other works.Around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised, according to officials.Besides monsoon-induced road obstructions, garbage disposal is sometimes disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions cause weeks-long halt to door-to-door garbage collection, leading people in the Valley to discard their trash on streets.Officials said that a high-pressure pump is being used to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground.Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The City office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.The city office recently sold non-degradable waste worth Rs700,000.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled.

Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.“Every Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,” said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. “Decisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight.

But they also bring some good news. Nepal has recorded one of the fastest paddy transplantation rates in many decades, courtesy of “above-normal rainfall”.According to the Department of Agriculture, the paddy transplantation rate reached 96 percent as of Wednesday. “Though details have yet to come, based on our inquiry, transplantation has been completed on 96 percent of the paddy fields,” said Arun Kafle, deputy director general of the department.He said Nepali farmers have been transplanting summer paddy at a rapid pace due to abundant rainfall, raising the prospect of a bumper harvest.This is believed to be the fastest transplantation rate in many decades. “Rainfall has been consistent, which is a boon for the crops, particularly paddy.”Agro experts say that due to the regular and abundant monsoon rains, the Madhesh province has surpassed Koshi province, its neighbour, in terms of paddy transplantation for the first time, which also surpassed the national average. Insufficient rainfall has long been a recurrent problem in the Madhesh province. A massive outflow of youths to foreign lands, creating a shortage of labourers to carry out agricultural activities, has added to the difficulties of local farmers.Agro experts say that transplanting dates differ from region to region.Early transplantation has some advantages. Agro economists say that early transplanted paddy mostly escapes pest attack, thereby reducing the additional cost of inputs in terms of pesticide application.Besides, it eases the next cycle of crops on the same field in a timely manner.“The most important part of early transplantation is that it increases the paddy areas,” said agro expert Rajendra Uprety, who is also the executive director at AgriGreen Nepal. “After transplantation, the next one-month period is critical for plant growth. If the rainfall is regular during the growth period, production will rise.”He said that in a few areas of eastern Nepal, a nutrition deficit has been observed due to the overuse of urea. Excessive urea use can easily damage other fertilisers and cause a nutrition deficit.“As urea is cheap, farmers use it without balancing it with other nutrients like potash and compost. This tendency has led to serious problems in many areas of Nepal.”In Nepal, the transplantation dates differ according to the availability of rainfall and geography. In the upper hills, paddy transplantation is completed by mid-June. In Tarai, the country’s food basket, it begins in early July and extends to early September, depending on water availability.The plains account for 71 percent of the total rice acreage. The hills account for 25 percent, and the mountain region 4 percent.Last year, low rainfall delayed transplantation in Madhesh Province, affecting production and productivity.According to the Department of Agriculture, the process had been completed on 92.4 percent of the 1.39 million hectares of land available for paddy cultivation as of Sunday.Paddy transplantation was at 78 percent in the same period last year. This year, the monsoon entered Nepal from the east on June 10, three days ahead of its usual onset date, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division.Nepal’s economic well-being is closely tied to the rainy season. Rainwater is the lifeblood of Nepal's Rs5.7 trillion economy, which relies heavily on agriculture. Nearly two-thirds of the farmlands are rain-fed.During the four months from June to September, a large part of the country receives nearly 80 percent of its annual rainfall.The production of food grains, mainly rice, depends on the amount and distribution of monsoon rain over the country. The rains also replenish groundwater and reservoirs critical for drinking and power generation.According to the department, Madhesh Province had the lowest transplantation rate, at 58.8 percent, last year. This accelerated to 92 percent this year. Madhesh, which commands the lion’s share of the paddy fields (383,150 hectares), has completed transplantation on 352,443 hectares as of Wednesday. “The growth in productivity in Madhesh raises the overall national production. So, if the rainfall continues and there is no fertiliser shortage, Nepal could see a bumper paddy harvest this year,” said Kafle. Paddy is harvested from mid-October to November. Sudurpaschim Province saw the highest transplantation rate, at 99.6 percent of its 174,576 hectares, followed by Karnali Province, with 96.9 percent of its 41,904 hectares, Madhesh Province, with 92 percent, and Gandaki Province’s 91.9 percent of 96,053 hectares.The rate in Lumbini province has been recorded at 91.3 percent of 311,643 hectares. In Bagmati Province, transplantation is complete on 90.8 percent of its 112,273 hectares. The Koshi province saw the lowest transplantation rate of 90.7 percent of 276,386 hectares. Paddy is Nepal’s biggest earning farm commodity, with tens of thousands of farmers relying on its income. According to economists, the high output may cool down inflation and pump up the economy.

Insufficient rainfall has long been a recurrent problem in the Madhesh province. A massive outflow of youths to foreign lands, creating a shortage of labourers to carry out agricultural activities, has added to the difficulties of local farmers.Agro experts say that transplanting dates differ from region to region.Early transplantation has some advantages. Agro economists say that early transplanted paddy mostly escapes pest attack, thereby reducing the additional cost of inputs in terms of pesticide application.Besides, it eases the next cycle of crops on the same field in a timely manner.“The most important part of early transplantation is that it increases the paddy areas,” said agro expert Rajendra Uprety, who is also the executive director at AgriGreen Nepal. “After transplantation, the next one-month period is critical for plant growth. If the rainfall is regular during the growth period, production will rise.”He said that in a few areas of eastern Nepal, a nutrition deficit has been observed due to the overuse of urea. Excessive urea use can easily damage other fertilisers and cause a nutrition deficit.“As urea is cheap, farmers use it without balancing it with other nutrients like potash and compost. This tendency has led to serious problems in many areas of Nepal.”In Nepal, the transplantation dates differ according to the availability of rainfall and geography. In the upper hills, paddy transplantation is completed by mid-June. In Tarai, the country’s food basket, it begins in early July and extends to early September, depending on water availability.The plains account for 71 percent of the total rice acreage. The hills account for 25 percent, and the mountain region 4 percent.Last year, low rainfall delayed transplantation in Madhesh Province, affecting production and productivity.According to the Department of Agriculture, the process had been completed on 92.4 percent of the 1.39 million hectares of land available for paddy cultivation as of Sunday.Paddy transplantation was at 78 percent in the same period last year. This year, the monsoon entered Nepal from the east on June 10, three days ahead of its usual onset date, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division.Nepal’s economic well-being is closely tied to the rainy season. Rainwater is the lifeblood of Nepal's Rs5.7 trillion economy, which relies heavily on agriculture. Nearly two-thirds of the farmlands are rain-fed.During the four months from June to September, a large part of the country receives nearly 80 percent of its annual rainfall.The production of food grains, mainly rice, depends on the amount and distribution of monsoon rain over the country. The rains also replenish groundwater and reservoirs critical for drinking and power generation.According to the department, Madhesh Province had the lowest transplantation rate, at 58.8 percent, last year. This accelerated to 92 percent this year. Madhesh, which commands the lion’s share of the paddy fields (383,150 hectares), has completed transplantation on 352,443 hectares as of Wednesday. “The growth in productivity in Madhesh raises the overall national production. So, if the rainfall continues and there is no fertiliser shortage, Nepal could see a bumper paddy harvest this year,” said Kafle. Paddy is harvested from mid-October to November. Sudurpaschim Province saw the highest transplantation rate, at 99.6 percent of its 174,576 hectares, followed by Karnali Province, with 96.9 percent of its 41,904 hectares, Madhesh Province, with 92 percent, and Gandaki Province’s 91.9 percent of 96,053 hectares.The rate in Lumbini province has been recorded at 91.3 percent of 311,643 hectares. In Bagmati Province, transplantation is complete on 90.8 percent of its 112,273 hectares. The Koshi province saw the lowest transplantation rate of 90.7 percent of 276,386 hectares. Paddy is Nepal’s biggest earning farm commodity, with tens of thousands of farmers relying on its income. According to economists, the high output may cool down inflation and pump up the economy.

People residing in other districts may have also been infected with the deadly disease, but due to absence of an active cholera surveillance programme in most of the districts, no one knows what is going on.“Active cholera surveillance is being carried out only in the three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur—and in Kailali,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have a system in place in other districts as well but intensive surveillance is being carried out in Kathmandu Valley and in Kailali only.”Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. They concede that the outbreaks of the deadly disease are being reported from the districts having active case surveillance programmes. Active cholera surveillance is being carried out from 27 health facilities in the Valley and 10 in Kailali district.“Report of cholera outbreak in districts having intensive cholera surveillance is an obvious thing, as we carry out testing only when we find problems,” said an official at the Department of Health Services, asking not to be named as he is not authorised to talk to the media. “We will not know anything about the cause of disease outbreaks, if we stopped testing.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population, however, claimed that even if active cholera surveillance programmes are not in place in most of the districts, systems are in place to collect stool samples of the diarrhoeal patients and send them for lab testing if needed.“We have provincial public health laboratories in all provinces that can carry out cholera testing, and we also bring samples to the National Public Health Laboratory for examination when a massive diarrheal outbreak occurs,” said Ojha of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have an Integrated Health Information Management System and Early Warning, Alert and Response System, which reports about the disease outbreaks. Active surveillance is being carried out only in high risk districts.”Officials, who wish not to be quoted in news as they fear retribution for speaking to the media, however, said that Integrated Health Information Management System only provides monthly reports; moreover, the system provides only clinical reports, not the reports of lab testing. The Early Warning, Alert and Response System is also not very effective.“The thing is systems on which health authorities rely much do not give an exact picture of the disease outbreak, and such systems do not help contain massive outbreaks,” the official said. “Major outbreaks of waterborne disease could happen at any time and at any place, and authorities concerned get alerted only after loss.”Health officials concede that it is not the government that is carrying out active surveillance of the deadly disease in four districts but the International Vaccine Institute, Korea. When asked why the government does not think it necessary to carry out active cholera surveillance in other districts, they said that the existing health budget is insufficient for the task.Cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season are not a new thing in Nepal, as hundreds of people throughout the country suffer from diarrhoeal infections that continue for months every year and scores contract the disease.In 2022, a total of 77 cholera cases were confirmed in the Valley.

Providing healthcare programmes to these groups is always a challenge. Chances of children missing vaccination or other health campaigns is always high in big and crowded cities like in the Kathmandu Valley.”Health authorities launched a special immunisation programme in the three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur and in Bhaktapur—following the detection of a highly contagious poliovirus in sewage samples.Officials say that presence of type-3 poliovirus in sewage samples has been confirmed by the National Institute of Health of Thailand, a World Health Organisation’s collaborating centre. The virus, which originated from a vaccine, was detected in sewage samples collected from the confluence of the Tukucha and Bagmati Rivers [in Kathmandu] on May 26, according to them.Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but was officially declared polio-free by the World Health Organisation only on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After having zero human cases of polio for about 14 years, the infectious disease has surfaced in the capital city’s sewage, which is a serious problem, according to public health officials. They said that the presence of poliovirus in sewage samples indicates the looming risk of an outbreak.The Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services had planned to carry out a four-day polio vaccination in all three districts of the Valley from July 24 but later extended for a week.All children under five years of age have been inoculated with an additional dose of oral polio vaccine in the drive.Oral polio vaccine, which consists of Type-1 and Type-3 polioviruses have been administered during the campaign. Health workers and female community health volunteers were deployed to homes, schools, bus parks, and entry points to ensure that no eligible children miss the vaccine. “We found over 3,000 children living in city slums,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section. “We are aware that children might still miss the vaccine despite our best efforts to meet the target.”The health ministry said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country. An estimated 300,000 children live in three districts of the Valley. But the 104 percent coverage rate shows that more children reside in the Valley than estimated. Health authorities do not have exact data on the people residing in the city slums. Floating population, scattered slums, high density of working-class people, and lack of awareness and poor access to health services are some of the challenges identified in improving health indicators, experts say. They urge the authorities to focus on high-risk groups when designing health programs, as vulnerable populations are always disproportionately affected during disease outbreaks.Doctors say the poliovirus mainly affects children and is usually transmitted through droplets or aerosols from the throat and by faecal contamination of hands, utensils, food and water. Those who do not wash their hands properly, and those who consume contaminated food and water or reside in an area where water and sanitation conditions are poor are at high risk of getting infected with the virus.Experts urge health authorities to carry out post-campaign surveys to know the actual coverage of the campaign.“Achieving 104 percent coverage is more of an administrative number,” said Upreti, former director general, who is also a child health expert. “Health authorities must carry out a post-campaign survey to reveal the true picture.”Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, boasting a high coverage rate.

Officials at the Health Office Kathmandu said that the National Public Health Laboratory, which carried out testing on stool samples of diarrheal patients, confirmed cholera infection on Monday evening.“Reports from the laboratory confirmed cholera outbreaks in additional three places in the Valley, including two areas in Kathmandu,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of Health Office Kathmandu. “Earlier rapid diagnostic tests too had shown cholera infection in those patients.” With these additional cases, the total number of diarrheal patients testing positive for cholera across the country has reached 16 within a week. Last week, cholera outbreaks were reported in Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur district and Dhangadhi Sub-metropolitan City of Kailali district.At least 13 people—seven in Godawari Municipality and six in Dhangadhi Sub-metropolis tested positive for cholera, according to officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient. Health officials concede that the outbreak of the deadly disease in several places at once shows that the cholera has spread to multiple locations of the Valley.According to Officials at the Health Office Kathmandu, the infected patients have been admitted at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital and Chabahil-based Helping Hands Community Hospital. Following news of the suspected cholera outbreak, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, along with Health Office Kathmandu and the local units, which are responsible for responding to the disease outbreaks, scrambled to contain the spread of the infection.“Contaminated water is the main culprit behind the cholera outbreaks in Lalitpur and Kailali,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the division. “Various programmes including water and sanitation initiatives, and awareness campaigns, are being organised in the affected areas.”The Kathmandu Valley often witnesses cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season, with hundreds of people suffering from diarrheal infections that continue for months. Public health experts say that due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, the country as a whole is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.This year too, major hospitals in Kathmandu Valley have been grappling with a surge in cases of water-borne diseases including severe diarrhoea. “Fifteen to 20 diarrheal patients have been seeking care in our emergency department every day,” said Dr Ravi Shakya, director at the Patan Hospital. In 2022, a total of 77 cases of cholera were confirmed in the Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in wards 11, 12, and 13 of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, which were highly affected by the outbreak. Public health experts said that sheer negligence from parts of authorities concerned is responsible for ongoing outbreak of diarrheal disease including deadly cholera. Health authorities in most local units had stopped testing of drinking water just before the start of the monsoon season citing lack of funds, although deadly microbes such as faecal coliform and E coli were frequently detected in drinking water samples.Faecal coliform and E coli, both microscopic organisms, are found in human faeces. According to doctors, their presence of faecal coliform and E coli in drinking water means it is contaminated with sewage.“Ensuring water quality is a regular job and basic duty of the relevant agency,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Hospital. “Such essential services should not be halted under any conditions.”Doctors say bottled water is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley and is generally considered safe, but water quality of several companies have been found questionable. Presence of dangerous microbes in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.A combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors.The World Health Organisation also said that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. ","summary":"At least three diarrheal patients— one from Kalimati in Kathmandu Metropolitan City, one from Tokha Municipality, and another from Gwarko of Lalitpur district—have tested positive for cholera. Officials at the Health Office Kathmandu said that the National Public Health Laboratory, which carried out testing on stool samples of diarrheal patients, confirmed cholera infection on Monday evening.“Reports from the laboratory confirmed cholera outbreaks in additional three places in the Valley, including two areas in Kathmandu,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of Health Office Kathmandu. “Earlier rapid diagnostic tests too had shown cholera infection in those patients.” With these additional cases, the total number of diarrheal patients testing positive for cholera across the country has reached 16 within a week. Last week, cholera outbreaks were reported in Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur district and Dhangadhi Sub-metropolitan City of Kailali district.At least 13 people—seven in Godawari Municipality and six in Dhangadhi Sub-metropolis tested positive for cholera, according to officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient. Health officials concede that the outbreak of the deadly disease in several places at once shows that the cholera has spread to multiple locations of the Valley.According to Officials at the Health Office Kathmandu, the infected patients have been admitted at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital and Chabahil-based Helping Hands Community Hospital. Following news of the suspected cholera outbreak, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, along with Health Office Kathmandu and the local units, which are responsible for responding to the disease outbreaks, scrambled to contain the spread of the infection.“Contaminated water is the main culprit behind the cholera outbreaks in Lalitpur and Kailali,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the division. “Various programmes including water and sanitation initiatives, and awareness campaigns, are being organised in the affected areas.”The Kathmandu Valley often witnesses cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season, with hundreds of people suffering from diarrheal infections that continue for months. Public health experts say that due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, the country as a whole is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.This year too, major hospitals in Kathmandu Valley have been grappling with a surge in cases of water-borne diseases including severe diarrhoea. “Fifteen to 20 diarrheal patients have been seeking care in our emergency department every day,” said Dr Ravi Shakya, director at the Patan Hospital. In 2022, a total of 77 cases of cholera were confirmed in the Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in wards 11, 12, and 13 of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, which were highly affected by the outbreak. Public health experts said that sheer negligence from parts of authorities concerned is responsible for ongoing outbreak of diarrheal disease including deadly cholera. Health authorities in most local units had stopped testing of drinking water just before the start of the monsoon season citing lack of funds, although deadly microbes such as faecal coliform and E coli were frequently detected in drinking water samples.Faecal coliform and E coli, both microscopic organisms, are found in human faeces.

Ekata Vyas, who campaigns on behalf of the Nepali students—estimated to number at least 60—told the Post that she is hoping for positive results this time. She has received positive feedback and responses from New Delhi and the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu. The monthly stipend ranges from IRs 90,000 to 1,20,000.Besides taking up the matter, the foreign national doctors, mostly from Nepal, took up the issue before 2011. According to the Nepali doctors who are serving in AIIMS, a case was filed in the Delhi High Court against the discriminatory provision over the stipends and arrears in 2011. The Delhi Court gave its verdict in favour of the students on July 16. In 2013, however, the AIIMS filed a counter case which was made absolute on December 4, 2017, after 27 hearings, most of them just formalities marked by absences on the bench and of defendants. A Nepali student said that since they did not have the time and resources to follow up on the case in court, it was dismissed. “Then, we started discussing the matter with government officials and diplomats,” said the student.During the Nepal visit of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi in 2018, then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli also took up the matter with the Indian delegation.“Then we came to know that the India prime minister's office directed the Ministry of External Affairs to look into the matter and expedite its resolution. The Indian Embassy in Kathmandu also confirmed to India’s Ministry of External Affairs that Indian students in similar courses are getting stipends equal to their Nepali counterparts from their respective institutions in Nepal. In May 2018, India’s Ministry of External Affairs wrote to the Ministry of Health and Family Affairs to examine and expedite the prime minister’s directive.Then, India’s health ministry wrote to AIIMS, the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JPIMER), and the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, seeking the details of the foreign national residents.“It is pertinent to note that esteemed institutions such as JIPMER and PGIMER have already rectified similar issues by ensuring stipend payments to their Foreign National Residents as early as 2020. AIIMS, renowned for its commitment to excellence and equity, cannot afford to lag behind in such matters of principle. As representatives of the RDA, we assert that the workload and dedication of Foreign National Residents are equivalent to their peers who receive stipends,” the RDA stated in its letter to the AIIMS director.After two premier health institutions started providing the stipends in April 2020, the Resident Doctors Association of AIIMS wrote to the Prime Minister's Office in India seeking its intervention and solidarity with the foreign national residents who have been deprived of the stipends for the past decade.Again in May of the same year, the AIIMS association wrote to the AIIMS director to recognise the efforts by foreign national residents during the pandemic and consider resuming the stipend, but the request went unheard.In January 2023, the AIIMS issued a public notice stating that the government of Nepal should sponsor these students.Nepal’s foreign ministry then clarified that the Nepali students had competed openly and were selected on merit with no sponsorship or role of the government of Nepal. It directed the Nepali Embassy in New Delhi to look into the matter. “We took up the issue with prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and urged him to raise the matter while meeting with Modi,” said the Nepali doctors. “In September, 2023, the Supreme Court of India issued a verdict in a similar case stating that nonpayment of stipend cannot be justified.”Arguing that it is equivalent to bonded labour, the verdict directed the Medical Council to take note of instances in which the stipend is not paid.The Indian government informed the Supreme Court of India that, as per its directive, action will be taken to ensure that there is parity in medical education. “We again wrote to the foreign minister of Nepal, the Nepali Embassy, and the Indian Embassy to discuss the matter during the bilateral commission meeting scheduled for the first week of January 2024,” a Nepali doctor said.Both foreign minister NP Saud and Nepal’s ambassador Shankar Sharma took up the matter during the seventh joint commission meeting held in Kathmandu, according to the students.Then, several meetings were held, correspondence was made by the resident doctors of AIIMS, and Nepali students submitted applications to the health minister of India, people informed on the matter said.\"RDA asserts that the workload and dedication of foreign national residents are equivalent to their peers who receive stipends,\" said RDA President Dr Inder Shekhar Prasad. \"Denial of their stipends not only undermines their morale but also tarnishes AIIMS's reputation as a beacon of medical education and equality.\"The Nepali doctors said that since India has come up with a new budget, they hope their long struggle for getting stipends will be resolved.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve ","summary":"Nepali chef Aditya Mishra, founder of New York supper club \"The Sewing Tin,\" promotes Nepali cuisine globally through innovative fusion dishes, aiming to elevate its prominence and share its unique flavors with the world."},{"hash":"4f18229de2a5d8016e8888758de34cc858e98af2b542ed3077fa8ab2d1e49a3b","title":"**Patience, passion, and pastries:**\n\n- Success takes time and effort (patience).\n- Find something you love to do (passion).\n- Enjoy the process (pastries).","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/recipes/2024/04/27/patience-passion-and-pastries","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/BakeleusbyCeleus-1714186343.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1714176000000,"source":"kp","category":"recipes","content":"**Celeus Baral: A Passionate Baker**\n\nCeleus Baral is a skilled baker who runs an online shop called Bakeleus.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities.

It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects.

Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation.

Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution.

Local Asianet TV said more than 300 had been killed.Two men and two women were found alive by the army in a marooned, remote area on Friday, V T Mathew, a top army commander, said.“They were not buried, they were just in a remote area,” he told Reuters, adding that one of them was injured.Rescue efforts were hampered initially after Mundakkai, the worst affected area, was cut off from the nearest town of Chooralmala as the main bridge connecting them was washed away.Heavy vehicles had begun to ply on the 190-foot (58-metre) bridge constructed by army engineers, and drones with earth-sensing technology to find bodies buried in mud are being brought in, the army said in a statement.Although there were fewer rescue workers and volunteers at the site on Friday, the effort gathered pace as it became easier to access the worst-affected region.Before the bridge was completed, workers and volunteers hiked several miles by foot, carrying bodies and sending food to personnel working there.Rescue workers also focused on a riverbank near Vellarmala village, about three miles from Mundakkai, where 58 bodies had been found earlier, the most from one spot.“This area doesn’t have a lot of population.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. ","summary":"What animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) ","summary":"Nepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original.

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

Clashes with police and Chhatra League—the student front of the ruling Awami League (AL)—and the ruling party, which started on July 15, took an ugly turn by the 19th, resulting in nearly more than 200 deaths and hundreds of injuries.Curfews were imposed, shoot-at-sight was ordered, and the internet was shut down to contain the protest and violence as right-wing groups and the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) tried to take advantage of the deep resentment the movement built. The quota reform movement soon took a political turn against Hasina. The students have been staging protests since the High Court Bench of the Supreme Court’s verdict on July 5 declared the 2018 circular that did away with freedom fighters’ children quota in the class I and II government jobs as void. The students demanded quota reform and wanted the government to legislate rather than issue a circular. Such protests against the freedom fighters’ children quota are not new. Students are aggrieved that 56 percent of government jobs are still reserved, leaving only a few positions for merit-based selection. Introduction of quotaThe Bangladesh government in November 1972 reserved 30 percent of government jobs for those who fought in the 1971 Liberation War, 10 percent for women affected by the war, 40 percent for districts lagging behind and only 20 percent for meritorious candidates. The quota system was amended in 1985 to allow 45 percent of jobs on merit while reserving 55 percent. Since 10 percent set aside for women affected by war remained unclaimed, it was extended to women in general. For the first time, 5 percent of jobs were reserved for the indigenous community, and the district quota was reduced to 10 percent. In 2010, the government extended a 30 percent quota to the grandchildren of freedom fighters. It stated that the reserved positions would be kept vacant if suitable candidates couldn’t be found under the quota. In 2012, the government reserved an additional 1 percent of jobs for people with disabilities. In effect, this left only 44 percent of jobs for merit. Students demonstrated against the quota system even in 2013, but in 2015, the High Court bench of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh ruled that the quota for freedom fighters and their offspring cannot be changed. Yet, nothing was done to ensure that. Unfortunately, some applicants close to the ruling regime procured fraudulent muktijoddha certificates, undermining reservation. In 2018, the Bangladesh Sadharan Chhatra Odhikar Sangrakkhan Parishad demanded quota reform and the filling of vacant positions from the reserved quota with candidates on the merit list. As is the case now, the Bangladesh Chhatra League attacked the students, and around 75 students were injured. The league has been at the forefront of violence on campuses and has been instrumentalised by the party since Hasina assumed power. However, the violent carnage unleashed this time was never seen before. The students were encouraged by Obaidul Qader, General Secretary of AL, who said the Chhatra League was sufficient to teach the students a lesson, even though the demonstration until then was peaceful. As the quota protest gained momentum, Abu Sayeed, a poor and unarmed student demonstrating against the quota system, was shot on July 16. The private universities joined the movement as it became a pan-Bangladesh student movement.What triggered the anger this time was Prime Minister Hasina’s statement. In a press conference, Hasina said, “If the grandchildren of freedom fighters don't get quota benefits, will those then go to grandchildren of Rajakars? That's my question, the countrymen's question”. This equating of protesting students with Rajakars fuelled the students’ anger, who only demanded reform for the quota system, not complete abolition. Rajakar is a pejorative term for those who collaborated with the Pakistan Army and opposed Bangladesh’s liberation. Moreover, there was a strong perception that the government sanctioned the high court decision as the institutions were deeply politicised. A divided countrySince the 1971 liberation war, Bangladesh has been divided over the debate on who are freedom fighters and who are Pakistani regime collaborators. After being elected to power in 2008, Hasina’s government established war crime tribunals to try those who committed war crimes in 1971. Several leaders, especially from the Jamaat-i-Islami and one prominent leader from the BNP, were convicted of war crimes and hanged. The trial concluded, but the Awami League frequently used the term Rajakar or collaborator. The students, to counter Hasina’s recent label of Rajakar, started using the slogan: Who are you? Who am I? Rajakar, Rajakar! They soon realised the gravity of using this epithet and immediately changed the slogan to “I went to ask for my rights; instead, I became a Rajakar.”People cutting across the party line supported the students and asked the government to initiate a dialogue. Yet there were no takers as the government remained unmoved. As a way out, the government requested the Supreme Court to advance the date for hearing the government appeal against the High Court verdict. The Supreme Court, in its verdict on July 22, declared 93 percent of jobs to be based on merit and 7 percent would be reserved for various categories. Yet this has not satisfied the students, and they have been urging the government to take action against those involved in the recent killings.Temporary thaw?Students have been demanding the release of their leaders and those arrested during the protest, and the deadline for this demand lapsed on July 28. The government is now on an arrest spree, catching the leaders of political parties as well as those involved in violence. It is strengthening its case to accuse the opposition of instigating student violence to topple Hasina’s government. Clearly, Chhatra Shibir, the student front of the deregistered Jamaat Islami Party, was at the forefront of the violence. The politicisation of the student movement by all the political parties only made the situation murkier. It is also true that the unearthing of several corruption cases against senior government officials amounting to billions has put a question mark on Hasina’s commitment to preventing corruption. This has added to the public’s resentment. Unfortunately, the use of the Chhatra League, along with the police, to contain student agitation by perpetuating violence has become the norm. The government must seriously address this issue. Second, while the Supreme Court verdict has given a temporary respite, the students demand an empathetic hearing. They should not be the target of Bangladesh’s vengeful politics or used as pawns in settling scores with the opposition party.

The description of “solid social structure”, as Baral admits in the same piece, is inherently “syncretic and synthetic”.Syncretism is sometimes defined as “the large-scale imposition of one alien culture, religion, or body of practices over another that is already present”. There can be no better depiction of formulating the culture of the Khas-Arya community of the Gandak region as “national” and then forcing the Janjatis of hills and mountains and the Madheshis to adopt it as their own. Hegemonic assertions about Nepal having enjoyed “a culture of peace and harmony” at any point in time are purely synthetic. The proposition fails the verification test in the light of subaltern experiences.Fictitious formulationsThe manufactured nostalgia of an imagined past in Nepal begins with the emergence of the Gorkha Empire in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Perhaps in tune with the times of colonial expansion elsewhere in South Asia, the Gorkha Empire was a culturally missionary and politically expansionist power. The victors from Gorkha encouraged the promotion of Brahminical religion, Gorkha Bhasha and hierarchical practices wherever possible and imposed them everywhere in the annexed territories if necessary. Since the Gorkhali pandits were entrusted with proselytising the defeated population from animism, shamanism or other indigenous practices prevalent in the mountains, hills and plains of the extended Empire, they often weren’t too learned. They used the myths and stories of the Puranas rather than the edicts of the Vedas. Fatalistic, misogynistic and Brahminical values of what is called the “Nepali society” perhaps owe more to the Bhagavata and Garuda Puranas than to the Mahabharata and Ramayana epics.After being roundly defeated in the Anglo-Gorkha War of 1814-16, the courtiers in Kathmandu badly needed an apologia to save face and keep the morale of their troops intact. The narrative of escaping from the colonial ambition of the East India Company (EIC) was manufactured to hide the humiliation heaped upon the Gorkha Empire through the Treaty of Sugauli. Beginning with his exploratory and submissive mission to Europe in 1850-51, Jung Bahadur Rana concluded the acceptance of being a loyal servant of the Company Bahadur—as the EIC was popularly called in the Indo-Gangetic plains—by offering his personal as well as official services for the brutal suppression of the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857.In addition to honouring the Gurkha sacrifices in World War I and ensuring a steady supply of recruits for the British troops, perhaps an additional objective of the Treaty of 1923 was to keep Nepal safe from the Soviet-backed nationalist regime asserting itself in China. Since Chandra Shamsher had readily agreed to remain a loyal vassal, there was hardly any need for the British to occupy a subsidiary kingdom. The balloon of ‘never been colonised’ is a divertissement to deflect attention away from a subservient status.

This approach was unlikely to work in Kosala and Videha, where the refinement of Aryan civilisation predated its ascent along the river valleys into the mountains.

There is thus no easy way to make young Nepalis stay back in their own country, either to work or to study. The best the country can hope is that at least some of its youths who get a good education or valuable work experience abroad come back and do something worthwhile in their homeland. There are ways to encourage this trend. The national economy needs to grow at a decent clip, putting more disposable income in people’s hands and boosting enterprises and industries. More than that, having policy stability will allow businesses to plan long-term. It’s a virtuous cycle. Yet, even in the best-case scenario, a touch of realism is warranted: There is only so much a developing state like Nepal can do to keep its youth rooted in their country—if such a policy is advisable.Japan seems to be the new destination of choice for Nepali students. In the just-completed fiscal year, over 112,000 students obtained the ‘no objection certificates’ (NOCs) from the Ministry of Education. (Such letters are mandatory for Nepali students to study abroad.) The ministry issued over 34,000 NOCs for Japan, followed by over 15,000 for Canada, over 14,000 for Australia, over 13,000 for the UK, and a touch over 11,000 for the US. The appeal of Japan has been steadily rising as education there is relatively cheaper compared to studying in Western countries and a Nepali student in Japan can work for up to 28 hours a week. Interestingly, the high influx of foreign students has sparked a debate in Japan, traditionally a closed country, on the costs and benefits of accepting migrants of all kinds. Pretty much the same thing is happening in Australia, which has over the past year tightened its rules for foreign students. As Australia tightened its borders, Nepali students seem to have shifted to Japan. So, again, part of the reason Nepali students go abroad is undoubtedly economic. Yet it is far from the whole story. Rather than looking to keep young folks in the country at all costs, the goal could rather be to build a capable network of people of Nepali origin, wherever they are in the world, and harness this collective power for the country’s good. For instance, Nepalis in North America collaborated to push for the Nepal Open University, the distance learning public university established in 2016. As the gig economy takes off and studying online gains popularity, distance learning gives people the flexibility to juggle their study, work and other commitments. The potential for such collaboration is endless, if only the host country creates the right environment. Moreover, even as it is, there is a steady stream of young professionals coming back to Nepal from abroad and setting up their own businesses and ventures.

The same government, however, garnered praise in a matter of days when Prime Minister Oli appointed Lila Devi Badtaula as the Nepal government’s first female Chief Secretary. While undeniably historic in a country where men are at the forefront of leadership positions, it is difficult to ignore the political context surrounding Badtaula’s selection, which came amid a public outcry over the severe underrepresentation of women in the Cabinet. Her appointment at the end of her career and only when former chief secretary Baikuntha Aryal was suspended—outgoing Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal had appointed Badtaula an acting chief secretary on July 15—is suggestive of the disregard for having women in top positions when men are around. This raises questions about whether Badtaula’s promotion was no more than a tactical move to quell public discontent. The prime minister, silent about the biases in Cabinet, boasted on Facebook on Saturday, “I saw many friends writing about Nepali women who have reached high leadership positions on social media yesterday. I am also pleased with these four coincidences that became possible under my positive initiative”. The pictures showed the first female President, Bidhya Devi Bhandari; the first female Chief Justice, Sushila Karki; the first woman speaker in the House of Representatives, Onsari Gharti; and Badtaula—all of whom were appointed during Oli’s government leadership at different times. We also have another unforgettable name Sewa Lamsal (the first female foreign secretary), at present. The world is forging ahead towards gender inclusivity, bringing more women to the fore, be it in politics or administration, and Nepal also seems somewhat committed to it. The country has significantly improved women’s political representation, who now occupy 91 seats in the 275-member federal parliament. And apart from politics, as per the Department of National Personnel Records, out of 85,513 civil service employees, 20.64 percent are female; seven are secretaries besides the chief secretary. Even so, genuine gender equality and inclusion is far from ensured. These seemingly “historic” achievements, each carrying the tag “the first woman,” however, fail to represent a whole lot of Nepali women. It is uncertain whether more women will consistently fill the positions left by their ‘female firsts’. As concerning is the exclusion of women from marginalised communities in the top roles, where the Khas-Arya dominate.Things won’t improve much unless more women are elected through first-past-the-post or direct elections—in the 2022 elections just nine women were directly elected—and unless women stopped being played as token cards. And this will never come without political leaders’ willingness to change. As men dominate Nepali politics, women are “given” positions. Tokenism will never lead to women’s empowerment and equality; it will in fact prove detrimental to the realisation of our gender-equal dreams. True gender equality requires more than symbolic gestures; it demands substantive change in our behaviour in how we treat women both at home and in public positions. As of yet, political positions are seen as something that only men can handle, and women are largely sidelined or dismissed. Because of this, not many women aspire to be politicians or top administrators. This structural discrimination against women undermines the constitutional spirit of equality of opportunity for people of all genders and socio-economic backgrounds.

And how does the public trust a government packed with such tainted figures? In the latest instance of shamelessness, Nepali Congress has picked Badshah Kurmi, someone who is being investigated in a grave crime of the disappearance of a woman, as a minister in Lumbini province.

An earlier government committee formed to look into the matter had recommended that eight people, including Badshah, be apprehended and investigated in the case. The seven others were arrested, but not Badshah. Over in Gandaki province, Rajeev Gurung who is better known as Deepak Manange, a gangster who has been repeatedly jailed, is the minister for physical infrastructure, in what is his fourth stint as a provincial minister. On Saturday, a photo of Manange seated at his office chair in a vest went viral online. Reportedly, he had gathered his friends there, where they proceeded to drink till midnight.

But even as their power grows, their sense of responsibility towards the society seems to be diminishing.Again, the country’s two biggest and best established political parties are openly promoting criminals and gangsters. Criminals of all persuasions in Nepal are known to join politics just to evade arrest. Not only do they ward off arrest, they even get lucrative positions. The country’s politics has become a pure numbers game, where getting to power is worth any cost. Our current prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, once said that criminals should get to shed their tainted past and serve the people by joining politics. He has over the years cultivated more than a handful of goons in his party. Oli’s current main partner-in-crime in the government, Sher Bahadur Deuba, has also over the years been tone-deaf to the criticism of his generosity towards politicians of baser characters. It is thanks to an attitude like this that people see the whole political class as a crime syndicate. Is the self-image of our mananiyas and ministers that of protectors and promoters of criminals, people wonder.  ","summary":"The Nepali political class is by and large considered immune to public criticism.

Then, over in Bagmati province, Min Krishna Maharjan, a gun-loving thug, has been given the post of the minister for sports. The country’s two biggest political parties are now in power together, promising political stability and clean governance. Yet neither the Nepali Congress nor the CPN-UML seems much interested in controlling the criminalisation of politics. In fact, they are encouraging it. The two parties have nearly two-thirds majority in the federal lower house and hold the keys to all seven provincial governments as well. But even as their power grows, their sense of responsibility towards the society seems to be diminishing.Again, the country’s two biggest and best established political parties are openly promoting criminals and gangsters. Criminals of all persuasions in Nepal are known to join politics just to evade arrest. Not only do they ward off arrest, they even get lucrative positions. The country’s politics has become a pure numbers game, where getting to power is worth any cost. Our current prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, once said that criminals should get to shed their tainted past and serve the people by joining politics. He has over the years cultivated more than a handful of goons in his party. Oli’s current main partner-in-crime in the government, Sher Bahadur Deuba, has also over the years been tone-deaf to the criticism of his generosity towards politicians of baser characters. It is thanks to an attitude like this that people see the whole political class as a crime syndicate. Is the self-image of our mananiyas and ministers that of protectors and promoters of criminals, people wonder.  "},{"hash":"2c1526679a6b95841203ce8a2f1e6ac4c3a33609e121817e8dad10bc04048f92","title":"economic-reforms-are-the-most-we-can-expect-from-this-coalition","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/07/29/economic-reforms-are-the-most-we-can-expect-from-this-coalition","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/GovindaPokhrel07272024006-1722214689.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1722211200000,"source":"kp","category":"interviews","content":"Within days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them.

The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource. ","summary":"Scores of people have been killed in landslides, floods and other monsoon-induced disasters within a month of the monsoon entering Nepal in the second week of June. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource.

Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy.

As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  ","summary":"The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli. As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual.

The National Examination Board had enforced the ‘non-graded’ category from this year. The underperformance of the majority of school students has stirred a fresh debate about the test system. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former National Planning Commission member Usha Jha, who led the committee that recommended the government to adopt the letter grading system.How do you analyse the SEE results published on Thursday?People have reacted to it with shock, not me. In fact, on the basis of the teaching system that is being practised in our schools, I think the results are good. We get the results based on what and how we teach students. Over 52 percent of students have been categorised as non-graded. We need to identify and address the causes behind the bad results. I have heard some people blame the letter grading system. This is wrong. A form of letter grading system was already there. We only suggested an upgraded form of the system. If we start blaming the system, we won’t find the real cause of the problem. What may be the real causes that you are hinting at?The first is the poor quality of teachers in our country. A form of letter grading system was there even before. But it had two loopholes. First, the government took an approach whereby all students would pass. That gave an impression to the students that they don’t need to study hard. That degraded the quality of their education. Second, there was a system of giving marks based on the students’ performances in theoretical and practical exams. Of the total 100 marks, the practical exams made up 35 marks. Most students were given maximum marks in the practical exams. That helped them get higher grades even if they didn’t do well in theoretical exams. This system encouraged students to neglect theoretical studies. That has caused huge damage to our education system. The letter grade system introduced this year has closed those loopholes. But the letter grading system requires a learning environment. The system was introduced without adequate preparation for its effective implementation. Also, the Covid pandemic disturbed preparatory works at the time. We should have drastically improved classroom teaching practices, and trained teachers across the country because their teaching methods are outdated. They weren’t trained on the grading system. They give lectures and encourage students to memorise while the letter grading system requires a thorough process and encourages result-oriented learning. It doesn’t prioritise marks. Our teachers and schools lacked the capacity to implement the new system. Teachers weren’t trained and prepared. Even now, most teachers don’t know what the letter grading system is. The system is necessary to make our students compete in global markets.While we upgraded the system, we didn’t upgrade the schools and teachers. Our teachers engage only in routine and formal responsibilities such as completing textbook courses before the examinations. This system should be properly internalised not only by teachers and students but also school management, palikas [local units] and parents of the students. Only then can it be effectively implemented. These are the major reasons behind the poor results. How is the students’ performance evaluated in the letter grading system?First, teachers should study a lot. They take reference of the subject matter from the textbook and teach students giving a broader perspective of the matter. They have to engage the students practically on the issue. The students should be regularly evaluated based on their participation and response in study and activities. The teachers should teach them and constantly monitor whether they are learning and making progress. The marking should be based on that. So, in this system, the examination starts from day 1 and everyday activities contribute to their marks. It also takes other activities such as behaviour, understanding, presentation into consideration. Therefore, it is called a regular assessment system based on a thorough process, unlike the traditional three-hour-long yearly examination method. If the teachers aren’t competent to carry out these activities, this idea can’t yield good results. They badly need capacity enhancement. The pedagogy should be remodelled.What was the rationale behind the decision to implement this system?One reason was to upgrade our education’s standard on par with the international standards and make our students fit for global markets. In the course of formulating this policy, we undertook a comprehensive research of international practices. Based on that evidence-based research, we submitted a report to then education minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. The government studied and endorsed it. Basically, this system was introduced with an objective of upgrading our education system in the changed context. But we lacked preparations to implement this idea.We will make a mistake if we change this system. I heard that the education minister [Sumana Shrestha] decided to make some changes in the policy and allow all non-graded students to sit for chance examinations, whereas the system says only those students who secured non-grades in two subjects can retake exams for the same subjects. There is no point in changing the method to favour even the students who have failed in all the subjects. She should have made it clear what factors made her change the criteria overnight. I cannot understand why the minister made the decision in a haste without considering its impact.In fact, our next step should have been capacity enhancement of teachers. The minister took some right decisions such as separating teachers from political parties. But an incumbent minister changing a system that was implemented by a previous minister would cause a problem. She could have formed a panel to conduct a study to find if the letter grading system is the main cause behind the students’ underperformance. But changing a policy through an order didn’t look good.Results show our students are very poor in mathematics, science and English. What could be the reasons?This is unfortunate. We saw similar trends in previous years as well. Mathematics and science are becoming more challenging. One reason is the lack of sufficient teachers for these subjects. Also, some teachers are under-utilised. Some teachers don’t go to the schools. So special measures need to be taken to manage teachers mainly for these subjects. Otherwise, we will have similar results in the coming years.The committee under your leadership recommended that those getting a GPA below 1.6 have to choose technical courses and those willing to study Grade 11 must score above 1.6 GPA. What was the idea behind that recommendation?The idea was to end the situation of halting students’ study and activities because of their lower grades. We have a government body in the form of the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) which has been offering dozens of vocational training based on the needs and interests of people. So our youths can join a suitable CTEVT course. We need more people in vocational fields. Skilled people aren’t available in the country. A large number of people working in technical fields in Nepal are from India. We included the provision in consultation with CTEVT officials. Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel had also prepared a broad plan to implement the letter grading system and integrate the vocational part in our education system. The present government should improve the education system by enhancing teachers’ capacity and encouraging youths to join vocational training to fill the gaps in the employment market. Are the infrastructure and resources available in our education system sufficient to implement the grading system?Some schools lack even essential resources while in some we find misuse or underuse of resources. So, our education ministry should carry out a comprehensive mapping and find where teachers are required, where they are underutilised and where they are idle. Then, the government can make optimum use of the teachers and make additional investment on need-basis. Such an approach will yield better results. In general, our academic institutions lack resources as there is a trend of allocating insufficient budgets for the education sector. Yes, the letter grading system needs more investment. We have to work on teachers’ capacity enhancement and to provide learning materials to students. When you make an activity participatory, you certainly need resources and investments.Do we need to review our teacher recruitment process and our pedagogy in the universities that produce teachers?The government can consider new requirements while recruiting teachers and train them accordingly. Also, we need to update our curriculum and pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. I have doubts about the quality of our graduates, post-graduates and even PhD holders due to the poor teaching and learning environment of our academic institutions. There is a need for more coordination and collaboration between the government and universities to address such issues.In the end, I want to stress that the government should adopt a clear and consistent policy and avoid ad-hoc decisions. The letter grading system is the best and we should push for that despite the challenges in its implementation. Just that it should have been enforced after enhancing teachers’ capacity. The problems we have now are due to lack of preparation. ","summary":"In the Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) conducted this year, over 52 percent of students failed to graduate to grade 11. The National Examination Board had enforced the ‘non-graded’ category from this year. The underperformance of the majority of school students has stirred a fresh debate about the test system. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former National Planning Commission member Usha Jha, who led the committee that recommended the government to adopt the letter grading system.How do you analyse the SEE results published on Thursday?People have reacted to it with shock, not me. In fact, on the basis of the teaching system that is being practised in our schools, I think the results are good. We get the results based on what and how we teach students. Over 52 percent of students have been categorised as non-graded. We need to identify and address the causes behind the bad results. I have heard some people blame the letter grading system. This is wrong. A form of letter grading system was already there. We only suggested an upgraded form of the system. If we start blaming the system, we won’t find the real cause of the problem. What may be the real causes that you are hinting at?The first is the poor quality of teachers in our country. A form of letter grading system was there even before. But it had two loopholes. First, the government took an approach whereby all students would pass. That gave an impression to the students that they don’t need to study hard. That degraded the quality of their education. Second, there was a system of giving marks based on the students’ performances in theoretical and practical exams. Of the total 100 marks, the practical exams made up 35 marks. Most students were given maximum marks in the practical exams. That helped them get higher grades even if they didn’t do well in theoretical exams. This system encouraged students to neglect theoretical studies. That has caused huge damage to our education system. The letter grade system introduced this year has closed those loopholes. But the letter grading system requires a learning environment. The system was introduced without adequate preparation for its effective implementation. Also, the Covid pandemic disturbed preparatory works at the time. We should have drastically improved classroom teaching practices, and trained teachers across the country because their teaching methods are outdated. They weren’t trained on the grading system. They give lectures and encourage students to memorise while the letter grading system requires a thorough process and encourages result-oriented learning. It doesn’t prioritise marks. Our teachers and schools lacked the capacity to implement the new system. Teachers weren’t trained and prepared. Even now, most teachers don’t know what the letter grading system is. The system is necessary to make our students compete in global markets.While we upgraded the system, we didn’t upgrade the schools and teachers. Our teachers engage only in routine and formal responsibilities such as completing textbook courses before the examinations. This system should be properly internalised not only by teachers and students but also school management, palikas [local units] and parents of the students. Only then can it be effectively implemented. These are the major reasons behind the poor results. How is the students’ performance evaluated in the letter grading system?First, teachers should study a lot. They take reference of the subject matter from the textbook and teach students giving a broader perspective of the matter. They have to engage the students practically on the issue. The students should be regularly evaluated based on their participation and response in study and activities. The teachers should teach them and constantly monitor whether they are learning and making progress. The marking should be based on that. So, in this system, the examination starts from day 1 and everyday activities contribute to their marks. It also takes other activities such as behaviour, understanding, presentation into consideration. Therefore, it is called a regular assessment system based on a thorough process, unlike the traditional three-hour-long yearly examination method. If the teachers aren’t competent to carry out these activities, this idea can’t yield good results. They badly need capacity enhancement. The pedagogy should be remodelled.What was the rationale behind the decision to implement this system?One reason was to upgrade our education’s standard on par with the international standards and make our students fit for global markets. In the course of formulating this policy, we undertook a comprehensive research of international practices. Based on that evidence-based research, we submitted a report to then education minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. The government studied and endorsed it. Basically, this system was introduced with an objective of upgrading our education system in the changed context. But we lacked preparations to implement this idea.We will make a mistake if we change this system. I heard that the education minister [Sumana Shrestha] decided to make some changes in the policy and allow all non-graded students to sit for chance examinations, whereas the system says only those students who secured non-grades in two subjects can retake exams for the same subjects. There is no point in changing the method to favour even the students who have failed in all the subjects. She should have made it clear what factors made her change the criteria overnight. I cannot understand why the minister made the decision in a haste without considering its impact.In fact, our next step should have been capacity enhancement of teachers. The minister took some right decisions such as separating teachers from political parties. But an incumbent minister changing a system that was implemented by a previous minister would cause a problem. She could have formed a panel to conduct a study to find if the letter grading system is the main cause behind the students’ underperformance. But changing a policy through an order didn’t look good.Results show our students are very poor in mathematics, science and English. What could be the reasons?This is unfortunate. We saw similar trends in previous years as well. Mathematics and science are becoming more challenging. One reason is the lack of sufficient teachers for these subjects. Also, some teachers are under-utilised. Some teachers don’t go to the schools. So special measures need to be taken to manage teachers mainly for these subjects. Otherwise, we will have similar results in the coming years.The committee under your leadership recommended that those getting a GPA below 1.6 have to choose technical courses and those willing to study Grade 11 must score above 1.6 GPA. What was the idea behind that recommendation?The idea was to end the situation of halting students’ study and activities because of their lower grades. We have a government body in the form of the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) which has been offering dozens of vocational training based on the needs and interests of people. So our youths can join a suitable CTEVT course. We need more people in vocational fields. Skilled people aren’t available in the country. A large number of people working in technical fields in Nepal are from India. We included the provision in consultation with CTEVT officials. Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel had also prepared a broad plan to implement the letter grading system and integrate the vocational part in our education system. The present government should improve the education system by enhancing teachers’ capacity and encouraging youths to join vocational training to fill the gaps in the employment market. Are the infrastructure and resources available in our education system sufficient to implement the grading system?Some schools lack even essential resources while in some we find misuse or underuse of resources. So, our education ministry should carry out a comprehensive mapping and find where teachers are required, where they are underutilised and where they are idle. Then, the government can make optimum use of the teachers and make additional investment on need-basis. Such an approach will yield better results. In general, our academic institutions lack resources as there is a trend of allocating insufficient budgets for the education sector. Yes, the letter grading system needs more investment. We have to work on teachers’ capacity enhancement and to provide learning materials to students. When you make an activity participatory, you certainly need resources and investments.Do we need to review our teacher recruitment process and our pedagogy in the universities that produce teachers?The government can consider new requirements while recruiting teachers and train them accordingly.
