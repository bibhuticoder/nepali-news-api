This was not envisioned while drafting the constitution, according to experts.Before the federal system, the authority was centralised. Even though the country was divided into five development regions and 75 districts, they only served as administrative hubs and centres.

Also, the local governments have all executive, legislative and judicial powers exercised by an elected council.“The country’s federal structure was designed to devolve the central government’s rights to the provinces and local units.

However, Adhikari questions the rationale behind such an amendment.“If the political leadership allows provinces to exercise their rights without dictating their daily functions from the centre, the federal system will still work,” he adds. “But they are afraid to give up power that they have been exercising for years to the subnational governments.”The July 1 change in the central coalition caused immediate jolts at the provinces.As per the two-party agreement, the UML formed the government at the centre with the Congress rallying KP Sharma Oli of the second largest party.The two parties also reached an agreement to lead governments in three provinces each while they supported the Janamat Party to form the provincial government in Madhesh.

Except in Sudurpaschim, the governments in the other five provinces have already been formed. Chief Minister of Sudurpaschim Province Dirgha Sodari of the CPN (Unified Socialist), which is now in the opposition coalition, resigned on Friday.This arrangement in the provinces will change again, with the handover in federal government leadership to the Nepali Congress after two years from the day Oli was appointed the prime minister. Prime Minister Oli, reading out the seven-point agreement from the rostrum of Parliament on July 21, said he will lead the federal government for two years, and hand over the mantle to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba.With the change in leadership at the centre, coalitions in the provinces too are expected to realign. “Even so, there will not be the kind of instability we saw earlier,” says Congress Chief Whip Shyam Kumar Ghimire.With the change of power equations at the centre, the whole dynamics of provincial politics changed, he said. For instance, in under two years, the Koshi government changed five times. “Though the provincial governments’ leadership can change as per the two-party deal, the Congress or the UML will continue to lead, thus providing political stability.” There are already signs of discord in the Congress-UML alliance.Congress and UML leaders have already started disputing power sharing in Gandaki Province, where Congress is leading the government.UML provincial leaders have been warning Gandaki Chief Minister Surendra Pandey of the Congress not to take long-term decisions as they expressed reservations over some of his moves.

One of the company officials said they are planning to resume the Janakpur-Ayodhya railway service soon.Currently, the Nepal-India railway connecting Bijalpura, Mahottari with Jayanagar (India) has been in operation since April 2022 after it was upgraded from a narrow-gauge to a broad-gauge line.“We used to run trains between Janakpur and Ayodhya, whose service was later halted,” said Balaram Mishra, a member of the Railway Board and former head of the railway department. “Now, we are resuming the same service at least once a week.”On December 17, 2023, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport devised a plan to run a railway service between Janakpur and the Indian capital, New Delhi, via Ayodhya. However, in the first phase, the service will be between Janakpur and Ayodhya.According to officials, there is a proposal to run a pair of trains every Saturday. The Indian train will leave Janakpur at 1:30 pm and will reach Ayodhya at around 4:30 am on Sunday. Then, the train will depart for Janakpur at 5:00 pm on Sunday and reach Janakpur on Monday morning.On January 14 last year, the Indian Ministry of Railways announced that it would operate a special train for pilgrims connecting Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh with Janakpur in Nepal. The ‘Bharat Gaurav Deluxe Train’ will also pass through Nandigram, Sitamarhi, Kashi, and Prayagraj, according to a statement by the Indian Ministry of Railways. The first train on the route will be flagged off on February 17 from New Delhi. But the plan was cancelled later.“To realise Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of showcasing India’s rich cultural heritage and magnificent historical places to the people of India and the world, Indian Railways is going to run the train covering two of the most significant pilgrimage sites: Ayodhya and Janakpur,” read the statement.“The initiative will strengthen the bilateral relations and also promote the cultural relations between the two countries.”Some foreign ministry officials claim that the prime ministers of Nepal and India will flag off the new service, but there is no official confirmation yet.Mishra said discussions on how to operate the railway regularly continue. Relevant officials are also working on modalities with Indian railway officials.The proposed seven-day ‘Bharat Gaurav Tourist Train’ tour’s first stop is Ayodhya, the birthplace of Lord Ram. There, tourists will visit Shri Ram Janmbhumi temple, Hanuman temple, and Bharat Mandir at Nandigram.Officials said the train service between the two cultural cities of Nepal and India is going to relaunch, with its inauguration due soon.Mishra said that since Nepal’s railway track is connected with India’s line in Jayanagar, Nepali rail can operate between Janakpur and New Delhi and other Indian cities via Jayanagar.On January 22, the two sides were planning to operate a special railway service between Janakpur and Ayodhya ahead of Lord Rama’s consecration ceremony, or prana pratishtha at the temple dedicated to the Treta Yuga king, but it was struck off the agenda at the last minute. The ceremony at Lord Ram’s birthplace took place on January 24. According to Hindu mythology, Lord Ram married Sita of Janakpur.

Few works have been done for the implementation of the latest trade strategy and the result is not as expected,” said an official at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies requesting anonymity.

Making plans alone doesn’t work if they are not properly executed,” said Purushottam Ojha, former commerce secretary and trade expert in a recent interview with the Post. “There are problems in increasing and enhancing production, assuring quality and marketing Nepali products.”A major implication of LDC graduation is the loss of preferential market access available through LDC-specific schemes under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) and other arrangements.After LDC graduation, Nepal may lose a huge European market as it might not get facilities under the Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative. This scheme grants full duty-free and quota-free access to the European Union Single Market for all products (except arms and ammunition).There are around 184 activities for the implementation of the NTIS and provision requiring monitoring and evaluation. But the monitoring mechanism does not seem to have done its work, a trade expert said.

They included some key Maoist leaders such as Ram Bahadur Thapa, Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, Lekh Raj Bhatta, Prabhu Sah and Mani Thapa. Some central committee members and scores of other cadres from various lower committees followed them to join the UML, the bigger communist party among the two.The UML and the Maoist Centre jointly fought the general elections in 2017 and later merged to form the NCP in 2018. But the merger was challenged in court, accusing them of copying the name of a fringe communist party. The Supreme Court in 2021 invalidated the merger, reviving their original parties.While around 30 central level Maoist leaders had joined UML, only a few have succeeded to hold important positions in the UML.CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli on Thursday convened the party’s central secretariat meeting to divide work among the leaders as several of them have become ministers in federal and provincial governments. The same meeting relieved former Maoist leader Mani Thapa of all his positions and roles from the party citing his failure to fulfill the roles and responsibilities assigned by the organisation.Thapa, who was a standing committee member in the UML, however, had reportedly tendered his resignation around a year ago expressing his differences on various issues with the UML leadership.Former key maoist leaders Ram Bahadur Thapa and Lekh Raj Bhatta are now vice-chair and secretary in the UML, respectively. Former Maoist leader Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, who was elected UML secretary in 2022, is now suspended after he is accused in Bhutanese refugee scam. He is now in judicial custody as the case is sub-judice.Prabhu Sah, a prominent Maoist leader of Madhesh Province, quit the UML to form the Aam Janata Party.Lil Bahadur Thapa and Jwala Kumari Sah are politburo members in the UML.According to multiple UML leaders with Maoist background, Mani Thapa remained inactive in the party activities and he also remained inactive during the November 2022 election.A Maoist-turned-UML leader said that the former Maoist Centre leaders, who were given more importance at the time of NCP split and immediately after joining the UML, were gradually sidelined. “That was one of the reasons why Mani Thapa became inactive in party activities,” the leader told the Post requesting anonymity.At the time of the NCP split, UML chair Oli was in serious trouble as the then UML leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhalanath Khanal, backed by a powerful group of second-rung leaders, had challenged him in the party. At the time, Oli managed to stay in the leadership taking support of the former Maoist leaders.“Thapa was a standing committee member in the UML. I am not aware of what exactly he had expected in the party but he was unhappy,” another UML leader with Maoist background told the Post. “It was Thapa’s personal decision to stay away from party activities. It has nothing to do with the party’s work style.”The Post’s attempts to contact Thapa were unsuccessful.Among the leaders who left the Maoist Centre to join the UML, Ram Bahadur Thapa, Rayamajhi, and Bhatta had played crucial roles in leading the decade-long Maoist insurgency.Some UML leaders with Maoist backgrounds admitted that they get discouraged when the party leadership does not acknowledge the people’s war. At times, UML leaders including chair Oli express critical views against Maoists and their decade-long insurgency.“It is true that UML leadership, especially chair KP Sharma Oli, ruthlessly criticises people’s war, but it is also the fact that both the parties signed a 12-point agreement and agreed to work together for the betterment of the country in 2006,” a former Maoist, currently with the UML, told the Post.The leader said that UML is the suitable option for communists in the country as the Maoist Centre’s political prospects have drastically diminished in recent years. “Though some of their statements on the Maoist insurgency at times cause bitterness, UML is the safest place for us now,” he added.Niru Darlami, another Maoist-turned-UML leader, rubbished the claims that former Maoists were deprived of opportunities in the UML. Some Maoist leaders got a chance to become ministers after joining the UML, says a UML leader.Mani Thapa himself was never given a ministerial position as a Maoist Centre leader but soon after joining the UML, he got the opportunity to lead the Ministry of Water Supply under the KP Sharma Oli government.Similarly, Jwala Kumari Sah held ministerial berths more than three times after joining the UML.Giridharilal Naupane, another UML leader with Maoist background, claimed that the leaders’ former Maoist background was no longer an issue in the UML. “We former Maoist leaders have already been mixed in the UML like sugar in water,” he said. “If some former Maoist leader raises the question to UML, it is due to their misunderstanding.”Meanwhile, some leaders argue that the UML leadership didn’t support Rayamajhi when he got in trouble after being accused in the refugee scam. The party leader still considered Rayamajhi an outsider, they say.“If any UML leader other than Rayamajhi was indicted in the refugee scam, the UML would have made a lot of efforts to release him from custody,” a Maoist-turned-UML leader told the Post on condition of anonymity.However, Maoist-turned-UML leader Tanka Angbuhang, who claims to have met Rayamajhi recently in jail, claims that Rayamajhi himself does not feel the party has alienated him.“During our meeting, Rayamajhi did not show any displeasure to the party,” Aangbuhang told the Post.

He is now in judicial custody as the case is sub-judice.Prabhu Sah, a prominent Maoist leader of Madhesh Province, quit the UML to form the Aam Janata Party.Lil Bahadur Thapa and Jwala Kumari Sah are politburo members in the UML.According to multiple UML leaders with Maoist background, Mani Thapa remained inactive in the party activities and he also remained inactive during the November 2022 election.A Maoist-turned-UML leader said that the former Maoist Centre leaders, who were given more importance at the time of NCP split and immediately after joining the UML, were gradually sidelined. “That was one of the reasons why Mani Thapa became inactive in party activities,” the leader told the Post requesting anonymity.At the time of the NCP split, UML chair Oli was in serious trouble as the then UML leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhalanath Khanal, backed by a powerful group of second-rung leaders, had challenged him in the party. At the time, Oli managed to stay in the leadership taking support of the former Maoist leaders.“Thapa was a standing committee member in the UML. I am not aware of what exactly he had expected in the party but he was unhappy,” another UML leader with Maoist background told the Post. “It was Thapa’s personal decision to stay away from party activities. It has nothing to do with the party’s work style.”The Post’s attempts to contact Thapa were unsuccessful.Among the leaders who left the Maoist Centre to join the UML, Ram Bahadur Thapa, Rayamajhi, and Bhatta had played crucial roles in leading the decade-long Maoist insurgency.Some UML leaders with Maoist backgrounds admitted that they get discouraged when the party leadership does not acknowledge the people’s war. At times, UML leaders including chair Oli express critical views against Maoists and their decade-long insurgency.“It is true that UML leadership, especially chair KP Sharma Oli, ruthlessly criticises people’s war, but it is also the fact that both the parties signed a 12-point agreement and agreed to work together for the betterment of the country in 2006,” a former Maoist, currently with the UML, told the Post.The leader said that UML is the suitable option for communists in the country as the Maoist Centre’s political prospects have drastically diminished in recent years. “Though some of their statements on the Maoist insurgency at times cause bitterness, UML is the safest place for us now,” he added.Niru Darlami, another Maoist-turned-UML leader, rubbished the claims that former Maoists were deprived of opportunities in the UML. Some Maoist leaders got a chance to become ministers after joining the UML, says a UML leader.Mani Thapa himself was never given a ministerial position as a Maoist Centre leader but soon after joining the UML, he got the opportunity to lead the Ministry of Water Supply under the KP Sharma Oli government.Similarly, Jwala Kumari Sah held ministerial berths more than three times after joining the UML.Giridharilal Naupane, another UML leader with Maoist background, claimed that the leaders’ former Maoist background was no longer an issue in the UML. “We former Maoist leaders have already been mixed in the UML like sugar in water,” he said. “If some former Maoist leader raises the question to UML, it is due to their misunderstanding.”Meanwhile, some leaders argue that the UML leadership didn’t support Rayamajhi when he got in trouble after being accused in the refugee scam. The party leader still considered Rayamajhi an outsider, they say.“If any UML leader other than Rayamajhi was indicted in the refugee scam, the UML would have made a lot of efforts to release him from custody,” a Maoist-turned-UML leader told the Post on condition of anonymity.However, Maoist-turned-UML leader Tanka Angbuhang, who claims to have met Rayamajhi recently in jail, claims that Rayamajhi himself does not feel the party has alienated him.“During our meeting, Rayamajhi did not show any displeasure to the party,” Aangbuhang told the Post.

What I know is that they are well-attended and used by a wide cohort of researchers, scholars, dreamers and some freaks. That is, of course, the nature of conferences of such size anywhere in the world. The Baha conference is a focussed affair where senior scholars and PhD researchers converge. I was told some of them have already booked their conference seats for next year. Such is its popularity. They take up diverse themes like Nepal, the Himalayas, earth and ecology, nature, ideas, fieldwork methods, changing societies, mental problems, the agonies of Mother Earth, altitudes and human behaviours. This paints a picture of diversity. Serious and dedicated discussants and audiences give conferences a special character. There is no time for little breaks either in the day or night for a few rounds of poetry readings and music performances. No painter rushes with brush and palette. It would be a diversion.

The Literary Association of Nepal is another organisation that holds seminars annually. As chairman of both of these associations in the past, I can write other articles about the struggle to create a forum for such organisations. It was not easy to work at a time when the political system of the country was not democratic. The broader international participation and the free expression of opinions were particularly in focus. But we continued the work. Today, I feel happy that our erstwhile students, who have become academics, run these organisations. I remember making some short presentations at Baha in the past. This year, I was invited to discuss at a session \"Of Journeys and Worldviews: Formation of Early Modern Consciousness in Nepal\". Three Central Department of English academics, Shiva Rijal, Mahesh Paudyal and Komal Phuyal, made different presentations on the above theme. The courses in the department are interdisciplinary. They chose Nepali fictional and dramatic texts that address the times when travelling on foot was a common practice.According to these scholars, the well-known Nepali literary texts that depict this condition give a picture of a feudal society where people's physical mobility coheres with the level of consciousness and characters’ aspirations. Through their analyses of the texts, they discussed a condition of power and discipline; they evoked the theories of New Historicism and the power and knowledge of the French theorist Michael Foucault. My comments were woven around these themes. Rijal gave a picture of a society where an individual’s journeys, confusions and quests get dramatised in the plays. Travelling on foot sets the stage. He addressed the tension between the wide space of travel and its representation on small impromptu stages. The staging of Mukunda Indira (1939) and Sahanshila Sushila (1940) at Durbar High School and the newly opened Judhyodaya Public School, respectively, shows that theatrical reality. The text Mukunda Indira is set along the route to India, whereas Sahanshila Sushila is set in Kathmandu and Nuwakot. Rijal's theory is that ''Reading Nepal’s walking era through modern plays is not a literary experience alone.'' It opens up more.Phuyal chose early fictional texts like Lil Bahadur Chhetri’s Basain (1957) and Lain Sing Bandel’s Muluk Bahira (1948). He claimed these fictional works show the \"formation of the political self of the society.\" He sees through these novels the Nepali state making efforts to what he calls \"to intellectually and politically awake itself from the grip of traditional lynchpins.\" Paudyal’s choice of what he rightly calls \"seven representative Nepali short stories\" written in pre-modern Nepali times represent the long forties of the 20th century. As the engine-propelled means of transport had not become accessible, especially to the common people wanting to move, travelling became solely a bodily performance. He shows how, in the stories, this factor becomes a reality.In my observation, I put that some questions may be addressed while discussing the form of travel then. The accessibility of the rails in India for the Nepalis to travel extended the reality of what the paper writers rightly called pre-modern travel on foot. Through human contact, migration to places like Assam, Burma and other areas of British India became possible. However, the three paper presenters rightly evoked the conditionality of power and social mobility by using the mode of travel by foot. Using fictional characters, the paper writers gave their theory new power and explained the phenomenon of a consonance of life, reality and imagination. They had selected fiction and drama, which alone could capture that reality by bringing society, creativity and forward-looking dynamism into play. That dynamism is different from any anthropological or social study. A cohort of research-savvy audience, including Onta, discussed the subject introduced by the three scholars.

The repetition of this question only proves how blind to facts and disconnected with the people the government and Awami League leaders are. They are denying or seem to be oblivious to the fact that over 200 killed—the government itself admits to 150—and thousands injured by the indiscriminate firing by the police and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) has totally changed the situation. In one eye hospital in Dhaka, during the violence, nearly 400 people who sustained eye injuries were treated, 300 of whom had to be admitted, and 250 had to undergo eye surgery. The majority of them had pellet (a particular type of ammunition used by police during the recent violence) wounds in one or both eyes. Imagine what the total figure could be like. We have no count yet of how many will have to amputate one or both arms or legs due to gunshots, and how many more will have to be operated upon. How many will really return to normal life? Everything points to mindless violence that cannot be termed as police action to quell unrest that emanates from usual demonstrations in our part of the world. The evidence is of a mindset of \"shoot at sight,\" as announced by an AL leader.Today's issue is seeking justice. Justice for the massacre of students and other citizens, the unleashing of a killing machine that the police and BGB turned out to be, the large-scale arrests, the \"block raids,\" the house-to-house search, the false cases, and the insults of terming the demonstrators in general to be agents of destruction and anti-Bangladesh forces.The all-encompassing issue that has alienated the students and enraged the people is the atmosphere of fear under which all students, youth, politically involved citizens, and people in general are having to live. (A father called this author and said, \"I have a school-going son. I become tense with every sound of a car stopping near my house at night\".) The killings definitely stand as the most brutal retaliation by a government on any civic movement in the post-liberation Bangladesh history—and may be that of the subcontinent. We shudder at the thought of how a civilian government could allow its law enforcers to attack its own people with such brutality. The killing was not just an event, but one that took place over several days. Wasn't there any reflection, any afterthought and reassessment at the end of the first, second or third day that such heartless and continuous killing of one's own people must stop?What brought the party that led us during the Liberation War to this? Over 15 years of unaccountable power, greed, cronyism, wealth accumulation, abuse of authority, and the attitude that they are above the law.Of all the deaths, the most heart-rending is perhaps the story of Riya Gope, a six-year-old in Nayamati, Narayanganj, who was playing on the rooftop of their four-storey building. On July 19 afternoon, when police started firing on the demonstrators on the street near her house, her father Dipak Kumar Gope rushed to the roof to get her; he was carrying his daughter back to their flat when a bullet struck the child's head. She died at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) on July 25. How could a bullet hit someone on the roof of a four-storey building unless the police took an aim to do so? Was Riya a threat? The explanation will most likely be that it was an accident. But can that be acceptable when she was in her father's arms on the roof of a four-storey building?Use of helicopters to fire sound grenades and tear gas shells is a new element we saw in crowd-handling by the law enforcers this time around. However, there are disturbing accounts from the public, reporters and especially photographers that rifle shots were fired from these helicopters upon demonstrating crowds. On July 18 and 19, around mid-morning, helicopters hovered over Mayor Hanif Flyover, Shanir Akhra, Kajla and Signboard areas, sometimes sweeping down as they flew and fired on the crowd gathered below. These helicopters were clearly marked with the insignia of our law enforcers.The case of Sumaiya Akter in Narayanganj adds credibility to this claim. She was 20 years old and the mother of a healthy two-month-old daughter. Hearing the sound of the helicopter and that of the clashes going on outside, following her mother, Sumaiya ventured out to the veranda of her sixth floor apartment to see what was going on. She got hit by a live bullet and died soon after. Where could the bullet come from? Given the height and the location of the apartment, the most likely possibility is that the shot came from a helicopter, as claimed by her family. This gives substance to claims by many others that they saw gunshots coming from helicopters.How can a protesting crowd be fired upon from the air by their own government? Firing from helicopters is known to occur only when operating in an \"enemy\" territory or a location captured by armed terrorists. How can our own BGB or Rab or police fire upon our own people in such a manner?We demand a credible and thorough investigation on the use of helicopters and their firing on demonstrators. While the judicial investigation to probe all deaths should continue, a separate and fast-track probe must be conducted to reveal the truth on this specific matter.It must also be investigated as to what led to such a large-scale killing in the hands of law enforcers. Who made the threat assessment, and how? At what stage were they allowed to open fire on demonstrators, and who gave the orders to shoot? The rifles used were all modern and sophisticated. BGB used weapons meant to protect our borders. How could they be allowed to tackle student demonstrators with the same weapons? The investigation should also consider whether or not excessive force and disproportionate firepower were used against the demonstrators, none of whom have so far been seen to carry firearms. They were all carrying sticks and iron rods.It is our considered view that the government and the ruling party continue to live in their own bubble and underestimate the depth of the people's grievances that has resulted from the killings of students and the public. We also feel that peace will not return to the campuses and the streets until justice is done and convincingly seen to be done. Force can be used to \"calm\" the situation, but it will be temporary. The lengthier the period of uncertainty, the more grievous will be its impact on our economy and the country's international acceptability.Those who are used to using power to get their way are usually not aware of its limits. We have used Ansar, police, Rab, BGB and even the army, and an extreme measure like curfew. What has been the result? Yes, brutality, death, arrests and harassment can be further ratcheted up. But all that will generate more resentment, deeper hatred, and critical desperation. Such use of force may, at best, show a superficial show of calm, but will never solve our real problem of \"power corrupting and absolute power corrupting absolutely\" (adopting Lord Acton's time-honoured observation).We urge the government to no longer hide behind convenient narratives that stand totally contradicted by facts. We further urge them to examine the brutality with which the demonstrators have been treated and the death and injuries that ordinary students and the people have had to suffer, and respond to the call for justice. We also urge them to stop befooling themselves as facts are in people's hands due to modern technology. Yes, there could be a lot of false news and videos in the digital sphere. But there are many credible ones too.

It is one of the oldest activities that people across the world, irrespective of how advanced and sophisticated their social and cultural histories are, have engaged in and clung to. Indeed, gambling has been so pervasive in the human consciousness that it has assumed precision and advancement, including its harnessing by technology.Gambling was prevalent in ancient India, China, Rome, Egypt, Peru and Japan. Late 19th century historians found evidence of “gaming tables engraved or scratched on the marble or stone slabs, for the amusement of idle men, always ready to cheat each other out of their money” in ancient Rome. Over time, the acceptance of gambling varied from culture to culture.In the ancient Indian epic, Mahabharata, the reference to the game of the dice was central to the unmaking of a princely clan which put everything—including their kingdom and their queen—at stake.

It is one of the oldest activities that people across the world, irrespective of how advanced and sophisticated their social and cultural histories are, have engaged in and clung to. Indeed, gambling has been so pervasive in the human consciousness that it has assumed precision and advancement, including its harnessing by technology.Gambling was prevalent in ancient India, China, Rome, Egypt, Peru and Japan. Late 19th century historians found evidence of “gaming tables engraved or scratched on the marble or stone slabs, for the amusement of idle men, always ready to cheat each other out of their money” in ancient Rome. Over time, the acceptance of gambling varied from culture to culture.In the ancient Indian epic, Mahabharata, the reference to the game of the dice was central to the unmaking of a princely clan which put everything—including their kingdom and their queen—at stake. It is a prime instance of gambling’s so-called immorality and the social and economic harm that it can cause.Gambling is essentially a game of chance or hazard. While in the past it was viewed as recreation and entertainment—it remains so across many countries—more recent scholarly studies increasingly view the motives for gambling as highly complex.

Nepal’s stock market responded positively to it, triggering a bull run and circuit breaks on Sunday’s trade, the first day of trading after the policy announcement. The Nepal Stock Exchange Index crossed the 2,700 mark after 29 months.The market seemed to have responded positively to the abolition of the Rs200 million ceiling to institutional investors in margin-type lending by the bank and financial institutions, an extension of the loan repayment period for the construction businesses by the end of December 2024, and provision for uncollateralised loans to those going for foreign employment, among others. These, indeed, are more reactive than well-thought-out sustainable policy responses that are unlikely to deliver desirable impacts on containing the severe recessionary trends faced by the economy.Monetary policy-makingFor decades now, Nepal’s monetary policy formulation has been a ritual orchestration rather than a substantive assertion of legally empowered independence by the NRB. The first compromise on monetary policy independence emanated from the fact that the Nepali currency is strictly pegged with the Indian currency. Pragmatically, the pluses of this arrangement may outweigh the minuses for the Nepali economy, so policymakers are not even considering discontinuing it.First, according to the universally acclaimed monetary theory of the impossible trinity, “a country can’t have a fixed exchange rate, independent monetary policy, and free capital movement all at once”. This means that no monetary policy can be ‘independent’ as long as it is pegged with any other currency. But we continue to embrace this impossibility.Second, the central bank shoulders three distinct responsibilities: Controlling inflation, ensuring financial sector stability through supervision and regulation, and, for all practical purposes, functioning as the government's key development finance agency. This reality has often obviated the NRB from an undivided focus on the 'core' central banking functions of money supply, inflation targeting and aversion to systemic risk.Third, the monetary authority and the monetary policy it brings out are often burdened with undue expectations beyond their jurisdiction and capacity. For example, a monetary policy is expected to come out with stimulus packages to ‘rescue’ the economy reeling down the recession, which could be appropriately addressed only by a bold and creative fiscal policy. The monetary policy can only complement this endeavour by managing financial resources for the same.Fourth and the saddest of all, the central bank is exhausting all its autonomy and energy in utterly un-innovative ritualisation of the tasks it should have shed decades ago. For instance, the directed lending policies in the name of the priority sector, deprived sector or the schemes aimed at financial inclusion should no longer be part of monetary policy since they may give rise to a conflict of interests between the roles of a regulator and concessional development financer. The most striking ambiguity of the sort is manifested in the NRB dilemma in dealing with microfinance institutions.The missesThe Monetary Policy appeared as if the central bank was unaware of the current economic malaise and the sources of recalcitrant stagnation. One major sector where the banks have over-invested in the past and suffocated at present is real estate. Except for raising the credit limit from 50 to 70 percent of the valuation to the homeowners with a ‘proven tax file’, the policy has left the land and housing entrepreneurs completely at bay. With India reducing duties on gold imports by 9 percent, as announced in the country’s annual budget last week, the gold market in Nepal, for better or worse, is going to be impacted differently. It will have a bearing on both investment and foreign exchange reserves. The new monetary policy grossly overlooks this phenomenon.Despite repeating a decade-old idea of setting up a second-tier oversight institution to regulate the saving and credit cooperatives and streamlining the operations of the microfinance institutions, the policy has blatantly failed to reinvigorate the small-and-medium-enterprise (SME) ecosystem. At present, the SMEs of Nepal face a grave crisis of legal/official recognition that has, in turn, impeded their access to formal financing mechanisms.The Economic Census of Nepal 2018 has shown that out of 923,356 establishments, only 462,605, or 50.1 percent, are registered. The rest—49.9 percent—have no legal identity. These are important entities providing self-employment and livelihood support to a large population. However, they have hardly any scope to find sizable investments and scale up their operations to enable them to reap the benefits of economies of scale. Again, it must not be misconstrued that the central bank should be directly involved in financing these SMEs. However, as a policy-maker, it should make functional arrangements by engaging relevant stakeholders like the subnational governments to facilitate and recognise grassroots businesses. This reflects the glaring gap in the public policymaking mindset that devolved financial power under federal polity can help optimise implementation, including monetary policy.Flimsy approachSome haphazard and over-ambitious policies have only eroded the central bank’s credibility as the regulator. A provision not to blacklist the contractors deliberately issuing bank checks without adequate balance in their accounts is in direct contravention of the best universal practices in banking.The monetary policy proposes to support the government in achieving an economic growth rate of 6 percent, as proposed by the budget of the current fiscal year, through liquidity management and credit disbursement towards the productive sector. It projects the broad money supply to be at 12.0 percent and credit disbursement to the private sector to grow at 12.5 percent. This means an increase of about Rs660 billion from the current Rs5.3 trillion disbursements of loans.The target is clearly to invest about Rs700 billion worth of loanable funds now lying idle in the system. This is a huge ask considering that during 11 months of the last fiscal year, loans from banks to the private sector increased only by 5.1 percent.The policy also fails to address the risk of alarmingly increasing non-performing assets in the banking system, making the banks more hesitant to invest aggressively. Such policy orchestration does not support the wider agenda of overdue structural reform of the financial system.  ","summary":"The Monetary Policy for Fiscal Year 2024-25 issued last Friday by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the monetary authority of Nepal, is generally hailed as expansionary.

Several top UML leaders, including party Chairman KP Oli and others, have also vowed to contest the election single-handedly.The Maoist Centre contested local, provincial, and federal elections in alliances with the UML in 2017 and the Nepali Congress in 2022.A meeting of the party’s office bearers that concluded on Tuesday decided to contest the next elections single-handedly, said party spokesperson Agni Sapkota. “It was our conclusion that due to alliances with other political parties, we suffered a lot on ideological and organisational fronts,” Sapkota said.During the office bearers meeting, several party leaders criticised the leadership for failing to connect with the general public in the last nine years. The Maoist Centre has been continuously in power for nine years, partnering with the Nepali Congress or the UML. Dahal was recently unseated by Oli, who was appointed prime minister on July 14.In the party meeting, Dahal accused Oli of deceiving him. “I decided to join hands with UML with pure emotion and sentiment, but Oli betrayed us,” Dahal said in the party meeting while apprising the officer bearers of the problems that the party is facing, national and international situation and future strategy of the party.“In order to achieve the goal of socialism, we must keep on putting in our best efforts and should try to bring the communists, left, and socialist forces together.”In the four-day meeting, most of the leaders criticised Dahal for being power hungry, negotiating with Congress and UML to stay in power, and for making several hollow statements, like the one where he said he would bring upheaval in national politics through the party’s “magic” number.“When we contest the elections under the alliance, we have to prioritise the agenda of the other parties with whom we align,” Sapkota said. “That is why we could not communicate our agenda to the people, so we have now decided to contest the elections single-handedly, so that we can establish our political direction and perspective.”Some party leaders also cited the weakness of the party leadership. Dahal has been leading the party for almost four decades. “If given a chance, we are ready to lead the party,” said Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the party’s vice chairman. Almost all office bearers who spoke in the meeting stated that the party has lost its organisational base and ideological attraction and has become power-hungry while failing to address the grievances of the general public.“We have decided to go to the public and highlight the good works done by the Dahal government,” Sapkota said.He added that they would pressure the government to control corruption.Almost all party leaders stated during the meeting that due to an excessive focus on power, the party had lost its connection with the general public and failed to address the grievances and demands of the people.“People loved the alliance between the UML and the Maoist Centre, but the UML deceived us,” said Sapkota. “Though people liked the alliance between the two communist parties, we could not protect the unity, and now they deceived us and formed another alliance with the Nepali Congress.”Though the party’s leadership stated that it would contest the coming elections single-handedly, the party would also continue advancing the Socialist Front. Some fringe parties who identify themselves as leftist and socialist forces have come under the banner of the Socialist Front led by the Maoist Centre.Speaking with reporters in Dang on Tuesday, Shankar Pokhrel, the general secretary of the UML, said that “the drama in the name of left unity” has been over forever. Unity among the left parties has become a “folktale,” he said, “and we are not going to travel the same old route. The time has come for polarisation in politics, so we have to establish a two-party system. One front should be led by the Congress and the other by the UML.”But the Maoist leadership is still hopeful of left unity. “We have to work towards the reorganisation of the communist parties,” Sapkota said. “We have to widen the scope of the Socialist Front so that we can achieve the goal of the left unity.”The party has also decided to stay in opposition and play an effective role as an opposition party in the parliament, he added.Moreover, the Maoist Centre chair Dahal would take a nationwide tour soon to understand the attitude of the general public towards the party. “The party chair will undertake the nationwide tour in order to listen to the grievances of the people,” Sapkota said. “The relations between the general public and the party have broken down, and this is the right time to go for the public.”Dahal will undertake the nationwide tour after the conclusion of the party’s central committee meeting, which starts on August 10.During Tuesday’s meeting, some leaders expressed their interest in taking the helm of the party, Sapkota said, but “there is no alternative to Dahal at this moment.”Besides the party’s vice president, Shrestha, other senior party leaders like Janardan Sharma and Barshaman Pun, among others, have expressed their interest to lead the party, but they have failed to challenge Dahal’s leadership yet.

Officials at the Public Construction Department under the metropolis said that the contractor resumed the work after the High Court, Patan issued an interim order paving the way for following an interim order from the High Court, Patan allowing the work to proceed. “Now there is no obstruction from locals nor from federal government agencies,” said Baburam Bhattarai, a member of the City Planning Commission under the KMC. “We hope that the project will be completed at the earliest.”The metropolis had awarded a contract to widen the sidewalks by 1.5 metres along both sides of the road section between the New Road gate and the Juddha Statue roundabout in the last fiscal year. The work started in the New Road area in May, but a jurisdictional dispute between the city office and the Road Division, Kathmandu, caused the project to come to a halt. The division confiscated contractors’ equipment, and the federal government deployed police in to prevent the city office from working. Some local residents, too, had demonstrated against the pavement widening plan. The division had even repaired the parts of roads cut for pavement expansion.And on June 9, the metropolis moved the High Court challenging the breach of jurisdiction by the road division, which is a federal agency, and its intervention in the city’s work.City officials were already frustrated by the years-long delay by federal agencies in completing another project, the widening of Kathmandu’s Ring Road in the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section, which has caused huge inconvenience to the public due to dust and mud.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed city officials to dump truckloads of dirt from the Ring Road section in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office at Minbhawan, accusing federal agencies of delaying the work.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years due to Covid and delays in clearing the power poles and in some cases structures along the right of way.Regarding the jurisdiction dispute over the sidewalk widening work in the city, a division bench of judges Dhurba Raj Nand and Prakash Kharel at the High Court Patan issued an interim order in favour of the metropolis on Sunday.The City office has already widening pavements by 1 metre on both sides in the Bhrikutimandap area. “Neither did the federal government agency intervene, nor did locals object while expanding pavement in the Bhrikutimandap area by narrowing the road,” said Bhattarai. “Further decisions on pavement widening in other areas like Thamel, Handigaun and others will be taken after collecting public feedback.”Officials said that the long-term plan is to restrict motor vehicles altogether in the New Road area due to heavy pedestrian traffic. “We have also been working to find a solution to the parking problem and weighing various options including setting up multi-storey parking facilities,” said Bhattarai, who is also an urban planner.Officials said that pavements in the New Road area, which always remain crowded, should be widened to ensure free pedestrian movement. Officials claimed that New Road residents have also requested the city office to expand the pavement.According to city officials, local residents have, from time to time, complained about feeling unsafe and experiencing sexual harassment on the narrow and crowded sidewalks.

Officials said the move aims to ensure smooth transfer of waste as roads to the landfill often become impassable during the monsoon, preventing the passage of garbage trucks.“We have deployed three excavators, two bulldozers and two loaders to clear landslide debris along the road to the Bancharedanda landfill,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. “Also, we have kept five more vehicles on standby for immediate deployment if needed.”Every year, during monsoon season, the road to landfill sites gets obstructed in multiple places, obstructing the transfer of house waste collected in the three districts of the capital city—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Apart from these, some local levels of Kavrepalanchok also discard garbage at the landfill site at Bancharedanda.The metropolis officials said that they had purchased 10 high-pressure pumps to drain floodwaters from inundated settlements.“Five pumps have already been sent to the high-risk areas along riversides,” said Shrestha. “These can quickly pump away floodwaters.”The city office started repairing the Sisdole road leading to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district just a few weeks before the start of the monsoon. Officials said Rs30 million had been allocated for repairs, which included fixing potholes, concreting roads, and other works.Around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised, according to officials.Besides monsoon-induced road obstructions, garbage disposal is sometimes disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions cause weeks-long halt to door-to-door garbage collection, leading people in the Valley to discard their trash on streets.Officials said that a high-pressure pump is being used to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground.Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The City office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.The city office recently sold non-degradable waste worth Rs700,000.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled.

Health facilities across the country have been grappling with a surge in water- and vector-borne diseases. “Infection of the dengue virus has not risen this time compared to the previous years,” said Ghimire. “Ongoing rain has contaminated drinking water sources which increases the risk of potential outbreaks of waterborne diseases in the coming days.”According to data provided by the division, among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases at 249, followed by Jhapa 130, Chitwan 105, Tanahun 87, Makawanpur 78, Kaski 74, Bhojpur 62, Kavrepalanchok 60, and Okhaldhunga with 59 cases.Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated.

Active cholera surveillance is being carried out from 27 health facilities in Kathmandu Valley and 10 in Kailali district.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snakebites—in the coming days.The Ministry of Health and Population last month urged provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season and step up vigilance about the potential risks.Officials say that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks and directed agencies concerned to stockpile essential medicines.Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection.

This is not the first time coverage rate of a healthcare campaign has exceeded 100 percent.What concerns public health experts is that even if the coverage of the health campaign exceeds 100 percent every time, post-campaign surveys reveal actual coverage falling short.“We don’t have the exact count of the floating population or those living in the city slums,” said Dr Arjun Spkota, chief of Health Office Kathmandu. “Moreover there are refugees in the capital. Providing healthcare programmes to these groups is always a challenge. Chances of children missing vaccination or other health campaigns is always high in big and crowded cities like in the Kathmandu Valley.”Health authorities launched a special immunisation programme in the three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur and in Bhaktapur—following the detection of a highly contagious poliovirus in sewage samples.Officials say that presence of type-3 poliovirus in sewage samples has been confirmed by the National Institute of Health of Thailand, a World Health Organisation’s collaborating centre. The virus, which originated from a vaccine, was detected in sewage samples collected from the confluence of the Tukucha and Bagmati Rivers [in Kathmandu] on May 26, according to them.Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but was officially declared polio-free by the World Health Organisation only on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After having zero human cases of polio for about 14 years, the infectious disease has surfaced in the capital city’s sewage, which is a serious problem, according to public health officials. They said that the presence of poliovirus in sewage samples indicates the looming risk of an outbreak.The Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services had planned to carry out a four-day polio vaccination in all three districts of the Valley from July 24 but later extended for a week.All children under five years of age have been inoculated with an additional dose of oral polio vaccine in the drive.Oral polio vaccine, which consists of Type-1 and Type-3 polioviruses have been administered during the campaign. Health workers and female community health volunteers were deployed to homes, schools, bus parks, and entry points to ensure that no eligible children miss the vaccine. “We found over 3,000 children living in city slums,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section. “We are aware that children might still miss the vaccine despite our best efforts to meet the target.”The health ministry said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country. An estimated 300,000 children live in three districts of the Valley. But the 104 percent coverage rate shows that more children reside in the Valley than estimated. Health authorities do not have exact data on the people residing in the city slums. Floating population, scattered slums, high density of working-class people, and lack of awareness and poor access to health services are some of the challenges identified in improving health indicators, experts say. They urge the authorities to focus on high-risk groups when designing health programs, as vulnerable populations are always disproportionately affected during disease outbreaks.Doctors say the poliovirus mainly affects children and is usually transmitted through droplets or aerosols from the throat and by faecal contamination of hands, utensils, food and water. Those who do not wash their hands properly, and those who consume contaminated food and water or reside in an area where water and sanitation conditions are poor are at high risk of getting infected with the virus.Experts urge health authorities to carry out post-campaign surveys to know the actual coverage of the campaign.“Achieving 104 percent coverage is more of an administrative number,” said Upreti, former director general, who is also a child health expert. “Health authorities must carry out a post-campaign survey to reveal the true picture.”Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, boasting a high coverage rate. The country has made remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programmes are credited with this achievement.

Health authorities in most local units had stopped testing of drinking water just before the start of the monsoon season citing lack of funds, although deadly microbes such as faecal coliform and E coli were frequently detected in drinking water samples.Faecal coliform and E coli, both microscopic organisms, are found in human faeces. According to doctors, their presence of faecal coliform and E coli in drinking water means it is contaminated with sewage.“Ensuring water quality is a regular job and basic duty of the relevant agency,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Hospital. “Such essential services should not be halted under any conditions.”Doctors say bottled water is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley and is generally considered safe, but water quality of several companies have been found questionable. Presence of dangerous microbes in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.A combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors.The World Health Organisation also said that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths.

Ekata Vyas, who campaigns on behalf of the Nepali students—estimated to number at least 60—told the Post that she is hoping for positive results this time. She has received positive feedback and responses from New Delhi and the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu. The monthly stipend ranges from IRs 90,000 to 1,20,000.Besides taking up the matter, the foreign national doctors, mostly from Nepal, took up the issue before 2011. According to the Nepali doctors who are serving in AIIMS, a case was filed in the Delhi High Court against the discriminatory provision over the stipends and arrears in 2011. The Delhi Court gave its verdict in favour of the students on July 16. In 2013, however, the AIIMS filed a counter case which was made absolute on December 4, 2017, after 27 hearings, most of them just formalities marked by absences on the bench and of defendants. A Nepali student said that since they did not have the time and resources to follow up on the case in court, it was dismissed. “Then, we started discussing the matter with government officials and diplomats,” said the student.During the Nepal visit of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi in 2018, then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli also took up the matter with the Indian delegation.“Then we came to know that the India prime minister's office directed the Ministry of External Affairs to look into the matter and expedite its resolution. The Indian Embassy in Kathmandu also confirmed to India’s Ministry of External Affairs that Indian students in similar courses are getting stipends equal to their Nepali counterparts from their respective institutions in Nepal. In May 2018, India’s Ministry of External Affairs wrote to the Ministry of Health and Family Affairs to examine and expedite the prime minister’s directive.Then, India’s health ministry wrote to AIIMS, the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JPIMER), and the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, seeking the details of the foreign national residents.“It is pertinent to note that esteemed institutions such as JIPMER and PGIMER have already rectified similar issues by ensuring stipend payments to their Foreign National Residents as early as 2020. AIIMS, renowned for its commitment to excellence and equity, cannot afford to lag behind in such matters of principle. As representatives of the RDA, we assert that the workload and dedication of Foreign National Residents are equivalent to their peers who receive stipends,” the RDA stated in its letter to the AIIMS director.After two premier health institutions started providing the stipends in April 2020, the Resident Doctors Association of AIIMS wrote to the Prime Minister's Office in India seeking its intervention and solidarity with the foreign national residents who have been deprived of the stipends for the past decade.Again in May of the same year, the AIIMS association wrote to the AIIMS director to recognise the efforts by foreign national residents during the pandemic and consider resuming the stipend, but the request went unheard.In January 2023, the AIIMS issued a public notice stating that the government of Nepal should sponsor these students.Nepal’s foreign ministry then clarified that the Nepali students had competed openly and were selected on merit with no sponsorship or role of the government of Nepal.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. ","summary":"In a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu.

So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC.

While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon.

As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley "},{"hash":"c077b34beda2250a997231f215f178053a057340c5c72de0aec15b25ae40ddb7","title":"old-memories-and-new-realities-in-phidim","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/travel/2023/11/18/old-memories-and-new-realities-in-phidim","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2023/third-party/phidim%20main%20(1).JPG&w=900&height=601","date":1700265600000,"source":"kp","category":"travel","content":"Once again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution.

Hamas and Iran have both accused Israel of carrying out the assassination and have pledged to retaliate against their foe. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the death nor denied it.Haniyeh was laid to rest in a cemetery in the city of Lusail after a funeral ceremony at the Iman Mohamed Ibn Abd Al-Wahhab Mosque in Qatar’s capital Doha.His coffin, draped in the Palestinian flag, was carried in a procession past hundreds of people along with the casket of his bodyguard, who was killed in the same attack in Tehran on Wednesday. Mourners at the ceremony included Khaled Meshaal, who is tipped to be the new Hamas leader. Other senior Hamas officials and Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani also attended.Speaking at the mosque, where Haniyeh’s body was laid for prayers, Meshaal said his death would only make the group more determined to continue its fight for a free Palestine.

","summary":"Hamas’ top leader Ismail Haniyeh was buried in Qatar on Friday following his assassination in the Iranian capital Tehran, and his possible succcessor told mourners his death would only make the Palestinian militant group more determined in its struggle against Israel.Haniyeh’s death was one in a series of killings of senior Hamas figures as the war in Gaza between Hamas and Israel nears its 11th month and concern grows that the conflict is spreading across the Middle East. Hamas and Iran have both accused Israel of carrying out the assassination and have pledged to retaliate against their foe. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the death nor denied it.Haniyeh was laid to rest in a cemetery in the city of Lusail after a funeral ceremony at the Iman Mohamed Ibn Abd Al-Wahhab Mosque in Qatar’s capital Doha.His coffin, draped in the Palestinian flag, was carried in a procession past hundreds of people along with the casket of his bodyguard, who was killed in the same attack in Tehran on Wednesday. Mourners at the ceremony included Khaled Meshaal, who is tipped to be the new Hamas leader. Other senior Hamas officials and Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani also attended.Speaking at the mosque, where Haniyeh’s body was laid for prayers, Meshaal said his death would only make the group more determined to continue its fight for a free Palestine. There would be no concessions over its principles and no recognition of Israel, he said.“Palestine will remain from the river to the sea...and the Zionists (Israel) have no place on the land of Palestine, regardless of how many they kill of us,” Meshaal said in a video released by Hamas.Haniyeh’s death was a big loss to the movement but it would not alter their course, he said.“Our enemies don’t learn the lesson, they have been killing our leaders for over 100 years, what happened?

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. ","summary":"Bharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US.

When I was involved in expanding the work of the mangalbare discussion group of Chautari and in founding SINHAS, both in 1995, no one asked me what the business plans for these projects were. If anyone had asked, I would have had to tell them they did not exist. And if the existence of such plans were a prerequisite for these projects, they would have never taken off to become important platforms for public discourse and academic publications related to Nepal. I wrote about the discussion series in an earlier column of the Post (“Chautari guff at 32”, November 10, 2023).The idea of SINHAS emanated from a spontaneous proposal made by our publisher, Madhab Lal Maharjan, to me when I was visiting his shop, Mandala Book Point, some day in 1994. I made no immediate commitment to him. I returned to the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) in late 1994 to complete my doctoral dissertation. The final decision to start SINHAS was made in the summer of 1995 following conversations between Mary Des Chene, Mark Liechty and myself in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Lazima Onta-Bhatta was invited to join the team. We decided that each journal volume would consist of two issues—each about 200 pages thick—published in June and December of each year. Then, Madhab and we made a simple oral agreement: The editors would prepare the “camera-ready” copy of each issue, and he would publish, distribute and sell it. The first issue of SINHAS was published in August 1996. A “foolish” decisionReflecting on the decision to start SINHAS, I would say that it represented the collective “foolishness” of the four founding editors. How so?Think about the “standing” of the founding team in 1995: Here were four people, two of whom were early career post-PhD researchers, and the other two doctoral students still writing their dissertations. The most senior of the lot, Mary, had finished her PhD in anthropology from Stanford University in 1991 with a dissertation titled “Relics of Empire: A Cultural History of the Gurkhas, 1815-1987.” She published an article in the Himalayan Research Bulletin in 1992 and a second one in the South Asia Bulletin in 1993. In 1995, apart from teaching, she was crafting articles for other journals and edited volumes. She had published at least two book reviews in academic journals by then, and might have even peer-reviewed a manuscript or two for some journals.The second post-PhD researcher in our team, Mark Liechty, obtained his PhD in anthropology from UPenn in December 1994, writing a dissertation titled “Fashioning Modernity in Kathmandu: Mass Media, Consumer Culture, and the Middle Class in Nepal.” He had spent the first six months of 1995 as a postdoctoral fellow at the International Institute for Asian Studies in Leiden, the Netherlands. While there, he finished the final draft of his article, “Kathmandu as Translocality: Multiple Places in a Nepali Space,” published in 1996 in the edited volume Geography of Identity. Before going to Leiden, Mark finished another article on youth identities and the experience of modernity in Kathmandu, published in 1995 in the edited volume Youth Cultures: A Cross-Cultural Perspective. Hence, by mid-1995, although two of his articles in two separate edited volumes were in various stages of the pre-press process, Mark had not even submitted an article to a journal for review. He published a book review in 1993 but does not remember doing any official peer reviews for any journal until then.In July 1995, I was still a year away from finishing my PhD in history at UPenn. During the hot summer of 1995 in Philadelphia, I was writing my dissertation, “The Politics of Bravery: A History of Nepali Nationalism.” Some months earlier, I had published a full-length article under the title “Rich Possibilities: Notes on Social History in Nepal” in Contributions to Nepalese Studies, which was the most prominent journal of Nepal Studies at that time. That submission had not undergone a rigorous peer review process but was finely copy-edited before publication. By then, I had published reviews of academic books in three journals. Still, I had not done any official peer review of any article manuscript written by others for any journal. In the early summer of 1995, Lazima, the fourth founder of SINHAS, was still doing her anthropological fieldwork in Kathmandu on the subject of street children. At that time, she had not published anything in academic journals. Later that year, she returned to the US to begin writing her doctoral dissertation, which eventually got submitted to Cornell University in 2000 under the title “Street Children’s Subcultures and Cultural Politics of Childhood in Nepal.” So here was a group of four researchers—two early post-doctoral ones and two doctoral students—who had certainly read thousands of journal articles between them during their graduate training but whose collective experience of writing for academic journals was limited to just three published full-length articles in total! Three members of this group had never done an official peer review of any article manuscript submitted to any journal. None of them had worked as a proper editorial assistant in any academic journal team previously. In other disciplinary domains, early career researchers cut their journal editing teeth by working first as junior members of the editorial collective of some journals. Later on, they are offered associate and eventually full editorial positions in those same or other journals. But here was our team, deciding to establish a new journal of Nepal Studies without such experience. Surely, we were well read in Nepali history and society, but collectively, we had minimal knowledge of the intricate processes that generate academic journals. Hence, the decision to establish SINHAS was a “foolish” reflection of the collective youth and naivety of the four founding editors.Portable lessonsGiven its current standing among practitioners of Nepal Studies, I would have to say that SINHAS has done pretty well in its 29 years of existence despite not having a “business plan.” We have learnt to run the journal while securing and editing good articles that enhance our collective understanding of Nepali history and society. That raises this question: Does every project in life need a business plan? I clearly don’t think so. For many aspects of how a democratic society ought to function, we probably need individuals committed long-term to specific ideas and projects more than business plans for them. Such individuals should have the freedom to “foolishly” launch public-serving projects without worrying about business plans. I am glad that back in 1995, I did not have to respond to folks who were married to the idea of business plans for everything, whether a discussion forum or a journal. There should be ample room for spontaneity, public-serving naivety and experiential serendipity in any society that likes to call itself loktantrik.   ","summary":"Every time someone mentions “business plan,” I think about two of the major projects of my life—the discussion series run by Martin Chautari and the academic journal Studies in Nepali History and Society (SINHAS).

His distinct views (from Saeed Jalili’s, who lost the presidential election to Pezeshkian) divided the audience in the early second phase, influencing his supporters even more when the Taliban slid into the discussion from a meagre analogy.By the end of the second phase, many Iranians—especially from the Pezeshkian camp—had then considered Jalili to share ideological similarities with that of the Taliban. That being so, during our meeting with a political leader who served in the previous Rouhani government and advised Pezeshkian on foreign relations during the second phase of the presidential race, he vowed to prevent a Taliban-aligned administrator from forming the government. His statement not only reflected Jalili’s approach to the Taliban (if he became the administrator) but also severe apprehensions towards Iranian national security under his leadership. This statement can be interpreted in two ways: First, from a purely reformist perspective (emanating from the Pezeshkian camp), Jalili as an administrator was considered too extreme (even radical, according to some scholars), putting him in the same group as the Taliban with a desire to bring regional, perhaps even global instability. Though many in the Jalili camp disassociated these views, referring to them as meagre hearsay, some close to him and also those who voted for him discreetly acknowledged his views as ‘somewhat’ extreme. Second, the statement above also reflected Jalili’s intent to support the Taliban, perhaps establishing a functional relationship taking into account the Taliban’s 21-year campaign against the West—primarily the US—disregarding the threat posed by the group to Iranian national security, its territorial integrity/sovereignty or to local Iranians directly. Taking this discussion to Jalili’s camp, we spoke in great detail with political leaders and closest aides who described the Pezeshkian government ‘to be worse than that of Rouhani, risking regional instability in the first few months.’ Considering the aforementioned statements, we predict that the Pezeshkian administration will employ a different policy towards the Taliban government than that of the late former President Rouhani’s approach. Taking into account the nature of reformist governments, Pezeshkian’s administration may express little or no interest to support any radical/Islamic regime, particularly in the immediate neighbourhood, even if the entity is raising its flag against the West/US or their allies. With the Taliban echoed during the presidential race, it is highly likely for Pezeshkian to limit direct engagement with the group, at least during the first few months of his presidency. Similar reluctance appears to persist inside the Taliban’s Rahbari Shura, according to a Kabul-based journalist who engages with the Taliban’s MFA frequently. He opined on serious confusion and probable discontent with the Pezeshkian victory. Two Taliban leaders inside the Rahbari Shura expressed hope for strengthening and expanding relations between the two neighbours during the Pezeshkian administration, reflecting ambiguity and silence on the Taliban’s reservation over Pezeshkian’s victory. With the Rahbari Shura known to have closely monitored the outcome with great enthusiasm, Pezeshkian’s stance towards the group may have called for some reproachment in its policy towards Iran. This instigated profound dissatisfaction from a pragmatic neighbour with the possibility of even plunged ties with Tehran (during Pezeshkian’s presidency), reflecting severe mistrust weeks before his formal oath to power.That said, President-elect Pezeshkian can choose to adopt a different policy towards the Taliban, provided that his choice of cabinet receives blessings from the Supreme Leader. His cabinet will undergo serious vetting by the Office of the Supreme Leader or, to put it plainly, by Ali Khamenei himself. To understand the influence of the Supreme Leader, we spoke to a Tehran-based political leader who worked closely with the Late President Rouhani. He opined of a similar practice carried out by the late president, who, on one occasion, discussed the nomination of one particular political leader for a cabinet appointment with him, seeking the green light from the Supreme Leader himself. The statement above does not provide any substantial evidence to support the practice of seeking a green light from the Supreme Leader for the President’s cabinet. Indeed, it highlights the importance of seeking the Supreme Leader’s approval for matters of state. According to a Tehran-based expert, certain appointments explicitly call for a green light from the Office of the Supreme Leader. These include: Minister/public servants heading portfolios within domestic/foreign intelligence service, servants heading portfolios within the ministry of defence, servants heading portfolios within the ministry of interior and servants heading portfolios within the ministry of foreign affairs. Suppose the Pezeshkian administration decides to chart a course to re-establish a relationship with the West (it’s a big if); the bullwork would rest primarily on the cabinet member heading the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). As a set precedent, the Supreme Leader has always nominated the post of Foreign Minister to his preferred candidate, strengthening the ‘Axis of Resistance’ and synchronising the mandate of the MFA with that of the IRGC activities in the Middle East and beyond.As a principle, the foundation of Iran’s foreign policy can only be altered by the Supreme Leader, with IRGC providing strategic support to his decisions. According to one Tehran-based political leader, the responsibility of charting Iran’s Foreign Policy now rests with former nuclear negotiator Abbas Araqchi, the new Iran’s foreign minister. Even if, as a hypothesis, the President and his cabinet decide to alter Iran’s foreign policy in a positive direction, it will be forced to face the brunt of the IRGC.The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) can create serious hurdles for the Pezeshkian administration. It is a powerful force with the mandate of supporting ideologically aligned Islamic groups with a common goal of opposing the US and its allies. With the IRGC's growing engagement with the Taliban, particularly the GDI, it remains unclear how the Pezeshkian administration would put a check on the Guard Corp’s interaction with political leaders across the border. At this junction, it remains unclear if Pezeshkian’s administration could segregate strategic engagements from regional diplomacy with the intent to put a temporary stop to the IRGC's engagement with the Taliban.Only by successfully navigating the hurdles above does the Pezeshkian administration stand a chance of altering Iran’s Taliban policy since the latter came to power in 2021. If not, the Pezeshkian administration could retain the late President Rouhani’s policy towards the Taliban, which the Office of the Supreme Leader could emphasise. That said, even if the Supreme Leader does give the green light to an altered Taliban policy, expecting a substantial change would be hypothetical. It remains to be seen whether Pezeshkian will open doors of engagement based on realities in Tehran or Kabul or put forth the traditional stance of engaging with any Islamic group with hostilities against the US and its allies.Mishra is a visiting fellow at the International Centre for Policing and Security at the University of South Wales.

Appearing before the committee, the woman narrated how Pradhan had sexually abused her and why he was morally unfit to hold a respectable constitutional position.

Of course, you could argue that the panel had it easy as Pradhan had already pulled out of the race to be the commissioner when he realised that the woman had a strong case against him. Yet that would be a simplistic reading. The reason Pradhan pulled out was the intense scrutiny that the parliamentary hearing process had put him under. There are differing views on the relevance of parliamentary hearings in Nepal. The Constitutional Council, which picks the officials for constitutional bodies, is an all-powerful entity headed by the prime minister and comprising Speaker, National Assembly chair, chief justice, leader of the main opposition and deputy speaker. It involves not only heads of executive, legislative and judiciary but also that of the opposition party.

In 2020, when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister during his second term, he even changed the provisions of the Constitutional Council Act, just so he could make over four dozen appointments including heads and members of several constitutional bodies. The decision couldn’t be crosschecked at the hearing committee as Oli had already dissolved the House of Representatives. Lawyers challenged the move in the court but the issue is still sub-judice. It is only in a rare case that the House committee rejects the council’s recommendation. Pradhan’s rejection however is not the first. If the House wasn’t in session, Pradhan’s recommendation would have automatically been passed and he would have by now become an election commissioner. It is because the committee has a system to seek complaints, if any, from the public about the nominee that a victim could reach out to the lawmakers and inform them about his wrongdoings. Thus a wrong man has been stopped from holding an important position. The committee however over the years failed to gain public trust as it is seen as no more than a rubber-stamp of powerful leaders. It should be able to dispel such beliefs by taking more bold decisions. The goal, as some argue, should not be to do away with the parliamentary hearing altogether.

There is thus no easy way to make young Nepalis stay back in their own country, either to work or to study. The best the country can hope is that at least some of its youths who get a good education or valuable work experience abroad come back and do something worthwhile in their homeland. There are ways to encourage this trend. The national economy needs to grow at a decent clip, putting more disposable income in people’s hands and boosting enterprises and industries. More than that, having policy stability will allow businesses to plan long-term. It’s a virtuous cycle. Yet, even in the best-case scenario, a touch of realism is warranted: There is only so much a developing state like Nepal can do to keep its youth rooted in their country—if such a policy is advisable.Japan seems to be the new destination of choice for Nepali students. In the just-completed fiscal year, over 112,000 students obtained the ‘no objection certificates’ (NOCs) from the Ministry of Education. (Such letters are mandatory for Nepali students to study abroad.) The ministry issued over 34,000 NOCs for Japan, followed by over 15,000 for Canada, over 14,000 for Australia, over 13,000 for the UK, and a touch over 11,000 for the US. The appeal of Japan has been steadily rising as education there is relatively cheaper compared to studying in Western countries and a Nepali student in Japan can work for up to 28 hours a week. Interestingly, the high influx of foreign students has sparked a debate in Japan, traditionally a closed country, on the costs and benefits of accepting migrants of all kinds. Pretty much the same thing is happening in Australia, which has over the past year tightened its rules for foreign students. As Australia tightened its borders, Nepali students seem to have shifted to Japan. So, again, part of the reason Nepali students go abroad is undoubtedly economic. Yet it is far from the whole story. Rather than looking to keep young folks in the country at all costs, the goal could rather be to build a capable network of people of Nepali origin, wherever they are in the world, and harness this collective power for the country’s good. For instance, Nepalis in North America collaborated to push for the Nepal Open University, the distance learning public university established in 2016. As the gig economy takes off and studying online gains popularity, distance learning gives people the flexibility to juggle their study, work and other commitments. The potential for such collaboration is endless, if only the host country creates the right environment.

The same government, however, garnered praise in a matter of days when Prime Minister Oli appointed Lila Devi Badtaula as the Nepal government’s first female Chief Secretary. While undeniably historic in a country where men are at the forefront of leadership positions, it is difficult to ignore the political context surrounding Badtaula’s selection, which came amid a public outcry over the severe underrepresentation of women in the Cabinet. Her appointment at the end of her career and only when former chief secretary Baikuntha Aryal was suspended—outgoing Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal had appointed Badtaula an acting chief secretary on July 15—is suggestive of the disregard for having women in top positions when men are around. This raises questions about whether Badtaula’s promotion was no more than a tactical move to quell public discontent. The prime minister, silent about the biases in Cabinet, boasted on Facebook on Saturday, “I saw many friends writing about Nepali women who have reached high leadership positions on social media yesterday. I am also pleased with these four coincidences that became possible under my positive initiative”. The pictures showed the first female President, Bidhya Devi Bhandari; the first female Chief Justice, Sushila Karki; the first woman speaker in the House of Representatives, Onsari Gharti; and Badtaula—all of whom were appointed during Oli’s government leadership at different times. We also have another unforgettable name Sewa Lamsal (the first female foreign secretary), at present.

And apart from politics, as per the Department of National Personnel Records, out of 85,513 civil service employees, 20.64 percent are female; seven are secretaries besides the chief secretary. Even so, genuine gender equality and inclusion is far from ensured. These seemingly “historic” achievements, each carrying the tag “the first woman,” however, fail to represent a whole lot of Nepali women. It is uncertain whether more women will consistently fill the positions left by their ‘female firsts’. As concerning is the exclusion of women from marginalised communities in the top roles, where the Khas-Arya dominate.Things won’t improve much unless more women are elected through first-past-the-post or direct elections—in the 2022 elections just nine women were directly elected—and unless women stopped being played as token cards. And this will never come without political leaders’ willingness to change. As men dominate Nepali politics, women are “given” positions. Tokenism will never lead to women’s empowerment and equality; it will in fact prove detrimental to the realisation of our gender-equal dreams. True gender equality requires more than symbolic gestures; it demands substantive change in our behaviour in how we treat women both at home and in public positions. As of yet, political positions are seen as something that only men can handle, and women are largely sidelined or dismissed. Because of this, not many women aspire to be politicians or top administrators.
