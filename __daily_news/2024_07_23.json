The Embassy of Japan hopes that these hospitals will continue to lead the medical and healthcare sector in Nepal towards the goal of providing quality healthcare to its citizens.\n"},{"hash":"44d805812b2c613f524306f40e4e703700e3d637b9b21b52c3aeeb3f2440ca16","title":"calls-over-ridges-nepal-distributes-nutritious-lunch-program-and-scholarships-to-khiji-demba-students","date":1720569600000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/health/calls-over-ridges-nepal-distributes-nutritious-lunch-program-and-scholarships-to-khiji-demba-students","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/WhatsApp_Image_2024_07_10_at_161720609435_1024.jpg","category":"health","content":"\nCalls Over Ridges Nepal (CORN), with the financial support of Be Global Foundation and Calls Over Ridges headquarters, has distributed nutritious lunch programs and scholarships to secondary schools in Khiji Demba Rural Municipality.

Official data showed that the country continues to be dependent on fossil fuel despite the surge in electric vehicles (EVs) and more electricity generation.The imports of three oil products—diesel, kerosene, and liquified petroleum gas—have dropped by Rs15.36 billion combined, mainly in terms of value.A breakdown of the oil import bills shows diesel imports dropped by 6.36 percent to Rs143.97 billion, which translates to a decrease of Rs9.79 billion. However, in terms of quantity, Nepal imported 1.41 million kilolitres of diesel in the last fiscal year, a marginal drop of 2,946 kilolitres compared to the previous fiscal year's imports. (1 kilolitre = 1,000 litres).Similarly, petrol imports in terms of value dropped by Rs1.25 billion to Rs68.1 billion in the last fiscal year. But in terms of quantity, imports increased by 7,124 kilolitres to 687,931 kilolitres. Likewise, imports of liquified petroleum gas, popularly known as cooking gas, dropped by Rs2.53 billion to Rs55.61 billion. But the quantity of imports increased by 9,863 tonnes to 524,204 tonnes.“From no angle can we say that the rise in electricity generation and adoption of EVs have cut down on petroleum consumption,” said Manoj Kumar Thakur, spokesperson of Nepal Oil Corporation. “Petroleum prices jumped because of the Russia-Ukraine war that started in February 2022,” he said. Due to the price factor, the oil monopoly had to curtail imports in the previous fiscal year, and this was visible in the reduced imports. Thakur said that the petrol price, which had reached Rs190 per litre two years ago, has now come down to Rs171 per litre.According to a recent economic survey, Nepal is gradually moving toward becoming energy self-sufficient. As of mid-March, 97.7 percent of the population had access to electricity, while the country’s total electricity output had reached 3,060 MW. Since 2021, the country started producing surplus power, especially in the wet season. Nepal began exporting power to India in November 2021. Between June 1 and December 6, 2023, Nepal sold electricity worth Rs15.4 billion to India.Analysts say that despite being a clean energy surplus, the use of fossil fuels that produce hazardous air pollutants, including sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and carbon monoxide, have been rising.According to the Department of Customs, imports of electric vehicles (EVs) jumped to Rs30.77 billion in the last fiscal year from Rs12.60 billion in the previous fiscal year. Despite the dramatic growth in EV imports, imports of fossil fuel, however, have been rising. Thakur said that though EV imports are rising, the demand for combustion vehicles that burn fossil fuels has remained strong. “Petrol imports will decrease if EVs are imported for mass transport.” However, the drop in petroleum, fertiliser, and cereal imports has reduced Nepal’s overall international trade, which has dropped for the second consecutive year after peaking in 2022. Nepal’s trade, combined imports and exports, dropped by 1.33 percent to Rs1.74 trillion in the fiscal year 2023-2024, or Rs23.50 billion.According to analysts, the downturn reflects a slowdown in economic activities. The downturn was driven by a fall in imports, which dropped by 1.16 percent to Rs1.59 trillion, translating to a decrease of Rs18.74 billion. The country’s exports, too, fell by 3.03 percent to Rs152.38 billion, a reduction of Rs4.75 billion in the review period.Trade experts said Nepal’s attempt to save foreign exchange by strangling imports nearly suffocated the economy in the previous fiscal year. Worried by rapidly receding foreign currency reserves and growing trade imbalance, the government in April 2022 banned the import of a slew of luxury goods.The embargo, which lasted till December 2022, worked all too well. It had the desired effect of squeezing the bloated trade deficit, but it also caused the economy to slow down dangerously to a near stall.Trade experts said the ad hoc decision to slam the brakes on imports put the country into total disarray in the previous fiscal year. The annual growth rate sank to a new low, and Nepal plunged into its first recession in six decades in the first two quarters.Nepal’s foreign trade shrank by 16.58 percent to Rs1.76 trillion in the previous fiscal year. Imports fell by 16.08 percent to Rs1.61 trillion, while exports dropped by 21.44 percent to Rs157 billion. An official at the National Statistics Office said that as Nepal is now an import-driven economy, any contraction in trade activities will hurt the economy.A country’s import and export activities can influence its GDP.When a country imports goods, it represents an outflow of funds. “A high level of imports, mainly productive assets, such as machinery and equipment, indicates robust domestic demand and a growing economy,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the National Statistics Office. “Importing industrial machines is more favourable for a country since productive assets will improve the economy’s productivity over the long run. But the statistics show a drop in the import of industrial machinery, which is worrisome.”“But there is something to cheer about. The import of petrol and diesel, Nepal's top import commodities, has dropped,” said Regmi. Cereal imports dropped to Rs45.79 billion from Rs56.62 billion due to India's ban. However, industry insiders say the prohibition was costly for Nepalis, as food prices jumped significantly in the last fiscal year.  ","summary":"Nepal’s petroleum imports dropped by 4.35 percent to Rs337.34 billion in the last fiscal year ended July 15, due to lower international rates. Official data showed that the country continues to be dependent on fossil fuel despite the surge in electric vehicles (EVs) and more electricity generation.The imports of three oil products—diesel, kerosene, and liquified petroleum gas—have dropped by Rs15.36 billion combined, mainly in terms of value.A breakdown of the oil import bills shows diesel imports dropped by 6.36 percent to Rs143.97 billion, which translates to a decrease of Rs9.79 billion. However, in terms of quantity, Nepal imported 1.41 million kilolitres of diesel in the last fiscal year, a marginal drop of 2,946 kilolitres compared to the previous fiscal year's imports. (1 kilolitre = 1,000 litres).Similarly, petrol imports in terms of value dropped by Rs1.25 billion to Rs68.1 billion in the last fiscal year. But in terms of quantity, imports increased by 7,124 kilolitres to 687,931 kilolitres. Likewise, imports of liquified petroleum gas, popularly known as cooking gas, dropped by Rs2.53 billion to Rs55.61 billion. But the quantity of imports increased by 9,863 tonnes to 524,204 tonnes.“From no angle can we say that the rise in electricity generation and adoption of EVs have cut down on petroleum consumption,” said Manoj Kumar Thakur, spokesperson of Nepal Oil Corporation. “Petroleum prices jumped because of the Russia-Ukraine war that started in February 2022,” he said. Due to the price factor, the oil monopoly had to curtail imports in the previous fiscal year, and this was visible in the reduced imports. Thakur said that the petrol price, which had reached Rs190 per litre two years ago, has now come down to Rs171 per litre.According to a recent economic survey, Nepal is gradually moving toward becoming energy self-sufficient. As of mid-March, 97.7 percent of the population had access to electricity, while the country’s total electricity output had reached 3,060 MW. Since 2021, the country started producing surplus power, especially in the wet season. Nepal began exporting power to India in November 2021. Between June 1 and December 6, 2023, Nepal sold electricity worth Rs15.4 billion to India.Analysts say that despite being a clean energy surplus, the use of fossil fuels that produce hazardous air pollutants, including sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and carbon monoxide, have been rising.According to the Department of Customs, imports of electric vehicles (EVs) jumped to Rs30.77 billion in the last fiscal year from Rs12.60 billion in the previous fiscal year. Despite the dramatic growth in EV imports, imports of fossil fuel, however, have been rising. Thakur said that though EV imports are rising, the demand for combustion vehicles that burn fossil fuels has remained strong. “Petrol imports will decrease if EVs are imported for mass transport.” However, the drop in petroleum, fertiliser, and cereal imports has reduced Nepal’s overall international trade, which has dropped for the second consecutive year after peaking in 2022. Nepal’s trade, combined imports and exports, dropped by 1.33 percent to Rs1.74 trillion in the fiscal year 2023-2024, or Rs23.50 billion.According to analysts, the downturn reflects a slowdown in economic activities. The downturn was driven by a fall in imports, which dropped by 1.16 percent to Rs1.59 trillion, translating to a decrease of Rs18.74 billion. The country’s exports, too, fell by 3.03 percent to Rs152.38 billion, a reduction of Rs4.75 billion in the review period.Trade experts said Nepal’s attempt to save foreign exchange by strangling imports nearly suffocated the economy in the previous fiscal year. Worried by rapidly receding foreign currency reserves and growing trade imbalance, the government in April 2022 banned the import of a slew of luxury goods.The embargo, which lasted till December 2022, worked all too well. It had the desired effect of squeezing the bloated trade deficit, but it also caused the economy to slow down dangerously to a near stall.Trade experts said the ad hoc decision to slam the brakes on imports put the country into total disarray in the previous fiscal year.

A potential shortage of these items will lead to a rise in unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions and maternal and neonatal deaths.Multiple officials at the Ministry of Health complained that it has been too difficult to convince officials at the Finance Ministry about the importance of family planning programmes.“Most officials think that the country’s population witnessed the lowest growth in eight decades, so continuation of family planning programmes is not necessary,” an official at the Health Ministry said on condition of anonymity, as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “But decline in population growth rate and providing family planning services are totally two different things.”Nepal’s population growth rate stood at 0.92 percent per annum in the past decade, according to officials.“The growth rate of the population has declined due to various factors, including internal and external migration,” said Dr Prakash Dev Panta, a demographer. “However, the fertility rate has not declined. If authorities stop family planning services, then again unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and maternal and neonatal deaths will rise, which have reduced over the years after making huge investments in the programmes.”The UNFPA’s “State of World Population 2022” report titled, “Seeing the Unseen”, says half of the 1.2 million pregnancies in 2017 in Nepal were unintended and nearly 359,000 were aborted.“Unintended pregnancy is a reality for millions each year, accounting for nearly half of all pregnancies,” said the UNFPA’s report. “Sixty percent of these unintended pregnancies will end in abortion.”The UN agency’s report stated that the toll of these pregnancies is—and has for long been—unseen. “Though we can estimate healthcare costs, monitor school dropout rates and project levels of workforce attrition due to unintended pregnancies, these only scratch the surface. No number could adequately represent the loss of life, agency and human capital that results from unintended pregnancies,” the report added.Unintended pregnancy is often, tragically, linked to violence. The report shows how unintended pregnancies result in additional social and fiscal burdens, including greater demand for healthcare, unsafe abortion, loss of income and productivity, fewer resources for children in a family, and more fraught and unstable family relationships. Experts say that family planning services are directly linked to women's empowerment and the country's economic growth.Every year, around 100,000 women undergo abortions in Nepal at legally authorised clinics and health facilities. Gynaecologists, however, say the actual number of abortions could be several times more than the government figure, as all abortions do not get reported, especially medical abortions.Experts say halting family planning services abruptly will also be against the commitment of the government to enabling women and couples to attain the desired family size and have a healthy spacing of childbirths. This commitment includes improving access to rights-based family planning services and reducing the unmet need for contraceptives.Last year, too, the Health Ministry, due to a fund crunch, borrowed 50,000 contraceptive implants from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).

A powerful government is in the interest of the country that has been reeling under economic crisis, unemployment and other problems. However, securing an overwhelming House majority at the start of the term is nothing new for a Nepali prime minister. CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who secured over 97 percent votes in the House in January 2023, had to go for the floor test three more times before he was ousted earlier this month. In the fourth vote, he was supported by only 22 percent of the members of the same House.When KP Sharma Oli became prime minister for the second time in February 2018, he returned to Singhadurbar with a strong mandate as the erstwhile left alliance of the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre) won a resounding majority in the 2017 general elections. In May the same year, they converted the left alliance into a single unified party making Oli a strong prime minister, commanding an overwhelming majority in the federal parliament. But this unified force fell apart and the two mother parties were revived in March 2021.

We are really in uncharted waters for American politics.So, how where does the race go from here—and what does it mean for both the Democrats and Donald Trump, the Republican nominee?Will Democrats support Harris?Biden has endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, as the nominee, which I believe he was always going to do. Not anointing Harris as his successor would have been politically unthinkable for Biden simply because it would have undermined his own decision-making when he chose her to be his running mate before the 2020 election.His endorsement will also have a big impact on the decision-making of the Democratic Party as a whole. Anybody who challenges Harris now might well be taking on the establishment of the party. And the party would be wary of increasing perceptions of disunity at this point.So, it certainly seems the Democrats will unite behind her as the candidate.That said, it’s not out of the realm of possibility that she could be challenged by another presidential hopeful. This may well depend on her performance – and the broader reactions to her—in the next couple of days.Potential rivals will have political ambitions of their own—we can’t discount that.There will also be significant calculations about whether Harris can do the job—if she can win a national election campaign against Trump. Unfortunately, there’s a lot of wariness in the United States about what it would mean to be have a Black woman running against Trump, and how that would be received.And lastly, there is a lot of very real angst within the Democratic Party—and more broadly—about what a Trump victory would mean for the country. In many people’s views, the best way to avert what Democrats see as a potential catastrophe is to nominate the candidate with the best chance of beating him. Whether or not the party settles on Harris as that person remains to be seen.Risks and rewardsThe risks are quite obvious. There’s a real wariness about the unprecedented nature of this decision and how it will rattle the party.One risk is Harris turns out not to be the right candidate and that the presidential race would be difficult for her to win, especially given how badly her first campaign for the presidency went in 2020.The risks to American politics more broadly are also quite serious, given the level of vitriol and hatred that will be directed at the Democratic Party if a Black woman is the head of the ticket.But I think it’s also entirely possible this is the circuit breaker the Democrats needed. The party had been slipping into a morass of despair after Biden’s debate performance against Trump last month and the subsequent assassination attempt against the former president. In a recent poll, two-thirds of Democrats said they believed Biden should withdraw from the race.Given that both Biden and Trump are so disliked by the American population, Harris (and her running mate) could represent a huge opportunity for the Democrats.A key strength of Harris is on the critical issue of reproductive rights. She has owned this issue in the campaign so far because Biden has difficulty with abortion politically as a devout Catholic—and we saw how he struggled with the messaging on this issue in the debate.It’s entirely possible it will be a hugely mobilising factor in this year’s election, as it was in the 2022 midterm elections. As such, Harris would have a significant advantage in persuading the Democratic base to turn out to vote on that issue, in addition to other voters.Calculations for TrumpAssuming Harris does become the nominee, Trump’s pick of J.D. Vance as his vice presidential running mate may turn out to have been a mistake. Like much of the movement that supports Trump, Vance is virulently anti-abortion and committed to further regulations on reproductive rights.This could be a significant vulnerability for Trump, who doesn’t perform as well with women voters compared to men.And it seems the Trump campaign knows this, which is why it has been campaigning against Harris even before it was clear Biden was going to drop out.The attacks on Harris from the right have been very brazen in their misogyny and racism. For example, the New York Post published a column earlier this month saying Harris would be the country’s first “DEI president”, referring to diversity, equity and inclusion. This is a way of dismissing anybody who’s not white and not a man as not being worthy of the position they’ve earned.Trump rose to national prominence prosecuting the same kind of racist campaign against the presidency of Barack Obama.I think we can expect there to be a push for the Trump campaign not to go down that road any further. But we’ve seen in the past how Trump completely ignores that kind of conventional wisdom, and just how much that incites his base.This remains a dangerous and unpredictable era in American politics. There are no rules for what happens next.Read the original article here.-The Conversation ","summary":"President Biden steps aside, endorsing Harris as Democratic nominee, potentially uniting the party against Trump's VP pick Vance while raising concerns about a Black woman candidate's chances against Trump."},{"hash":"7330bc1dc072986eadce00ccb4154a7ae02dd73d41987665ea287f11158cb9f3","title":"a-cabinet-sans-dalits","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/07/22/a-cabinet-sans-dalits","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/thumb13-1721658959.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1721606400000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"Political parties were once a force for Dalits, but now they keep Dalits from getting ahead.

Delegates could still, technically, change their minds but nobody else received any votes in the AP survey; 54 delegates said they were undecided.The Wisconsin trip offers another opportunity for the 59-year-old former California prosecutor to reset the Democrats’ campaign and make the case that she is best positioned to beat Trump. Harris is scheduled to deliver remarks at a political event in Milwaukee at 1:05 pm.She offered a sense of how she plans to attack Trump on Monday, referring to her past of pursuing “predators” and “fraudsters” as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general.“So hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type,” she said of her rival, a convicted felon who was found liable for sexual assault in civil court. Other courts have found fraud was committed in his business, charitable foundation and private university.Wisconsin is among a trio of Rust-Belt states that include Michigan and Pennsylvania widely considered as must-wins for any candidate, and where Biden was lagging Trump.“There are independents and young people who did not like their choices, and Harris has a chance to win them,” said Paul Kendrick, executive director of the Democratic group Rust Belt Rising, which does routine polling in the battleground states where voting preferences can swing either way.FUNDRAISING WINDFALLHarris has also been raking in campaign contributions. Her campaign said Monday she had raised $81 million since Biden stepped aside on Sunday, nearly equaling the $95 million that the Biden campaign had in the bank at the end of June.Hollywood donors ended their “Dembargo” on political donations, as fundraisers and celebrities from rapper Cardi B to Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis and TV producer Shonda Rhimes endorsed Harris.Meanwhile, Trump and his allies have tried to keep Harris tethered to some of Biden's more unpopular policies, such as immigration“Kamala Harris’ dismal record is one of complete failure and utter incompetence. Her policies are Biden’s policies, and vice versa,” Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said.Whether she can turn around slumping polls in key states remains an open question.In interviews with a half-dozen leading Democrats in Wisconsin, they said Harris offers the party the opportunity to push the reset button and animate voters who were unenthused about Biden and Trump.Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said Harris, the first Black American and first South Asian American to be elected vice president, will also help bring back crucial Black voters.“Many of them didn’t come along because they were distracted by his age, distracted by his appearance,” Crowley said.Replacing Biden atop the ticket has also revved up speculation about who might join Harris as a vice presidential candidate.The short list of people being discussed included Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, US Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, according to people familiar with internal policy discussions.

Her policies are Biden’s policies, and vice versa,” Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said.Whether she can turn around slumping polls in key states remains an open question.In interviews with a half-dozen leading Democrats in Wisconsin, they said Harris offers the party the opportunity to push the reset button and animate voters who were unenthused about Biden and Trump.Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said Harris, the first Black American and first South Asian American to be elected vice president, will also help bring back crucial Black voters.“Many of them didn’t come along because they were distracted by his age, distracted by his appearance,” Crowley said.Replacing Biden atop the ticket has also revved up speculation about who might join Harris as a vice presidential candidate.The short list of people being discussed included Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, US Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, according to people familiar with internal policy discussions.

A few months into Oli’s tenure, the southern neighbour withdrew its blockade while the constitution was amended to address the concerns of the agitating communities. Though the Madhesh-based parties boycotted voting on the constitution amendment, it had partially addressed the concerns of the dissenting groups. His government also signed a historic Trade and Transit Agreement with China, ending Nepal’s sole dependence on India for third-country trade.Oli’s nationalist graph as prime minister for 10 months between October 2015 to August 2016 went up so high that his CPN-UML not only emerged the largest party from the 2017 election but was very close to the majority mark on its own. When Oli moved into Baluwatar for the second time in February 2018, he had an even stronger electoral mandate. After a merger with the CPN (Maoist Centre) two months later, the Nepal Communist Party that he jointly led with Pushpa Kamal Dahal enjoyed a near two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives. Oli’s prime ministership started with high hopes and excitement as he was leading a majority government for the first time in around two decades. As Oli was set to lead the government for a full five-year term, the hope was that decades of political instability would end, the constitution would be implemented and the federal system strengthened. The expectations, however, were short-lived. Oli started demonstrating his authoritarian streak right after taking charge as the executive head.

His government then prepared a slew of bills aiming to muzzle the media, curtail freedom of expression and shrink civic space. He had contested the elections by selling big dreams—railway connecting China, Nepal’s own ship in the high seas, and distribution of gas through pipelines, among other things. But none of these dreams even came close to fruition. Having realised he had failed to deliver as promised even two years after coming to power, he played another nationalist card—amending the constitution to show Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura in Nepal’s map—which his predecessors never dared to do.

After failing to keep the NCP united, Oli tried to dissolve the House—twice in under six months.His decision to trample on the constitution to stay in led to his humiliating exit from the government. He was ousted by the Supreme Court.

Industry insiders attribute this to the appreciation of the US dollar.The central bank said that the country earned Rs76.55 billion from tourism in the review period, surpassing the record set in 2018-19 when the country had earned Rs75.37 billion from 1.2 million foreign tourists. (At that time, the exchange rate was $1=Rs112.9.)According to a central bank report, Nepal received 1.06 million tourists in the first 11 months.“The surge in tourism income is primarily a result of the exchange rate,” said Deepak Raj Joshi, former CEO of Nepal Tourism Board. Any adjustments in the exchange rate will prompt an appreciation or depreciation of the tourist’s currency, affecting transport costs and the tourist’s decisions to visit the country. “Thus, the exchange rate impacts the number of tourist visits and tourism receipts,” said Joshi.“Besides, the growth of international chain hotels and Nepal gradually switching to a digital payment system has also contributed to the growth in tourism income.”The tourism ministry’s statistics show that the average stay of tourists in Nepal is currently 13.2 days, while they spend $41 per day.Gunakar Bhatta, spokesperson for the Nepal Rastra Bank, said the depreciated exchange rate positively relates to the tourism demand, as travel becomes less expensive when visiting a devalued country. “The currency factor, normally, forces tourists to select a destination before a trip. In this context, a country with a depreciation in domestic currency will attract international tourists,” said Bhatta. He said that while most of Nepal’s economic indicators have been underperforming, tourism has been doing exceptionally well.While Nepal’s economy is anticipated to grow by 3.87 percent in the current fiscal year, accommodation and food service, which are linked to tourism activities, are expected to see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among all 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy.“This shows how the tourism industry has been a boon for Nepal’s sluggish economic growth.”The digital payment system has also been making tourism income transparent. Paras Kunwar, chief operating officer of Fonepay, said Indian tourists have been spending Rs5 million a day since Nepal started the payment system through the quick response (QR) code on March 1.“Since the central bank has fully opened the digital retail payment gateway for Nepali operators with any other country, it will help bring more foreign currencies.”Through the budget, the government has announced that it will draw 1.6 million foreign visitors this year.According to industry insiders, the target is attainable, but there are a few challenges.From November 8, Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport will be closed for 10 hours daily, from 10 pm to 8 am, for five months until March 31, to expand the taxiways.September-November is Nepal’s peak tourist season.Besides, industry insiders say the Nepal Tourism Board has been headless for the past four months, affecting all international promotional and marketing events.A number of reports, including the latest by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said Nepal’s economic activity is expected to pick up, with growth reaching 4.9 percent in the next fiscal year 2024-25. This growth will be supported by an increase in tourist arrivals, boosting domestic demand. According to the Nepal Tourism Board, the country’s tourism promotional body, in 2023, tourist arrivals crossed the million mark for the first time in four years.Foreign arrivals had crossed the one million mark for the first time in 2018 when the country received 1.17 million foreign visitors.The number reached 1.19 million in 2019. Then, the Covid pandemic started in early 2020, bringing arrivals to a standstill. Travel restrictions and an economic slowdown triggered by lockdowns delivered a massive blow to Nepal’s burgeoning tourism industry, decimating revenues and profits after 2020.Nepal received 230,085 and 150,962 tourists in 2020 and 2021, respectively. In 2022, the number shot up to 614,869.Joshi said that by the end of 2024, Nepal may get 1.2 million tourists in the year. “A careful execution of plan and proper marketing, especially in China, could boost arrivals to 1.6 million,” said Joshi. “It will be justified to shift Kathmandu’s airport expansion from November to December, to let the peak season pass.”Dozens of luxury hotels have opened across the country so there are no problems with accommodation, he said. Nepal has been widening roads and building other infrastructure, like airports, which will help attract more tourists. However, industry insiders say the government’s neglect of air safety problems could hinder future growth, particularly in the high-end segment, where travellers consider the safety of any destination country while making travel plans.Most embassies have put Nepal’s air safety situation on their travel advisories. The European Commission imposed this list in 2013 after Nepali airlines failed to meet international safety standards. The government has wilfully ignored the call of the United Nations aviation watchdog, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, to split Nepal’s civil aviation body into two entities: service provider and regulator.

The winner this time is Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli, the unchallengeable supremo of the CPN-UML and the widely accepted chieftain of the Khas-Arya supremacists. Sher Bahadur Deuba, the chair of the Nepali Congress, figuratively carried Sharma Oli from his mansion at Balkot to the official quarters of the Prime Minister at Baluwatar. There is nothing dramatic about the political development and no surprising political shift in the power-sharing deal between the second and the largest party in Parliament under the leadership of the former. In Nepal, traditions of parliamentary procedure don’t apply, and conventions routinely fall by the wayside. The observance of ethical practices of democracy is often an exception rather than the rule.After the installation of the ethnonational chieftain as the chief executive, the jubilation in the dominant community is perhaps justified. The triumphant tone of the headline in one of the major newspapers in Nepali was unmistakable: “Ousted by mandamus, mandate reinstates”! Another editorialised it as an “opportunity for Oli” as if he hadn’t missed and misused one too many over three decades. A few other bigwigs of public life were equally celebratory, though mercifully less euphoric, about the return of Sharma Oli to the centre stage for the fourth time in less than a decade. A significant section of the dominant community is convinced that Sharma Oli is their best hope for the institutionalisation of the supremacist order that the 16-point conspiracy signed by four parties in 2015 had sought to establish for the continuation of Khas-Arya hegemony. In 2017, President Donald Trump coined a neologism with a midnight Tweet: “The state of our union was … covfefe.” The state of Nepal in the same year was so convoluted that I had to come up with an adjective to describe the prevalent supremacist atmosphere as “Oliological arguments that are neither logical nor illogical; but are doggedly obdurate, stubbornly bigoted, spiritedly jingoistic, determinedly prejudiced, indomitably chauvinistic, and unswervingly xenophobic in tone, tenor and intent.” All such propositions are beyond being true or false as they pander to the pleasurable prejudices of the existing order.Communal consensusNominally a democratic organisation espousing nationalistic socialism, the NC has always been a big tent party that offered shelter to the politicos swearing allegiance to a broad spectrum of ideologies. One could be a monarchist dyed in yellow, a pink socialist or a gilded capitalist, yet find ample space under the charismatic leadership of Bisheshwar Prasad Koirala. The definition of the “Nepali nation”, however, was common to all personal convictions of every politician.In keeping with the spirit of the anticolonial movements of the 1950s, the nationalistic aim of BP was the production of national unity with the voluntary erasure of diversities within the country. When Bedanand Jha of the Terai Congress talked about the political dimension of Pahadi domination, BP pitted Madhav Regmi against him and succeeded in mobilising the Madheshis to defeat all Madheshi contenders in the electoral fray. Benimadho Singh, a political novice, was picked to defeat the towering politician Bhadrakali Mishra. Nirgun Yadav happily vacated a constituency where Yadavs were in the majority to ensure the victory of Saroj Koirala.After the royal-military coup of 1960, the monarchists began a concerted campaign to defame the NC by questioning their nationalist credentials. The party was so much under pressure to prove its allegiance to the Pahadi identity that many of its Madheshi, Janajati and Dalit cadres began to flaunt ‘Nepali’ as their surname. When BP was the towering leader of South Asia, he could be seen in public in the white Churidar and black Sherwani ensemble. After adopting Daura-Suruwal upon becoming the Prime Minister, he was never seen in anything else, even when he was denied entry into the royal palace because the colour of his coat differed from the officially sanctioned shade for commoners.When Krishna Prasad Bhattarai went to New Delhi as the first Prime Minister of the country after the restoration of parliamentary democracy, he confronted a question about the exclusion of the Madheshis from the Nepali Army with an irrelevant retort that the Madheshis weren’t recruited as Gurkhas of foreign armies. Back home, the chutzpah of a descendant of the family priest of the Gorkhali royal family was celebrated as nationalistic. The long and short of the ideological examination is that the monarchists, the democrats, the Marxists and the Maoists subscribe to the same definition of Nepali nationality: The ethnonational supremacism of what has been constitutionally described as Khas-Arya community through the contested constitution of 2015. Due to the ethnonational solidarity around Nepalipan, perhaps a large section of the NC finds the control of Sharma Oli more comfortable than some of their own secular or somewhat less communal leaders.Alternative aspirationsThe Madheshis came to the streets in 2007 mainly because the Maoists and the mainstream parties had failed to address their aspirations of identity, representation and self-rule through the interim constitution. Divided between the territories under the control of Gorkhali expansionists and the East India Company (EIC) after the ratification of the treaty of Sugauli in 1816, the Madheshis continued to be a bewildered nation. Gorkhalis treated Madhesh as a productive territory to sustain their military. In the cost-benefit analysis of the EIC, the rate of return on the investment of holding on to the conquered territories in the flood-prone flatlands below the Churia ranges wasn’t worth the trouble. Abandoned by losers and winners alike, the Madheshis were left to their own devices for almost two centuries.Unlike the Pahadis in Madhesh, the Madheshis aren’t settlers in an alien land. The history of the Gorkhali conquest is hardly two centuries old, while the ancestors of the Maithils and the Awadhis have lived in the region for millennia. However, they hardly fall under the indigenous category in the sense of the Malaysian term bumiputera. The Tamils of Sri Lanka had to bear the burden of their association with British colonisers, but the Madheshis were at the forefront of struggles against Ranarchy and the absolutist regime of the Shahs.Despite sharing a racial lineage, the same people fought and got their separate states on the basis of religion and culture in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The Madheshis have no such collective memory of animosity with people across the international border. They are considered a permanent minority in their own land due to the hegemony of the ruling community.Apart from power-sharing, constitutional amendments to strengthen Khas-Arya supremacy appear to be the main agenda of the Sharma Oli government. Paradoxically, the Madheshis will probably be called upon to protect the constitution that they once burnt to register their protest because not doing so will create conditions for fresh confrontations and a further increase in state violence. Contemplating the fate of permanent minorities under the regime of a hegemonic majority, political theorist Mahmood Mamdani postulates, “… violence can be especially ferocious when one community comes to believe that it is the state.” Ruefully moans Cecil Day Lewis: It is the logic of our times, No subject for immortal verse – That we who lived by honest dreams Defend the bad against the worse.

In Nepal, traditions of parliamentary procedure don’t apply, and conventions routinely fall by the wayside. The observance of ethical practices of democracy is often an exception rather than the rule.After the installation of the ethnonational chieftain as the chief executive, the jubilation in the dominant community is perhaps justified. The triumphant tone of the headline in one of the major newspapers in Nepali was unmistakable: “Ousted by mandamus, mandate reinstates”! Another editorialised it as an “opportunity for Oli” as if he hadn’t missed and misused one too many over three decades. A few other bigwigs of public life were equally celebratory, though mercifully less euphoric, about the return of Sharma Oli to the centre stage for the fourth time in less than a decade. A significant section of the dominant community is convinced that Sharma Oli is their best hope for the institutionalisation of the supremacist order that the 16-point conspiracy signed by four parties in 2015 had sought to establish for the continuation of Khas-Arya hegemony. In 2017, President Donald Trump coined a neologism with a midnight Tweet: “The state of our union was … covfefe.” The state of Nepal in the same year was so convoluted that I had to come up with an adjective to describe the prevalent supremacist atmosphere as “Oliological arguments that are neither logical nor illogical; but are doggedly obdurate, stubbornly bigoted, spiritedly jingoistic, determinedly prejudiced, indomitably chauvinistic, and unswervingly xenophobic in tone, tenor and intent.” All such propositions are beyond being true or false as they pander to the pleasurable prejudices of the existing order.Communal consensusNominally a democratic organisation espousing nationalistic socialism, the NC has always been a big tent party that offered shelter to the politicos swearing allegiance to a broad spectrum of ideologies. One could be a monarchist dyed in yellow, a pink socialist or a gilded capitalist, yet find ample space under the charismatic leadership of Bisheshwar Prasad Koirala. The definition of the “Nepali nation”, however, was common to all personal convictions of every politician.In keeping with the spirit of the anticolonial movements of the 1950s, the nationalistic aim of BP was the production of national unity with the voluntary erasure of diversities within the country. When Bedanand Jha of the Terai Congress talked about the political dimension of Pahadi domination, BP pitted Madhav Regmi against him and succeeded in mobilising the Madheshis to defeat all Madheshi contenders in the electoral fray. Benimadho Singh, a political novice, was picked to defeat the towering politician Bhadrakali Mishra. Nirgun Yadav happily vacated a constituency where Yadavs were in the majority to ensure the victory of Saroj Koirala.After the royal-military coup of 1960, the monarchists began a concerted campaign to defame the NC by questioning their nationalist credentials. The party was so much under pressure to prove its allegiance to the Pahadi identity that many of its Madheshi, Janajati and Dalit cadres began to flaunt ‘Nepali’ as their surname. When BP was the towering leader of South Asia, he could be seen in public in the white Churidar and black Sherwani ensemble. After adopting Daura-Suruwal upon becoming the Prime Minister, he was never seen in anything else, even when he was denied entry into the royal palace because the colour of his coat differed from the officially sanctioned shade for commoners.When Krishna Prasad Bhattarai went to New Delhi as the first Prime Minister of the country after the restoration of parliamentary democracy, he confronted a question about the exclusion of the Madheshis from the Nepali Army with an irrelevant retort that the Madheshis weren’t recruited as Gurkhas of foreign armies. Back home, the chutzpah of a descendant of the family priest of the Gorkhali royal family was celebrated as nationalistic. The long and short of the ideological examination is that the monarchists, the democrats, the Marxists and the Maoists subscribe to the same definition of Nepali nationality: The ethnonational supremacism of what has been constitutionally described as Khas-Arya community through the contested constitution of 2015. Due to the ethnonational solidarity around Nepalipan, perhaps a large section of the NC finds the control of Sharma Oli more comfortable than some of their own secular or somewhat less communal leaders.Alternative aspirationsThe Madheshis came to the streets in 2007 mainly because the Maoists and the mainstream parties had failed to address their aspirations of identity, representation and self-rule through the interim constitution. Divided between the territories under the control of Gorkhali expansionists and the East India Company (EIC) after the ratification of the treaty of Sugauli in 1816, the Madheshis continued to be a bewildered nation. Gorkhalis treated Madhesh as a productive territory to sustain their military. In the cost-benefit analysis of the EIC, the rate of return on the investment of holding on to the conquered territories in the flood-prone flatlands below the Churia ranges wasn’t worth the trouble. Abandoned by losers and winners alike, the Madheshis were left to their own devices for almost two centuries.Unlike the Pahadis in Madhesh, the Madheshis aren’t settlers in an alien land. The history of the Gorkhali conquest is hardly two centuries old, while the ancestors of the Maithils and the Awadhis have lived in the region for millennia. However, they hardly fall under the indigenous category in the sense of the Malaysian term bumiputera. The Tamils of Sri Lanka had to bear the burden of their association with British colonisers, but the Madheshis were at the forefront of struggles against Ranarchy and the absolutist regime of the Shahs.Despite sharing a racial lineage, the same people fought and got their separate states on the basis of religion and culture in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The Madheshis have no such collective memory of animosity with people across the international border. They are considered a permanent minority in their own land due to the hegemony of the ruling community.Apart from power-sharing, constitutional amendments to strengthen Khas-Arya supremacy appear to be the main agenda of the Sharma Oli government. Paradoxically, the Madheshis will probably be called upon to protect the constitution that they once burnt to register their protest because not doing so will create conditions for fresh confrontations and a further increase in state violence. Contemplating the fate of permanent minorities under the regime of a hegemonic majority, political theorist Mahmood Mamdani postulates, “… violence can be especially ferocious when one community comes to believe that it is the state.” Ruefully moans Cecil Day Lewis: It is the logic of our times, No subject for immortal verse – That we who lived by honest dreams Defend the bad against the worse.

Article 76 (2) of the Constitution of Nepal states that the President appoints as prime minister a member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with support from two or more parties. Soon after the President’s call, UML chief Oli presented the signatures of 165 lawmakers (including 88 from the Congress and 77 from the UML) to show the House’s majority in his favour.Oli will be appointed the new prime minister by Sunday evening as no other leader from any party in Parliament can produce a majority.And with that, the Congress and the UML have now entered a new phase of collaboration. As per the deal, the two parties will head the government on a rotational basis for the remaining term of Parliament.Leaders from both parties say that they decided to join hands with specific goals, mainly of ensuring political stability, reviewing and amending the constitution, and giving an impetus to the country’s sluggish economy.The two major political rivals have jointly run the country on some occasions in the past, for at least half a dozen times. The latest instance was in the Sushil Koirala government in February 2014 formed after the second Constituent Assembly election. The Congress-UML administration was formed with the key mandate of promulgating the constitution, which they successfully did in September 2015.The two parties first collaborated to run a government in the Krishna Prasad Bhattarai-led government in 1990. The key mandate of that government was to promulgate the constitution and hold first the parliamentary elections after the reinstatement of multiparty democracy that year.After that, they ran a coalition government in 1996, led by Girija Prasad Koirala. That government was formed to hold general elections amid a challenging time as the erstwhile CPN (Maoist) had just launched an insurgency. The two parties also collaborated in the Koirala government formed after the Second People’s Movement in 2006 that produced the Interim Constitution in 2007. In the first Constituent Assembly, too, the Congress and the UML shared power. This was the first time the Congress was in a government led by a UML leader. In 2009, the then second-largest party Congress had supported UML leader Madhav Kumar Nepal, who now chairs the CPN (Unified Socialist), as prime minister after the fall of the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government. The UML was the third-largest party at the time.There were collaborations between the Congress and the UML on other occasions as well but that was with splinter factions such as the Nepali Congress (Democratic) led by Sher Bahadur Deuba.Despite their long experience of working together, the two parties’ collaboration may not be a smooth sailing this time around, political observers say.They argue that UML leaders and party committees may follow the decisions made by Oli as other leaders are less likely to challenge his decisions. But in the Congress, there are a number of factions, due to which the cooperation of the Congress-UML coalition may face challenges. “The UML is a party which works in a centralised system in which no one challenges the final say of their chief Oli, whereas in the Congress, though Deuba prevails most of the time, he is often challenged by other leaders,” Chandra Dev Bhatta, a political analyst told the Post. “When two parties have different orientations and working styles, they are bound to have challenges in running the government.”Pradip Paudel, a Congress leader, said if the party president comes up with a valid agenda that benefits the general public and the country, all Congress leaders cooperate with him. “It's true that we oppose the decisions that are not in favour of the country and its public,” Paudel told the Post. But it's not true that two big parties cannot cooperate with each other, Paudel argued. “Despite the differences in schooling and working styles, we have instances of the two parties delivering when they had a specific mandate,” he said.In 1990 and 2014, the two parties forged coalitions to promulgate the constitution, which they did. “The number of spoilers in those days was fewer than what it is today,” Bhatta added. “The collaboration may go smoothly for a few months after government formation, but they will have issues later given that these two parties are competitors in national politics.” But another political analyst CK Lal has a different opinion. Lal said that the Congress opted to cooperate with UML due to its diminishing confidence. Until the Congress regains its lost confidence, this coalition government won’t face a major problem, Lal added.In the 2022 elections, despite the Congress securing the highest number of seats in the federal parliament, the UML received the highest number of votes in the proportional representation category.“Being the largest party in the lower house of Parliament, the Congress seems to have acknowledged that the UML is the largest political force in the country, and that is the reason the Congress became ready to accept the UML’s leadership,” Lal told the Post. “Besides, the Congress possibly accepted the UML’s leadership to ensure they don’t tie up with the Maoist Centre next election.”Many leaders from the two parties argue that strengthening democracy can be a common reason for the two parties banding together. The two parties may be competitors but they fought together at least twice against the monarchy to restore democracy. But analysts say these two parties, which are eyeing better performance in the next general election, might not pursue a long-term cooperation.Congress leader Paudel said that the future of their alliance with the UML might be in question only if Oli tries to run the government unilaterally. “Until the party leading the government respects the senior coalition partner, I don’t think there will be any problem in the government’s continuation,” Paudel added.Until July 1, leaders of these two arch-rival forces were engaged in accusing each other of involvement in huge corruption scams. Congress leaders accused UML leaders’ hand in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land swap scam while the UML pointed to Congress leaders’ role in the Bhutanese refugees scam.Prithvi Subba Gurung, a UML deputy general secretary, said that partnership in the government “does not necessarily mean we cannot question the other for the mistakes we believe the other party has committed.”“This coalition is for political stability in the country,” Gurung told the Post. “But it does not mean that leaders from both parties should be barred from pointing out each other’s mistakes.” ","summary":"The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the country’s two largest political parties, have come together to form the government for the first time in almost a decade.Backed by the Congress, UML chair KP Sharma Oli staked his claim to the prime minister’s post within hours after President Ramchandra Paudel invited a member of the House of Representatives to show a majority in the lower house with the support of two or more parties by Sunday evening.Following the failure of Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the outgoing prime minister, to secure a majority in Friday’s floor test, President Paudel on Friday evening invited political parties to form a new government under Article 76 (2) of the constitution.

The family is currently living at a temporary shelter in Nalgad Municipality-4 of Jajarkot district. What was already an arduous stay got worse after the start of the monsoon—the temporary hut struggles to keep out even normal rain if it continues for some hours, Mahar says. And when it rains, the food grains and clothes get wet.Mahar’s family relocated to the hut after the November 3 earthquake damaged their home. So moving back to the home is not an option, Mahar says. “The earthquake has weakened the land around the village, so the fear of landslides keeps us awake at night,” he says. “Now that it has started raining heavily, we have no option but to stay awake all night.”Mahar’s is not the only family that has had to battle monsoon with very few resources. The government has identified a total of 48,517 families in need of rehabilitation in the 6.4 magnitude earthquake. As many as 34,954 temporary shelters have been constructed so far. The rest of the families are forced to stay either in the flimsy tarpaulin tents or staying in the old house damaged by the quake.Chief District Officer of Jajarkot Umakant Adhikari said that since June, the details of 24,557 families have been included in the disaster management protocol. According to him, after releasing the second tranche of the housing reconstruction aid to build temporary huts, the amount is being distributed through the respective ward offices.Similarly, the second tranche has been released to 16,000 earthquake displaced families in Rukum West. Chief District Officer of Rukum West Hari Prasad Pant said that Rs400 million was sent to the local level account as second instalment for the construction of temporary housing. According to him, 32,006 beneficiaries have been recorded throughout the district. He informed that an additional budget has been requested from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority to provide funds to the rest.The earthquake victims complain that they are hugely affected by the monsoon rains. Lal Bahadur Mahar of Bheri Municipality-1 said that the clothes and food that gets wet when it rains have to be brought outside and dried when the sun shines. According to him, some families of the village risked their lives as they returned to the cracked houses. “The roof is constantly leaking,” he said. “It is very difficult to live here.”Many earthquake victims are taken ill in several settlements of earthquake affected districts of Jajarkot, Rukum West and Salyan. Children, senior citizens and patients of chronic diseases are the hardest hit. “Due to the intense heat and rain, the victims of the earthquake began to fall ill rapidly,” said Dr Priya Shahi of Basic Hospital in Chhedagadh. According to him, 50 to 100 patients come to the hospital daily for treatment of diarrhoea, fever, typhoid and pneumonia. He informed that almost 60 percent of those who come to the hospital are children.As per the record available at the district hospital in Jajarkot, around 150 people visit the health facility on a daily basis.The earthquake displaced people are exposed to monsoon-induced disasters. At present, most of the earthquake victims have built temporary housing near forests, riverbanks, edges of their farmland and on steep land. “Many of the quake-displaced families are at high risk of floods and landslides,” said Nar Bahadur Nepali, general secretary of Nepal Red Cross Society in Karnali Province. “The quake victims faced health problems during the cold winter and hot summer days. Now they are left at the risk of floods and landslides.”According to geologist Chandan Giri, there is a high risk of landslides in the areas affected by the earthquake. He said the risk of landslides is almost 80 percent higher after an earthquake than in other normal situations. After the earthquake, a team of five technicians led by him studied some villages in Nalgad, Bheri municipalities and Barekot Rural Municipality of Jajarkot and found that the land around various settlements was torn. “There is a risk of erosion and large landslides in those cracked areas,” he said, warning about the huge loss of lives and properties.The local people complained that the authorities concerned are indifferent about their hardships. However, Rabilal Sharma, secretary of Internal Affairs and Ministry of Law of Karnali Province, said that they have started preparation after studying the risk of landslides in the earthquake-affected settlements. According to him, all security mechanisms have been readied to minimise possible risks.16 families displaced due to the risk of landslidesAs the risk of landslides is looming large, 16 families of Chaupani in Bheri Municipality-1 have been displaced. The ward office has transferred 11 families to a nearby school, four families have moved to India while one family is taking shelter in a relative’s house, according to Deepak Rana, ward chair of Bheri Municipality-1.The district administration claims that it has carried out necessary initiatives to protect the quake-displaced people from the water-induced disasters. Adhikari, the Jajarkot CDO, said that a police team under the command of Assistant Sub-Inspector of Nepal Police has been mobilised to identify the families who are at high risk. “The families at risk are being searched and shifted to safer locations timely,” he added.

He is scheduled to seek a vote of confidence in the House on Sunday.Thapa said that they have “doubts” and “suspicions” over whether Oli will hand over the premiership to his party as per the agreement reached between the prime minister and the Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba. Ahead of government formation, Oli and Deuba signed a seven-point deal on July 1 outlining the power-sharing agreement between the two largest parties. Under this, Oli will lead the government for the first two years and Deuba will become the prime minister for the remaining time—until the holding of the general elections in 2027.Sharma said that the Congress should not remain silent on the issues and controversies surrounding Oli. The UML chairman was dragged into the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu land scam in particular, an issue the Congress strongly raised in Parliament while the UML was in the government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Now in the Oli government, many have voiced concerns whether the largest party will continue to raise the issue of Giri Bandhu land scam.Both general secretaries were not involved in the negotiations when Oli and Deuba assigned their close aides to work out their partnership in government. “So they are venting their ire and frustration,” a leader close to Deuba said. “Both Deuba and Oli are determined and committed to implementing the agreement they signed.”Thapa said the Congress rank and file harbours suspicions whether Oli will hand over the power to Deuba. Addressing a function in Kathmandu on Saturday, Thapa, who took the news of the Congress and the UML agreeing to form a coalition as a surprise, said what the general people will get from the government of the two largest parties is more important than the political stability they have promised.Political stability should deliver gains in the economy and good governance, he argued. Tired of frequent changes in government, the two parties had agreed not to change the government until 2027. In the first phase, Oli is agreed to be the prime minister for two years. Deuba will then govern for the remaining time of the House. “But we doubt whether this agreement will be respected,” said Thapa.Oli’s past, his nature and attitude give room for this kind of suspicion but the prime minister knows very well that this is the last time for the Congress and the UML to correct the political course, Thapa argued. “Oli has appointed good experts as advisers so we are confident he is serious this time about delivery.”Pointing to Dahal, the CPN (Maoist Centre) leader with 32 seats in the House, who ran the government for one and a half years riding the backs of the UML and the Congress alternatively, Thapa said the current political situation had resulted from the betrayal by the senior party leaders against each other. “They deceived and lied to each other 15 to 16 times in the past.”The level of mistrust and perceived deceit was so high that the two parties came together to oust Dahal, Thapa said. “The prime minister should make the seven-point deal public. The government should dispel suspicions and both parties should be committed to the agreement,” he added.The parliamentary parties of the Congress and the UML have already endorsed the seven-point deal and vowed to implement it though the content of the agreement has not been made public.General Secretary Sharma said the two-party deal should shield no leader from corruption and irregularities.The Congress will not remain silent on the issues it raised against Oli in the past, Sharma said at a function in Kathmandu on Saturday. “We will work to make the Oli government successful but we will not remain quiet in his weakness.”Both Oli and Sharma are elected representatives from Jhapa district, where the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate is located.“We will extend all possible support to the Oli government to make it successful. We will give the vote of trust too but that does not mean we will close our eyes when a controversy related to Oli surfaces,” said Sharma. ","summary":"Barely a week after the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML came together to form a new government, two general secretaries of the Congress—Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma—made chilling remarks on Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, the UML leader, on Saturday.With the backing of Congress, the single largest party in the House of Representatives, Oli was sworn in for his third prime ministerial stint on Monday. He is scheduled to seek a vote of confidence in the House on Sunday.Thapa said that they have “doubts” and “suspicions” over whether Oli will hand over the premiership to his party as per the agreement reached between the prime minister and the Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba. Ahead of government formation, Oli and Deuba signed a seven-point deal on July 1 outlining the power-sharing agreement between the two largest parties. Under this, Oli will lead the government for the first two years and Deuba will become the prime minister for the remaining time—until the holding of the general elections in 2027.Sharma said that the Congress should not remain silent on the issues and controversies surrounding Oli. The UML chairman was dragged into the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu land scam in particular, an issue the Congress strongly raised in Parliament while the UML was in the government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Now in the Oli government, many have voiced concerns whether the largest party will continue to raise the issue of Giri Bandhu land scam.Both general secretaries were not involved in the negotiations when Oli and Deuba assigned their close aides to work out their partnership in government. “So they are venting their ire and frustration,” a leader close to Deuba said. “Both Deuba and Oli are determined and committed to implementing the agreement they signed.”Thapa said the Congress rank and file harbours suspicions whether Oli will hand over the power to Deuba. Addressing a function in Kathmandu on Saturday, Thapa, who took the news of the Congress and the UML agreeing to form a coalition as a surprise, said what the general people will get from the government of the two largest parties is more important than the political stability they have promised.Political stability should deliver gains in the economy and good governance, he argued. Tired of frequent changes in government, the two parties had agreed not to change the government until 2027. In the first phase, Oli is agreed to be the prime minister for two years. Deuba will then govern for the remaining time of the House. “But we doubt whether this agreement will be respected,” said Thapa.Oli’s past, his nature and attitude give room for this kind of suspicion but the prime minister knows very well that this is the last time for the Congress and the UML to correct the political course, Thapa argued. “Oli has appointed good experts as advisers so we are confident he is serious this time about delivery.”Pointing to Dahal, the CPN (Maoist Centre) leader with 32 seats in the House, who ran the government for one and a half years riding the backs of the UML and the Congress alternatively, Thapa said the current political situation had resulted from the betrayal by the senior party leaders against each other. “They deceived and lied to each other 15 to 16 times in the past.”The level of mistrust and perceived deceit was so high that the two parties came together to oust Dahal, Thapa said. “The prime minister should make the seven-point deal public. The government should dispel suspicions and both parties should be committed to the agreement,” he added.The parliamentary parties of the Congress and the UML have already endorsed the seven-point deal and vowed to implement it though the content of the agreement has not been made public.General Secretary Sharma said the two-party deal should shield no leader from corruption and irregularities.The Congress will not remain silent on the issues it raised against Oli in the past, Sharma said at a function in Kathmandu on Saturday. “We will work to make the Oli government successful but we will not remain quiet in his weakness.”Both Oli and Sharma are elected representatives from Jhapa district, where the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate is located.“We will extend all possible support to the Oli government to make it successful. We will give the vote of trust too but that does not mean we will close our eyes when a controversy related to Oli surfaces,” said Sharma.

Officials at the Public Construction Department under the metropolis said that the contractor resumed the work after the High Court, Patan issued an interim order paving the way for following an interim order from the High Court, Patan allowing the work to proceed. “Now there is no obstruction from locals nor from federal government agencies,” said Baburam Bhattarai, a member of the City Planning Commission under the KMC. “We hope that the project will be completed at the earliest.”The metropolis had awarded a contract to widen the sidewalks by 1.5 metres along both sides of the road section between the New Road gate and the Juddha Statue roundabout in the last fiscal year. The work started in the New Road area in May, but a jurisdictional dispute between the city office and the Road Division, Kathmandu, caused the project to come to a halt. The division confiscated contractors’ equipment, and the federal government deployed police in to prevent the city office from working. Some local residents, too, had demonstrated against the pavement widening plan. The division had even repaired the parts of roads cut for pavement expansion.And on June 9, the metropolis moved the High Court challenging the breach of jurisdiction by the road division, which is a federal agency, and its intervention in the city’s work.City officials were already frustrated by the years-long delay by federal agencies in completing another project, the widening of Kathmandu’s Ring Road in the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section, which has caused huge inconvenience to the public due to dust and mud.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed city officials to dump truckloads of dirt from the Ring Road section in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office at Minbhawan, accusing federal agencies of delaying the work.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years due to Covid and delays in clearing the power poles and in some cases structures along the right of way.Regarding the jurisdiction dispute over the sidewalk widening work in the city, a division bench of judges Dhurba Raj Nand and Prakash Kharel at the High Court Patan issued an interim order in favour of the metropolis on Sunday.The City office has already widening pavements by 1 metre on both sides in the Bhrikutimandap area. “Neither did the federal government agency intervene, nor did locals object while expanding pavement in the Bhrikutimandap area by narrowing the road,” said Bhattarai. “Further decisions on pavement widening in other areas like Thamel, Handigaun and others will be taken after collecting public feedback.”Officials said that the long-term plan is to restrict motor vehicles altogether in the New Road area due to heavy pedestrian traffic. “We have also been working to find a solution to the parking problem and weighing various options including setting up multi-storey parking facilities,” said Bhattarai, who is also an urban planner.Officials said that pavements in the New Road area, which always remain crowded, should be widened to ensure free pedestrian movement. Officials claimed that New Road residents have also requested the city office to expand the pavement.According to city officials, local residents have, from time to time, complained about feeling unsafe and experiencing sexual harassment on the narrow and crowded sidewalks.

Officials said the move aims to ensure smooth transfer of waste as roads to the landfill often become impassable during the monsoon, preventing the passage of garbage trucks.“We have deployed three excavators, two bulldozers and two loaders to clear landslide debris along the road to the Bancharedanda landfill,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. “Also, we have kept five more vehicles on standby for immediate deployment if needed.”Every year, during monsoon season, the road to landfill sites gets obstructed in multiple places, obstructing the transfer of house waste collected in the three districts of the capital city—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Apart from these, some local levels of Kavrepalanchok also discard garbage at the landfill site at Bancharedanda.The metropolis officials said that they had purchased 10 high-pressure pumps to drain floodwaters from inundated settlements.“Five pumps have already been sent to the high-risk areas along riversides,” said Shrestha. “These can quickly pump away floodwaters.”The city office started repairing the Sisdole road leading to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district just a few weeks before the start of the monsoon. Officials said Rs30 million had been allocated for repairs, which included fixing potholes, concreting roads, and other works.Around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised, according to officials.Besides monsoon-induced road obstructions, garbage disposal is sometimes disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions cause weeks-long halt to door-to-door garbage collection, leading people in the Valley to discard their trash on streets.Officials said that a high-pressure pump is being used to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground.Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The City office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.The city office recently sold non-degradable waste worth Rs700,000.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled.

Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.“Every Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,” said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. “Decisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks.

Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results.

This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide.

Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide.

Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu.

However, the proportion of tourists visiting the country’s first national park has changed, with nearly 58 percent of visitors to the park being domestic tourists.The increased numbers have cheered tourism entrepreneurs, but conservationists say that rising footfalls may pose bigger threats to wildlife. They have stressed the need for effective conservation action now more than ever.The national park is home to tigers, one-horned rhinos, elephants, gharials, birds, and more, but the biggest draw is the famed Royal Bengal tiger.Ganesh Prasad Tiwari, conservation officer, said 306,837 people visited the park in the last fiscal year, contributing Rs367.29 in revenue. The number of tourists in the previous fiscal year was 299,412, and the revenue was Rs298.96 million. “Both the tourist numbers and the revenue are the highest.”Chitwan National Park, established in 1973, is Nepal’s first national park. Located in the southern central Tarai, the property covers an area of 93,200 hectares and extends over four districts: Chitwan, Nawalparasi, Parsa, and Makwanpur.It is a habitat of endangered animals such as one-horned rhinos, tigers, gharials, and crocodiles.Wild elephants, many birds, aquatic animals, and plants are also found here. The tribal Tharu, Bote, Kumal, and Darai live in the park surroundings, and tourists also prefer to observe their culture and lifestyle.With its rich biodiversity, the park has received several international recognitions for conservation and has, over the years, also gained popularity as a wildlife safari destination.The park, which relies heavily on tourism revenue, and the hundreds of people who depend on tourism for survival, faced an unprecedented drought in tourism when the Covid pandemic hit Nepal two years ago.Foreign tourists stopped coming to Chitwan after the Covid-19 pandemic, which inadvertently threatened humans' and animals' livelihoods and survival. However, officials said that tourism recovered in Chitwan at a fast pace.The increased footfall brings money but also many challenges, conservationists say.If the numbers keep rising, there is an emerging risk of habitat degradation, biodiversity loss, increased human-wildlife interaction, and disease transmission, said Tika Giri, a senior conservationist who was a nature guide in 1980. “These need effective conservation action now more than ever before.”He said there is unhealthy competition in the resorts. “Undercutting tariff rates in resorts to attract tourists should be stopped. It’s not a healthy way to promote wildlife tourism. Competition should be in providing service, not slashing the rates.”Giri said that conservation seems to have been neglected after the earthquake, blockade, and the coronavirus lockdown.Currently, the Jeep Safari, one of the popular activities, is closed due to the monsoon. However, other activities occur in the park's buffer zone, particularly in the community forest areas.During the tourist season, elephant safaris in the Baghmara Community Forest of Sauraha and jeep and boat safaris on the Rapti river are very popular.During the tourist season (March-May and September-November), more than 500 people go boating in Narayani and Rapti daily. Similarly, 70 elephants are used for safaris daily. Although June to August is the slack season due to the monsoon, it has not prevented tourists from visiting the park.Babita Chaudhary, another hotelier, said that the effect of increased numbers of wildlife goers needs to be seen in business. “The business has grown slightly compared to the Covid period, but there’s not much to cheer about.”In the last fiscal year, more than half of the park visitors were Nepalis. Of the total tourists, 176,316 were domestic.The park maintains details of Nepalis, and visitors from the SAARC region and the outer world. The number of tourists from the third country amounted to 94,050, while there were 36,471 visitors from the SAARC countries. At one time, more than 60 percent of the tourists visiting the park were foreigners. Chaudhary said that the number of foreign tourists in Chitwan has dropped sharply and requested the government to implement effective marketing and promotional activities in the key source markets.“The world, including Nepal, is facing an economic slowdown. The roads are in a poor state. In such a situation, there are many challenges.”The highest number of foreign tourists Chitwan received was in 2014-15. Excluding visitors from SAARC, there were 127,000 foreigners, the highest number recorded so far. Giri said that wildlife is Chitwan’s tourism attraction. “We need to save our identity. The park and its surrounding forests and environment should be protected. Picnics and dances, which cause disturbances to wildlife, should not be promoted.” Jagnarayan Bote, the leader of the Bote community who runs a homestay in Chitwan Madi Pandav Nagar, said that expanding tourism in all areas would benefit the locals.Tourists who visit Chitwan Park enjoy activities such as jeep safari, elephant safari, boat safari, and walking through the forest with an experienced nature guide. Ganga Giri, president of the Chitwan Sauraha Regional Hotel Association, said that due to the one-way jeep safari route from Sauraha to the park’s west, the crowding has increased, and tourism and wildlife have also been affected. Tiwari, the park's conservation officer, said they are making arrangements for a new jeep safari route.

Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. Changes in rainfall pattern, extreme weather incidents, and the proliferation of pests have been directly hitting crop production and threatening food security.The course she is pursuing offers little knowledge about climate change, but a two-day training she attended recently was of some help.“While studying the 10-month course, I learned new things, and practical know-how on crop plantation and harvest,” Bohora said. “The training I received on climate change was more useful.” It taught them how to adapt farming techniques to the changing climate.According to a new survey report, climate change has profound impacts on Nepal’s economy, particularly agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity.The findings of the National Climate Change Survey 2022, the second of its kind, were recently released by the National Statistics Office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics. The report paints a bleak picture of Nepal's climate situation and urges necessary intervention for the resource-crunch Himalayan nation.According to the survey, economic losses on and off-farm in the past five years, as reported by households, amounted to Rs415.44 billion. This does not include significant infrastructural damages.In Nepal, the number of households unaware of the consequences of climate change is significantly high.The survey shows that many households reported adverse weather changes. They noted that their water resources dried up, new diseases infected crops, productivity losses rose, and flowering and fruiting behaviours changed over the last two and a half decades.According to the survey, over the past 25 years, approximately 50 percent of households reported the emergence of new diseases in their crops, 53.9 percent observed the presence of new insects or pests affecting their crops, and 29.8 percent of households noted the appearance of new diseases in their livestock.Rural areas experienced more new diseases affecting crops (55.9 percent) than urban areas (45.6 percent). The mountain (68.7 percent), hill (50.3 percent), and Tarai (46.3 percent) regions also experienced an impact on crops due to new diseases.Agriculture is the mainstay of Nepal’s economy. It contributes 24.60 percent to the country's GDP and employs over half the population. The sector is heavily dependent on rainfall.For Susmita Thapa, a grade 12 student at Satyabadi Secondary School, receiving training on climate change has been an eye opener.“We learned the inter-relation between agriculture and climate change,” said Thapa. “Our formal classes do not teach about climate change, its impact, and the ways to tackle it.” Training participants said they have learned how to tackle climate change's impact on crops. Thapa also was informed on various climate adaptation measures. “The learning will be beneficial.”Amid the growing impact of climate change on agriculture in recent years, farmers in Bajhang have been informed on the challenges and ways to tackle the emerging problem.They have been acquainted with sustainable farming systems to boost output.The training was supported by the Biodiversity (Jal-jangal) program of the USAID, Social Development Center, a local organisation.“We stopped sowing local seeds after their yield declined. Now I know why this was happening,” said Birkha Mijar, a farmer in Thalara rural municipality Ward 9. “We knew what local seeds meant for sustainable farming. We also know the way to sow them. I will apply what I learned in the field.”Kubendra Rokaya, an instructor, said he has trained 600 students and farmers in the district on mitigating the impacts of climate change on agriculture.“Farmers in the far-western Nepal are unhappy as commercial farming is not very profitable. On top of that, climate distress has been a headache for farmers,” Rokaya said. “We can tackle the impacts of climate change by using local resources and technology. But many farmers are unaware of this.” The training has taught them new practices.“We have informed them on the impact of climate change at the local level, use of weather information, pest management, seed selection and early warning system,” Rokaya said.Amit Banmala, coordinator of the Social Development Center Project, said students pursuing agriculture science and agriculture JTAs are Nepal's future guides to farming. Many of them are engaged in agriculture.The agriculture sector in Bajhang faces drought in the winter and excessive rainfall in the rainy season.According to the Agriculture Knowledge Centre, droughts last year reduced winter produce by 20 percent. “Landslides and floods compound the problem in the agriculture sector every year,” said Tek Bahadur Bista, the centre’s chief.“Farmers are facing additional trouble. It’s important for them to learn about mitigation measures.” ","summary":"Lalita Bohora of Dhalaun in Saipal rural municipality has been doing a junior technical assistant course in agriculture for a year and a half at Jalpa Secondary School.Bohora is learning how to plant crops, control pests, and other modern farming practices.The field also demands she learn about climate change, an emerging issue threatening global agricultural production. Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. Changes in rainfall pattern, extreme weather incidents, and the proliferation of pests have been directly hitting crop production and threatening food security.The course she is pursuing offers little knowledge about climate change, but a two-day training she attended recently was of some help.“While studying the 10-month course, I learned new things, and practical know-how on crop plantation and harvest,” Bohora said. “The training I received on climate change was more useful.” It taught them how to adapt farming techniques to the changing climate.According to a new survey report, climate change has profound impacts on Nepal’s economy, particularly agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity.The findings of the National Climate Change Survey 2022, the second of its kind, were recently released by the National Statistics Office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics. The report paints a bleak picture of Nepal's climate situation and urges necessary intervention for the resource-crunch Himalayan nation.According to the survey, economic losses on and off-farm in the past five years, as reported by households, amounted to Rs415.44 billion. This does not include significant infrastructural damages.In Nepal, the number of households unaware of the consequences of climate change is significantly high.The survey shows that many households reported adverse weather changes. They noted that their water resources dried up, new diseases infected crops, productivity losses rose, and flowering and fruiting behaviours changed over the last two and a half decades.According to the survey, over the past 25 years, approximately 50 percent of households reported the emergence of new diseases in their crops, 53.9 percent observed the presence of new insects or pests affecting their crops, and 29.8 percent of households noted the appearance of new diseases in their livestock.Rural areas experienced more new diseases affecting crops (55.9 percent) than urban areas (45.6 percent). The mountain (68.7 percent), hill (50.3 percent), and Tarai (46.3 percent) regions also experienced an impact on crops due to new diseases.Agriculture is the mainstay of Nepal’s economy. It contributes 24.60 percent to the country's GDP and employs over half the population. The sector is heavily dependent on rainfall.For Susmita Thapa, a grade 12 student at Satyabadi Secondary School, receiving training on climate change has been an eye opener.“We learned the inter-relation between agriculture and climate change,” said Thapa. “Our formal classes do not teach about climate change, its impact, and the ways to tackle it.” Training participants said they have learned how to tackle climate change's impact on crops. Thapa also was informed on various climate adaptation measures. “The learning will be beneficial.”Amid the growing impact of climate change on agriculture in recent years, farmers in Bajhang have been informed on the challenges and ways to tackle the emerging problem.They have been acquainted with sustainable farming systems to boost output.The training was supported by the Biodiversity (Jal-jangal) program of the USAID, Social Development Center, a local organisation.“We stopped sowing local seeds after their yield declined. Now I know why this was happening,” said Birkha Mijar, a farmer in Thalara rural municipality Ward 9. “We knew what local seeds meant for sustainable farming. We also know the way to sow them. I will apply what I learned in the field.”Kubendra Rokaya, an instructor, said he has trained 600 students and farmers in the district on mitigating the impacts of climate change on agriculture.“Farmers in the far-western Nepal are unhappy as commercial farming is not very profitable. On top of that, climate distress has been a headache for farmers,” Rokaya said. “We can tackle the impacts of climate change by using local resources and technology. But many farmers are unaware of this.” The training has taught them new practices.“We have informed them on the impact of climate change at the local level, use of weather information, pest management, seed selection and early warning system,” Rokaya said.Amit Banmala, coordinator of the Social Development Center Project, said students pursuing agriculture science and agriculture JTAs are Nepal's future guides to farming.

The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the division, at least 1,657 people from 73 districts have been infected with the virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases with 196, followed by Jhapa with 128, Chitwan with 92, Makawanpur with 73, Okhaldhunga with 57, Tanahun with 56, Bhojpur with 52, and Doti 50 cases.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. There are five serotypes of dengue, numbered 1 through 5.Nepal has reported four serotypes of dengue virus—DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4. Last year, virus serotypes DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 were found responsible for the dengue epidemic in the country. At least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts in 2023.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Entomologists say that regular serotyping of the dengue virus is important. Pathological investigation of the deadly virus helps differentiate the serotypes of past and current infections, which will ultimately help make people aware of the risks.“People who were infected with one serotype of the dengue virus will not get infected from the same serotype immediately,” said Sishir Panta, an entomologist. “But the risk of severity will be high if he/she is infected with different serotypes. Concerned authorities can tell the people about the serotypes spreading in their communities.”Experts say the disease will not stop spreading unless the lessons and experiences gained in previous outbreaks are implemented. They say the real number of infections could be several times higher, as the government’s case reporting system is not very effective, and more than 80 percent of the cases are asymptomatic.Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms, which do not need any treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home. Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months.

Type-3 polio virus, which is vaccine-derived, has been detected in sewage samples collected from the confluence of the Tukucha and Bagmati Rivers [in Kathmandu] on May 26.”Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but was officially declared polio-free by the World Health Organisation only on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After having zero human cases of polio for about 14 years, the infectious disease has surfaced in the capital city’s sewage, which is a serious problem, according to public health officials.They said that the presence of poliovirus in sewage samples indicates the looming risk of an outbreak.Officials at the WHO, however, said there is no need to worry as no one has been found infected with the virus in the country since 2010.“There is no need to panic, as the virus has been detected only in sewage samples,” said Dr Balbindra Singh, the WHO representative. “Health agencies are taking every precaution to prevent the disease outbreak.”Officials at the National Public Health Laboratory, the agency that carries out environmental surveillance of poliovirus, said that it took two weeks to process sewage samples. The samples were then sent to the UN agency’s reference laboratory in Thailand for cell culture, as the service is available only in a few laboratories across the world.The national laboratory collects samples from five tributaries in the Kathmandu Valley and from Koshi, Madhesh, and Gandaki provinces to check for the presence of the polio virus. Following the confirmation of the virus in the sewage, health authorities scrambled to arrange a budget to launch a special vaccination drive in three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Officials informed that the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the WHO agreed to provide vaccines and other costs of the campaign, respectively.“We are launching a four-day polio vaccination campaign in all three districts of Valley from July 24 to 27,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division. “All children under five years of age will be inoculated with an additional dose of oral polio vaccine in the drive.”An estimated 300,000 children live in three districts of the Valley. Oral polio vaccine, which consists of Type-1 and Type-3 polio virus, will be administered during the campaign, following the detection of Type-3 virus in sewage samples. Officials said health workers and female community health volunteers will be mobilised in houses, schools, bus parks, and entry points to ensure that no eligible children miss the vaccine. “We have also stepped up surveillance measures that include collecting sewage samples every week, which we used to collect every fortnight, and taking stool samples of the children having paralysis for testing,” said Gautam. “We have sent some samples to Thailand for testing, and the result is pending.”Doctors say the polio virus mainly affects children and is usually transmitted through droplets or aerosols from the throat and by faecal contamination of hands, utensils, food and water. Those who do not wash their hands properly, and those who consume contaminated food and water or reside in an area where water and sanitation conditions are poor are at high risk of getting infected with the virus.The Health Ministry said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country.Childhood immunisation is the government’s number one priority, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate.

Most patients of cervical cancer in Nepal—80.9 percent—are diagnosed at a late stage, contributing to the higher mortality rate.Health officials agreed that it would be best to prevent cancer from occurring, which can only be done with the help of free screening, awareness drives and administration of the vaccine against human papillomavirus.“Symptoms of cervical cancer can be detected 10 to 12 years before, through screening,” said Dahal. \"But most patients seek treatment in the third or fourth stages of cancer, when their condition already gets complicated.”According to Dahal, free screening will be carried out in the local units of Sarlahi, Mahottari, Rautahat, Palpa, Dolakha, Kaski, Surkhet, Kailali, Sindhupalchok, Kavrepalanchok and Lalitpur districts in the current fiscal year that started this week. The budget for free screening can purchase around 130,000 test kits, which means only that number of women can be screened, said Dahal.Oncologists say early treatment can prevent up to 80 percent of cervical cancer cases.“Survival rate of cervical cancer is up to 95 percent if the treatment is started in stage 1 and up to 75 percent in stage 2,” said Dr Shivaji Poudel, executive director at the Chitwan-based BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital. “The important thing is that problems must be diagnosed at an early stage and treatment started.”Experts say awareness and free screening, along with the administration of vaccines against human papillomavirus, could help lessen the burden of cervical cancer in Nepal. If the problem is diagnosed early, the ailment can be cured at a small cost, they add.Health officials complained that the budget was not sufficient to carry out nationwide vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV), which they planned to start in the first quarter of 2025. They say that the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI) has agreed to provide vaccine doses enough for 1.7 million girls between 10 and 14.Human papillomavirus is a viral infection that spreads through skin contact. The virus causes cervical cancer, which is the second-most common cancer in the developing world. Hundreds of women get diagnosed with cervical cancer every year in Nepal.Doctors say most cervical cancers are associated with the HPV, a sexually transmitted infection. Widespread immunisation could reduce the impact of cervical cancer and other cancers caused by the HPV worldwide.Countries like Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives have introduced HPV vaccines nationally while India and Indonesia have introduced them in some districts.Last year, Nepal purchased 20,000 doses of the HPV vaccine, which were administered to around 9,000 girls aged between 14 and 15 years from all seven provinces. Health authorities administered the vaccines at schools after other measures failed to increase the vaccine’s uptake.The World Health Organisation says HPV vaccination is recommended as part of a coordinated strategy to prevent cervical cancer and other diseases caused by the virus.Nepal is also among the countries that have committed to eliminating cervical cancer by 2030. For that, the country has to meet 90-70-90 targets, which means vaccinating 90 percent of the girls with the HPV vaccine by the age 15, performing screening on 70 percent of women using a high-performance test by the age 35 and again by 45 years and provide treatment to 90 percent of women who are pre-cancer tested and manage 90 percent of the women with invasive cancer.

Provincial and local government agencies have been requested to coordinate with private schools and other stakeholders to implement the programme.”Anaemia is a condition in which blood produces low levels of haemoglobin or healthy red blood cells. Iron and other nutritional deficiencies, malaria, hookworm infection, chronic infections, and genetic conditions, including sickle cell diseases, are among the causes for anaemia. Studies show that 39 percent of girls aged 10 and 19 years and 21 percent of boys of the same age group suffer from anaemia in Nepal. Health authorities however, have been preparing the supplement administration programme only for girls.Health officials said that they have also been considering providing the supplement tablets to boys as well, as several countries have already started administering iron-folic acid to boys.Doctors say anaemia in adults can cause fatigue, lethargy, reduced physical productivity, and poor work performance. It is a major concern among pregnant women, as problems can lead to increased maternal mortality rates and poor birth outcomes.The Health Ministry has been providing the supplement at government schools across the country since 2016. Some local levels had already been administering the supplement tablets in private schools.Thapa said that all schools, whether government or private, will implement the supplementation programme from the new fiscal year. Under the programme, eligible girls will be administered a supplement tablet every week for three months. They will be administered the tablet again after three months and continued for 13 weeks. Thapa said that 26 supplement tablets will be administered per person in a year.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 conducted by the ministry shows that 43 percent of the children aged between six to 59 months have been found to be anaemic—25 percent mildly anaemic, 18 percent moderately anaemic and one percent severely anaemic.The prevalence of anaemia in children aged between six to 59 months has decreased from 53 percent in 2016 to 43 percent in 2022. However, the trend has not been consistently downward. In 2006, around 48 percent of children were found to be anaemic. Prevalence of anaemia in the above-mentioned age group was found to be high—50.6 percent in the Madhesh Province, followed by 48.9 percent in Lumbini, 45.4 percent in Sudurpaschim, 42.5 percent in Bagmati, 39.8 percent in Karnali, 33.9 percent in Koshi and 30.7 percent in Gandaki Province.Women living in the Tarai region are more likely to be anaemic (45 percent) than those living in the hills (20 percent) and in the mountainous regions (23 percent), the survey showed. More than half the women (52 percent) are anaemic in the Madhesh Province.In the 1990s, 75 percent of pregnant women in Nepal were found to be suffering from anaemia.Anaemia during pregnancy increases the risk of foetal growth retardation and low birth weight, premature delivery, increased perinatal mortality, and reduced resistance to infection for both mother and baby. Thapa said anaemia is a serious concern for children as it can impair their cognitive development and can have long-term health and economic implications for society.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it.

But after the Asian Cricket Council expanded the tournament, Nepal made their way into the main event as one of the two semi-finals, with the other being Thailand.And, now, they have created history.The UAE came at the tournament as Premier Cup champions and narrowly missed out on the 2024 Women’s T20 World Cup and were a favoured side in the tournament opener. They gave Nepal a brief scare when Kavisha Egodage (3-12) found the breakthrough wicket of Khadka’s opening partner Sita Rana Magar for seven in the 5.1 overs, removed Kabita Kunwar for two in the 7.1 overs and a dangerous Rubina Chhetri for 10 in the 13.3 overs. In between, Lavanya Keny dismissed Nepal skipper Indu Barma for six, which had temporarily slackened Nepal’s chase.But Khadka, who was opening the batting for the first time after 16 T20Is, held firm at the other end, soaking up all the pressure and taking full responsibility. She raced to fifty off just 35 balls and continued to cast her magic with patience and confidence before wrapping up the victory with an impressive four off UAE captain Esha Oza, leading Nepal to 118-4 in 16.1 overs.Khadka’s 72 runs was also the highest score by a Nepali batter in the Women’s Asia Cup. In the process, Khadka also became the first Nepali cricketer to score a half-century at the Women’s Asia Cup.Jyoti Pandey’s 16 against Sri Lanka in the 2016 Asia Cup was the previous best score for Nepal.Khadka’s 45-ball 72 is also the third highest score by a Nepali batter in Women’s T20I. Chhetri’s unbeaten 118 against Maldives in Bangi, Malaysia in February during the Women’s Premier Cup and Rana Magar’s unconquered 82 against Qatar during their T20I bilateral series in Doha in November 2021 stand as the first and second highest score by a woman cricketer for Nepal. \"I am very happy that I had the opportunity to make the country proud. I would like to thank everybody,\" player of the match Khadka said after the win.Earlier, Barma starred with the ball with three wickets and a run out helping Nepal restrict the UAE to 115-8 after sending the opponents to bat first.Nepal put the UAE on the back foot, with their captain Oza getting run out after making 10 in the second over and seamer Sabnam Rai bowling out Rinitha Rajith in the fourth over.However, once spinners Chhetri, Barma and Kabita Joshi were introduced, Nepal were more vicious.Barma dismissed Theertha Satish for nine in the sixth over and Samaira Dharnidharka for 13 in the eight, leaving the UAE at 46-4.Egodage’s 22 off 26, which featured two fours, and Khushi Sharma’s 36 off 39, that also included two boundaries, revived the UAE innings after the powerplay but Kritika Marasini undid Egodage in the 14.1 overs. Barma then worked with Kunwar to run out Heena Hotchandani for nine in 18.1 overs before having Sharma caught by Marasini two balls later. Vaishnave Mahesh departed next (run out) as the UAE lost three wickets for just six runs at the back end and were able to put up a below-par total.“It's a great win and we are very happy. It was our coach and captain's decision to make Samjhana open. We believe she can do well opening the batting. I am very happy with my team. They kept believing and I am very, very happy,” skipper Barma said.UAE captain Oza lamented that their team could not exploit a good wicket.“It was a pretty decent wicket and we didn't post a par total. Everybody got a good start but we couldn't convert, and losing three wickets in the powerplay isn't an ideal start. At times we were bowling too short. There were too many bad balls.Nepal play their second group match against Pakistan on Sunday, before facing defending champions and tournament favourites India on Tuesday. ","summary":"Samjhana Khadka scored an unbeaten half-century after Indu Barma took a three-wicket haul as Nepal brightly opened their 2024 ACC Women’s T20 Asia Cup with a convincing six-wicket victory over the United Arab Emirates in Dambulla, Sri Lanka on Friday.Needing 116 for victory, Khadka’s brilliant knock of 72 not out off 45 balls helped Nepal overhaul the target with 23 balls remaining.It was 24-year-old Khadka’s first career T20 International fifty and her half-century came at a perfect moment as her impeccable innings that included 11 boundaries and a strike rate of 160 gave Nepal their first ever victory at the Asian tournament.Nepal previously appeared at the Women’s Asia cup on two occasions—in 2012 in China and in 2016 in Thailand—and had played eight matches but had yet to win a single match in the biennial competition.After failing to qualify for the 2018 and 2022 editions of Asia Cup, they initially missed out on the 2024 Asia Cup after losing their ACC Women’s Premier Cup semi-finals to Malaysia in February this year.

However, the UAE finished the group on top and ahead of Nepal due to net run rate. Both the UAE and Nepal progressed to the knockouts as the top two teams.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

Coming on the heels of a poor performance in the first televised live debate by his opposition presidential candidate Joe Biden, the attack has helped the controversial Republican politician consolidate his vote bank. Luckily for him, he could raise his fist and chant “Fight, fight, fight” before being frisked away by Secret Service agents, bettering his chances of returning to the White House as undecided voters seem to buy his arguments about a plot against America. Violence against a candidate at the cusp of election only generates sympathy for them; having seen death up-close, Trump is now eyeing a resurrection of his political career.But no debate in the social media age follows the straight dichotomy of good versus evil or victim versus perpetrator. Taking cue from Trump’s own modus operandi of creating what he calls “alternative facts,” conspiracy theorists and some of his detractors have been calling the attack a plot by Trump himself to gain public sympathy. An old photo of him, with both his ears intact, has been doing the rounds on the internet, claiming that he was not injured at all. After all, this is the same man who was indicted for instigating an attack on Capitol Hill and trying to overturn the 2020 US presidential election results. From investigating crimes by him to now investigating a crime against him, US law enforcement and investigation agencies have an unexpected, rather strange, task in their hands.But amid the din of which of the old men returns to the White House as the 47th president of the United States of America or the motive of the 20-year-old Republican voter-turned-gunman or even the misgivings about Trump’s victimhood, an age-old question of gun culture has made a comeback. American gun culture has a central role in the assassination attempt on Trump, and Trump himself is one of the fiercest defenders of such a culture. And if anyone thinks Trump will now rethink his love for guns, one of his advisers, Chris LaCivita, has clarified that the ex-president will continue to protect gun rights. For the Republicans, the constitutional guarantee offered by the Second Amendment for individuals to carry guns is sacrosanct; Trump will potentially continue to exploit the Americans’ emotional attachment to the gun as a self-defense instrument.Such is the gun obsession in the United States, even after seeing the assassination of four presidents—Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley and John F. Kennedy—and assassination attempts on Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W Bush, among others, the country is helpless to do much about it. The comfort of amnesia is too dear to America when it comes to dealing with the tough question of gun violence. And with a morally repugnant record of supplying arms to Israel in its attempts to wipe out the Palestinians, Trump’s opponent and sitting president Joe Biden is lost for words. The United States should really unite to wipe out gun culture.

There are a few things for which even those from developed countries praise Nepal and in which we Nepalis can take great pride.

Dalits, women and other oppressed communities fought long for their representation. But it was after the success of the people’s movement in 2006 that the enforcement of inclusive policy in state agencies started to be strengthened.

It’s not only Oli who has ignored the call for inclusivity in his Cabinet. The same trend had been in evidence in the past. The immediate past prime minister and CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who often boasts of introducing an inclusive system in the country, didn’t appoint a single minister from the Dalit community in his last Cabinet. This is a serious concern. Having a progressive constitution and laws doesn’t mean much if the leaders in the driving seats of the executive agencies trample on its spirit. If there is a community that is most discriminated against, it is the Dalits and they therefore deserve priority for representation under an inclusive system.

The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource. ","summary":"Scores of people have been killed in landslides, floods and other monsoon-induced disasters within a month of the monsoon entering Nepal in the second week of June. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places.

Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy.

We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy.

As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  ","summary":"The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli.

The National Examination Board had enforced the ‘non-graded’ category from this year. The underperformance of the majority of school students has stirred a fresh debate about the test system. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former National Planning Commission member Usha Jha, who led the committee that recommended the government to adopt the letter grading system.How do you analyse the SEE results published on Thursday?People have reacted to it with shock, not me. In fact, on the basis of the teaching system that is being practised in our schools, I think the results are good. We get the results based on what and how we teach students. Over 52 percent of students have been categorised as non-graded. We need to identify and address the causes behind the bad results. I have heard some people blame the letter grading system. This is wrong. A form of letter grading system was already there. We only suggested an upgraded form of the system. If we start blaming the system, we won’t find the real cause of the problem. What may be the real causes that you are hinting at?The first is the poor quality of teachers in our country. A form of letter grading system was there even before. But it had two loopholes. First, the government took an approach whereby all students would pass. That gave an impression to the students that they don’t need to study hard. That degraded the quality of their education. Second, there was a system of giving marks based on the students’ performances in theoretical and practical exams. Of the total 100 marks, the practical exams made up 35 marks. Most students were given maximum marks in the practical exams. That helped them get higher grades even if they didn’t do well in theoretical exams. This system encouraged students to neglect theoretical studies. That has caused huge damage to our education system. The letter grade system introduced this year has closed those loopholes. But the letter grading system requires a learning environment. The system was introduced without adequate preparation for its effective implementation. Also, the Covid pandemic disturbed preparatory works at the time. We should have drastically improved classroom teaching practices, and trained teachers across the country because their teaching methods are outdated. They weren’t trained on the grading system. They give lectures and encourage students to memorise while the letter grading system requires a thorough process and encourages result-oriented learning. It doesn’t prioritise marks. Our teachers and schools lacked the capacity to implement the new system. Teachers weren’t trained and prepared. Even now, most teachers don’t know what the letter grading system is. The system is necessary to make our students compete in global markets.While we upgraded the system, we didn’t upgrade the schools and teachers. Our teachers engage only in routine and formal responsibilities such as completing textbook courses before the examinations. This system should be properly internalised not only by teachers and students but also school management, palikas [local units] and parents of the students. Only then can it be effectively implemented. These are the major reasons behind the poor results. How is the students’ performance evaluated in the letter grading system?First, teachers should study a lot. They take reference of the subject matter from the textbook and teach students giving a broader perspective of the matter. They have to engage the students practically on the issue. The students should be regularly evaluated based on their participation and response in study and activities. The teachers should teach them and constantly monitor whether they are learning and making progress. The marking should be based on that. So, in this system, the examination starts from day 1 and everyday activities contribute to their marks. It also takes other activities such as behaviour, understanding, presentation into consideration. Therefore, it is called a regular assessment system based on a thorough process, unlike the traditional three-hour-long yearly examination method. If the teachers aren’t competent to carry out these activities, this idea can’t yield good results. They badly need capacity enhancement. The pedagogy should be remodelled.What was the rationale behind the decision to implement this system?One reason was to upgrade our education’s standard on par with the international standards and make our students fit for global markets. In the course of formulating this policy, we undertook a comprehensive research of international practices. Based on that evidence-based research, we submitted a report to then education minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. The government studied and endorsed it. Basically, this system was introduced with an objective of upgrading our education system in the changed context. But we lacked preparations to implement this idea.We will make a mistake if we change this system. I heard that the education minister [Sumana Shrestha] decided to make some changes in the policy and allow all non-graded students to sit for chance examinations, whereas the system says only those students who secured non-grades in two subjects can retake exams for the same subjects. There is no point in changing the method to favour even the students who have failed in all the subjects. She should have made it clear what factors made her change the criteria overnight. I cannot understand why the minister made the decision in a haste without considering its impact.In fact, our next step should have been capacity enhancement of teachers. The minister took some right decisions such as separating teachers from political parties. But an incumbent minister changing a system that was implemented by a previous minister would cause a problem. She could have formed a panel to conduct a study to find if the letter grading system is the main cause behind the students’ underperformance. But changing a policy through an order didn’t look good.Results show our students are very poor in mathematics, science and English. What could be the reasons?This is unfortunate. We saw similar trends in previous years as well. Mathematics and science are becoming more challenging. One reason is the lack of sufficient teachers for these subjects. Also, some teachers are under-utilised. Some teachers don’t go to the schools. So special measures need to be taken to manage teachers mainly for these subjects. Otherwise, we will have similar results in the coming years.The committee under your leadership recommended that those getting a GPA below 1.6 have to choose technical courses and those willing to study Grade 11 must score above 1.6 GPA. What was the idea behind that recommendation?The idea was to end the situation of halting students’ study and activities because of their lower grades. We have a government body in the form of the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) which has been offering dozens of vocational training based on the needs and interests of people. So our youths can join a suitable CTEVT course. We need more people in vocational fields. Skilled people aren’t available in the country. A large number of people working in technical fields in Nepal are from India. We included the provision in consultation with CTEVT officials. Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel had also prepared a broad plan to implement the letter grading system and integrate the vocational part in our education system. The present government should improve the education system by enhancing teachers’ capacity and encouraging youths to join vocational training to fill the gaps in the employment market. Are the infrastructure and resources available in our education system sufficient to implement the grading system?Some schools lack even essential resources while in some we find misuse or underuse of resources. So, our education ministry should carry out a comprehensive mapping and find where teachers are required, where they are underutilised and where they are idle. Then, the government can make optimum use of the teachers and make additional investment on need-basis. Such an approach will yield better results. In general, our academic institutions lack resources as there is a trend of allocating insufficient budgets for the education sector. Yes, the letter grading system needs more investment. We have to work on teachers’ capacity enhancement and to provide learning materials to students. When you make an activity participatory, you certainly need resources and investments.Do we need to review our teacher recruitment process and our pedagogy in the universities that produce teachers?The government can consider new requirements while recruiting teachers and train them accordingly. Also, we need to update our curriculum and pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. I have doubts about the quality of our graduates, post-graduates and even PhD holders due to the poor teaching and learning environment of our academic institutions. There is a need for more coordination and collaboration between the government and universities to address such issues.In the end, I want to stress that the government should adopt a clear and consistent policy and avoid ad-hoc decisions. The letter grading system is the best and we should push for that despite the challenges in its implementation. Just that it should have been enforced after enhancing teachers’ capacity. The problems we have now are due to lack of preparation. ","summary":"In the Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) conducted this year, over 52 percent of students failed to graduate to grade 11. The National Examination Board had enforced the ‘non-graded’ category from this year. The underperformance of the majority of school students has stirred a fresh debate about the test system. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former National Planning Commission member Usha Jha, who led the committee that recommended the government to adopt the letter grading system.How do you analyse the SEE results published on Thursday?People have reacted to it with shock, not me. In fact, on the basis of the teaching system that is being practised in our schools, I think the results are good. We get the results based on what and how we teach students. Over 52 percent of students have been categorised as non-graded. We need to identify and address the causes behind the bad results. I have heard some people blame the letter grading system. This is wrong. A form of letter grading system was already there. We only suggested an upgraded form of the system. If we start blaming the system, we won’t find the real cause of the problem. What may be the real causes that you are hinting at?The first is the poor quality of teachers in our country. A form of letter grading system was there even before. But it had two loopholes. First, the government took an approach whereby all students would pass. That gave an impression to the students that they don’t need to study hard. That degraded the quality of their education. Second, there was a system of giving marks based on the students’ performances in theoretical and practical exams. Of the total 100 marks, the practical exams made up 35 marks. Most students were given maximum marks in the practical exams. That helped them get higher grades even if they didn’t do well in theoretical exams. This system encouraged students to neglect theoretical studies. That has caused huge damage to our education system. The letter grade system introduced this year has closed those loopholes. But the letter grading system requires a learning environment. The system was introduced without adequate preparation for its effective implementation. Also, the Covid pandemic disturbed preparatory works at the time. We should have drastically improved classroom teaching practices, and trained teachers across the country because their teaching methods are outdated. They weren’t trained on the grading system. They give lectures and encourage students to memorise while the letter grading system requires a thorough process and encourages result-oriented learning. It doesn’t prioritise marks. Our teachers and schools lacked the capacity to implement the new system. Teachers weren’t trained and prepared. Even now, most teachers don’t know what the letter grading system is. The system is necessary to make our students compete in global markets.While we upgraded the system, we didn’t upgrade the schools and teachers. Our teachers engage only in routine and formal responsibilities such as completing textbook courses before the examinations. This system should be properly internalised not only by teachers and students but also school management, palikas [local units] and parents of the students. Only then can it be effectively implemented. These are the major reasons behind the poor results. How is the students’ performance evaluated in the letter grading system?First, teachers should study a lot. They take reference of the subject matter from the textbook and teach students giving a broader perspective of the matter. They have to engage the students practically on the issue. The students should be regularly evaluated based on their participation and response in study and activities. The teachers should teach them and constantly monitor whether they are learning and making progress. The marking should be based on that. So, in this system, the examination starts from day 1 and everyday activities contribute to their marks. It also takes other activities such as behaviour, understanding, presentation into consideration. Therefore, it is called a regular assessment system based on a thorough process, unlike the traditional three-hour-long yearly examination method. If the teachers aren’t competent to carry out these activities, this idea can’t yield good results. They badly need capacity enhancement. The pedagogy should be remodelled.What was the rationale behind the decision to implement this system?One reason was to upgrade our education’s standard on par with the international standards and make our students fit for global markets. In the course of formulating this policy, we undertook a comprehensive research of international practices. Based on that evidence-based research, we submitted a report to then education minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. The government studied and endorsed it. Basically, this system was introduced with an objective of upgrading our education system in the changed context. But we lacked preparations to implement this idea.We will make a mistake if we change this system. I heard that the education minister [Sumana Shrestha] decided to make some changes in the policy and allow all non-graded students to sit for chance examinations, whereas the system says only those students who secured non-grades in two subjects can retake exams for the same subjects. There is no point in changing the method to favour even the students who have failed in all the subjects. She should have made it clear what factors made her change the criteria overnight. I cannot understand why the minister made the decision in a haste without considering its impact.In fact, our next step should have been capacity enhancement of teachers. The minister took some right decisions such as separating teachers from political parties. But an incumbent minister changing a system that was implemented by a previous minister would cause a problem. She could have formed a panel to conduct a study to find if the letter grading system is the main cause behind the students’ underperformance.

What are the takeaways of the prime minister’s Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government’s decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country’s foreign policy doesn’t change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government’s priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn’t it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn’t affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country’s ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person’s affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn’t seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister’s New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister’s visit doesn’t reflect any misgivings about the government’s decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn’t reflect that. Why aren’t we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country’s views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don’t see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats’ relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don’t get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country’s influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let’s move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister’s level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister’s emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal’s official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister’s Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report’s submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India’s facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour’s support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India’s infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal’s electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven’t developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don’t envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn’t the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects—domestic as well as international use—of the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It’s been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why haven’t we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon.

So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister’s level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere.

Our prime minister’s emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal’s official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister’s Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report’s submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India’s facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour’s support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India’s infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal’s electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven’t developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don’t envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn’t the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects—domestic as well as international use—of the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It’s been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why haven’t we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon.
