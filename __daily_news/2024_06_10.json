We will need your positive support and blessings more than ever.\"\n"},{"hash":"42a9a7093b095b2c364fa651c951b4ad462d8c20fe108f7408c3e4fee940a27d","title":"pm-dahal-attends-modi-s-swearing-in-ceremony-1","date":1718044181631,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/global/pm-dahal-attends-modi-s-swearing-in-ceremony-1","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/pam_india1717987557_1024.jpg","category":"global","content":"\nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' has attended the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday evening.PM Dahal attended the ceremony organized in the Rastrapati Bhawan of India, according to Nepali Embassy in New Delhi.\nIndian President Droupadi Murmu administered the oath of office and secrecy to PM Modi for the third term.\nThe function was also attended by Sri Lankan President, Ranil Wickremesinghe; Maldivian President, Mohamed Muizzu; Bangladeshi Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina; Bhutanese Prime Minister, Tshering Tobgay, and Mauritian Prime Minister, Pravind Kumar Jugnauth, among other dignitaries.\nSimilarly, newly appointed ministers of India also took the oath on Sunday itself.\nThe function was also attended by leaders of various political parties and public figures.\nHe is accompanied by his daughter Ganga Dahal, Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, Padam Giri, Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal and other high level government officials.PM Dahal is scheduled to return home  today.\n\n","summary":"\nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' has attended the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday evening.PM Dahal attended the ceremony organized in the Rastrapati Bhawan of India, according to Nepali Embassy in New Delhi.\nIndian President Droupadi Murmu administered the oath of office and secrecy to PM Modi for the third term.\nThe function was also attended by Sri Lankan President, Ranil Wickremesinghe; Maldivian President, Mohamed Muizzu; Bangladeshi Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina; Bhutanese Prime Minister, Tshering Tobgay, and Mauritian Prime Minister, Pravind Kumar Jugnauth, among other dignitaries.\nSimilarly, newly appointed ministers of India also took the oath on Sunday itself.\nThe function was also attended by leaders of various political parties and public figures.\nHe is accompanied by his daughter Ganga Dahal, Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, Padam Giri, Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal and other high level government officials.PM Dahal is scheduled to return home  today.\n\n"},{"hash":"d42751af666bb8a2feaf724db7a1f3540afcf7b4d86e8403c1bb0978ba36040e","title":"prime-minister-prachanda-leaves-for-india","date":1717891200000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/nation/prime-minister-prachanda-leaves-for-india","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/PM_Prachanda_Modi_sapath_1000x5001717921700_1024.jpg","category":"nation","content":"\n Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' embarked on an India visit today to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi.\nPM Dahal was bade farewell by Speaker of the House of Representatives, Devraj Ghimire, National Assembly Chairperson, Narayan Dahal, Deputy Prime Ministers Raghubir Mahaseth and Narayankaji Shrestha, ministers, parliamentarians, high-ranking officials of the Government of Nepal and Chiefs of security agencies.\nOn the occasion, a contingent of the Nepali Army offered a guard of honour to PM Dahal who is visiting India at the cordial invitation of Indian PM Modi.\nThe Prime Minister is accompanied by his daughter Ganga Dahal, the Minister for Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs, Padam Giri, and senior officials of the government.\nBharatiya Janata Party's leader Modi is scheduled to take oath as the Prime Minister for the third stint this evening in the Indian capital city Delhi.\nThe Heads of State and Governments from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Mauritius were also invited by the Indian government to attend the swearing-in ceremony, it is learned.\nPM Dahal would hold a meeting with his Indian counterpart Modi today itself, according to the Nepali Embassy in New Delhi.

The agency has supported awareness-raising programs, provided free surgeries, and strengthened the capacity of healthcare providers.\n\"UNFPA is committed to working with the government and partners to accelerate progress towards ending fistula by 2030 in Nepal,\" said Won Young Hong, Representative for UNFPA Nepal. \"We urge all stakeholders to redouble their efforts to ensure that no woman is left behind.\"\nTo expand access to advanced fistula repair surgeries, UNFPA Nepal together with the Ministry of Health and Population will establish a fistula treatment center at the Paropkar Maternity Hospital. The center will provide state-of-the-art care for women with fistula, through a referral network with other hospitals across the country.\nUNFPA pledges its continued support to the government in implementing the roadmap, including through a district-by-district elimination campaign focusing on prevention, case management, and rehabilitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"hash":"8bfa419360b048b7c7ad3ba581531a1db6a9ea7d86d74b0d1197959a0eb1c76a","title":"dengue-cases-found-in-57-districts","date":1716508800000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/health/dengue-cases-found-in-57-districts","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/kushtia_dengue_6yr_old_child_dies_of_dengue_in_kushtia_daily_bangladesh_16941828191697183214_1024.jpg","category":"health","content":"\nWith the start of rainfall, cases of dengue have started increasing.

The report forecasts that Nepal will generate 1.22 million jobs in 2024.The jobs generated by the tourism sector is 15.2 percent of the total. The London-based organisation said travel and tourism’s total contribution to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) stood at 6.6 percent to Rs358.9 billion or $2.7 billion last year, down from 6.7 percent in 2019 before the start of the Covid pandemic.All values are in constant 2023 prices and exchange rates. This primarily reflects the economic activity generated by sectors such as hotels, travel agencies, airlines and other passenger transport services, excluding commuter services. It also includes, for example, the activities of the restaurant and leisure industries directly supported by tourists.The annual report said domestic visitors are the biggest spenders who spent Rs210.8 billion last year and are expected to fork out Rs226.8 billion this year. This translates to 71.5 percent of the total spending in the tourism sector. Nepalis started touring their own country in significant numbers after the 2015 earthquake, according to hoteliers.Apart from traditional leisure destinations like Pokhara and Chitwan, the famous Annapurna Base Camp trail, Mardi and Manaslu treks were the big draw for domestic adventurers. But the Covid pandemic had put a damper on tourism.“Domestic tourism has now fully recovered,” said Mani Raj Lamichhane, director at the Research, Planning and Monitoring Department of Nepal Tourism Board (NTB).“There is no actual data on domestic movement but based on the occupancies reported by hotels in key tourism hubs like Pokhara and Chitwan, the domestic tourist growth has been phenomenal,” said Lamichhane.“Due to bad roads, domestic tourist movement in Lumbini, however, has dropped significantly, even though Pokhara has not been much affected.” Domestic airlines are reporting robust passenger traffic in destinations like Pokhara, Bhairahawa and Bharatpur due to the ongoing road expansion projects. “We are operating 40 flights [landing and takeoff] from the Pokhara International Airport, with the number of flights doubling in the past six months,” said Dipendra Karna, communication manager at Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier. Buddha operates 34 flights on the Pokhara-Kathmandu-Pokhara route and connects Nepalgunj, Bhairahawa and Bharatpur with Pokhara. On April 14, Buddha Air recorded the highest-ever single-day passenger traffic, flying 3,000 passengers in and out of Pokhara.Karna said passengers in key tourist destinations are mostly Nepalis followed by Indians. “We are 95 percent occupied in Pokhara,” said Karna.Besides, the number of sightseers travelling from Beni to Jomsom by motorcycle has also risen sharply after the construction of the Beni-Jomsom road. According to the report, international visitors spent an estimated Rs83.9 billion or $633.7 million last year. This spending is projected to grow to Rs102.6 billion in 2024.Of the total expenditure, 83.4 percent was spent on leisure and the remaining on business. The country welcomed more than a million tourists between January and December last year, following China’s border reopening and record arrivals from India. According to the Nepal Tourism Board, the country's tourism promotional body, the arrival numbers crossed the million mark for the first time in four years.The government, through the budget, has announced to draw 1.6 million foreign visitors this year.According to industry insiders, the government’s target is attainable, but there are a few challenges this year.From November 8, Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport will be closed daily for 10 hours, from 10 pm to 8 am for five months until March 31, for the expansion of the taxiways.September-November is Nepal’s peak tourist season. “The construction in the peak season will reduce flight frequency and as a result, airfare may rise,” said Lamichhane. Subash Jha, spokesperson at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport, said that at least 12 flights may be affected. “As there are no parking slots during daytime, rescheduling will be difficult. We, however, have requested airline companies to use Nepal’s two new international airports in Pokhara and Bhairahawa. We are ready to facilitate them.”Jha said a round of discussion with a few foreign airlines has been completed to ensure the flights do not suffer. “It will depend on airlines whether they are willing to operate from the new airports. We, however, cannot force them.”Besides, industry insiders say the Nepal Tourism Board has been headless for the past four months, affecting all international promotional and marketing events.Foreign arrivals had crossed the one million mark for the first time in 2018 when the country hosted 1.17 million visitors from abroad. The number reached 1.19 million in 2019. Then the Covid pandemic started in early 2020, bringing arrivals to a standstill. Travel restrictions and an economic slowdown triggered by the pandemic delivered a massive blow to Nepal's burgeoning tourism industry, decimating revenues and profits after 2020.Nepal received 230,085 and 150,962 tourists in 2020 and 2021, respectively. In 2022, the foreign tourist numbers shot up to 614,869. ","summary":"Nepal’s tourism sector generated Rs327.9 billion ($2.5 billion) in revenue and supported 1.19 million jobs directly and indirectly last year, according to the recently released annual World Travel and Tourism Council research report. The report forecasts that Nepal will generate 1.22 million jobs in 2024.The jobs generated by the tourism sector is 15.2 percent of the total. The London-based organisation said travel and tourism’s total contribution to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) stood at 6.6 percent to Rs358.9 billion or $2.7 billion last year, down from 6.7 percent in 2019 before the start of the Covid pandemic.All values are in constant 2023 prices and exchange rates. This primarily reflects the economic activity generated by sectors such as hotels, travel agencies, airlines and other passenger transport services, excluding commuter services. It also includes, for example, the activities of the restaurant and leisure industries directly supported by tourists.The annual report said domestic visitors are the biggest spenders who spent Rs210.8 billion last year and are expected to fork out Rs226.8 billion this year. This translates to 71.5 percent of the total spending in the tourism sector. Nepalis started touring their own country in significant numbers after the 2015 earthquake, according to hoteliers.Apart from traditional leisure destinations like Pokhara and Chitwan, the famous Annapurna Base Camp trail, Mardi and Manaslu treks were the big draw for domestic adventurers.

The court asked the commission and other authorities to put the process on hold, and the case is still sub judice. When the court gives a verdict on the issue, the JSP-Nepal's fence-sitters may decide whether to remain with the party or defect to the new outfit.Just a week before the unity general convention, the party suffered another setback as it had to give up the chief minister’s post in Madhesh Province when the erstwhile coalition partners–the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre)—withdrew their support to the government. During the floor test held on June 5 JSP-Nepal lawmaker Saroj Kumar Yadav, the immediate past chief minister of the province, fell 4 votes short from securing the position. When he garnered 50 votes in support, 53 members voted against him. In the 107-strong assembly, the chief minister has to secure at least 54 votes in support.Upendra Yadav's parties, including the current JSP-Nepal, continuously led the provincial government for almost seven years until Satish Kumar Singh of the Janamat Party dethroned Yadav’s party from the chief ministerial position on June 7.Though the recent party split and the dethroning of the Madhesh Province’s leadership can be blamed on the party leadership, according to analysts, the unity general convention poses little challenge to Yadav. Because of the split, there are no leaders left in the party who’d challenge Yadav, Chandra Kishore, an observer of Madhesh politics, told the Post. “Therefore, the general convention should be a walk in the park for him.” The party that held its statute convention last year adopted a policy of lobbying for a directly elected presidential system in the country. Likewise, the Madhesh-based party set the goal of fighting for a parliament with fully proportional representation. This is expected to direct policy at the unity convention. However, experts question the sustainability of the policies adopted by the statute convention in the party's post-split situation.“The policies adopted by the statute convention will remain intact,” Prakash Adhikari, a federal lawmaker of the party, told the Post. “The party division, which is sub judice in the Supreme Court, will not impact policy changes.”Chandra Kishore, who has been following Madhesh politics for a long time, differs from Adhikari.“Yadav is a political strategist. He acts as per the situation,” he said. “He will not necessarily act as per the party documents.” The JSP-Nepal’s central committee in January, two months before the split, decided to hold the unity general convention in June. The party decided to organise the convention in order to consolidate the unity between various Madhes-based parties over time, party leaders said.This is the first unity convention held after the merger of various Madhes-based parties, Manish Kumar Suman, spokesperson for the JSP-Nepal, told the Post.The Tarai Madhesh Loktantrik Party, led by Mahantha Thakur; the Rastriya Madhesh Samajbadi Party, led by Sarat Singh Bhandari; the Tarai Madhesh Sadbhawana Party, led by Mahendra Yadav’ the Sadbhawana Party, led by Rajendra Mahato; the Madheshi Janadhikar Ganatantrik Party, led by Raj Kishor Yadav; and Anil Jha’s Nepal Sadbhawana Party merged to form the Rastriya Janata Party before the 2017 general and provincial elections.The Rastriya Janata Party and the Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party led by Upendra Yadav fought the 2017 elections with a tie-up in Madhesh but merged the parties in 2020 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party. When the erstwhile prime minister KP Sharma Oli issued an ordinance to split the Yadav-led party to counterbalance a rift within his Nepal Communist Party (NCP) formed after the merger of the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) following the 2017 election, the merger in the two Madhesh-based parties was hastened. Before this, the only Madheshi party to hold the general convention periodically was the Nepal Sadbhawana Party. Gajendra Narayan Singh, who formed the Nepal Sadbhabana Council in 1985, turned the council into a party following the first people’s movement of 1990.Yadav’s will be another Madhesh-based party to hold the general convention more than once, Suman said.Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates a political party to hold its general convention at least once in five years. However, if the office bearers cannot be elected in five years due to a situation arising out of special circumstances, based on the statute of a political party, new leaders can be elected within six months thereafter. The constitutional time frame is not mandatory for a new party or one formed after a split. As Nepal’s regional parties often suffer splits, they rarely hold the general convention periodically.The Upendra Yadav-led Madheshi Janadhikar Forum (MJF) held its second convention in 2009, in Birgunj, just after the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. The MJF was a rights-based organisation before it entered politics after the first Madhesh uprising of 2007. JSP-Nepal spokesperson Suman said Yadav has led various political parties, but this is the second time an outfit he leads is holding the general convention.The Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar-led Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (Loktantrik) held its first general convention in Biratnagar in May 2016. The same year, Nepal Sadbhawana Party also held its general conventions in April.The JSP-Nepal has invited foreign dignitaries to the unity convention. The party's foreign affairs department chief, Arjun Thapa, said delegates from India, Malaysia, Azerbaijan, Spain, and Indonesia have already arrived in Nepal.Invitations have been extended to various parties, except the Janata Samajbadi Party led by Ashok Rai, which splintered from the JSP-Nepal. The Nepali Congress, the UML, the Maoist Centre, the Rastriya Swatantra Party, the Rastriya Prajantra Party, and the CPN (Unified Socialist) are other parties that will participate in the Janakpur convention. Party leaders say the opening ceremony will be held on Monday, whereas the closed session, which will discuss the party’s political documents, is scheduled for the subsequent days.

The country’s limited resources cannot pay for their relocation.Experts from the authority say that most districts in the Tarai could be affected by flooding this rainy season. The vulnerable places include Rapti-Sonari Rural Municipality of Banke, Bardiya, Tikapur of Kailali, Triveni-Susta Rural Municipality of Nawalparasi West, Kalahari Rural Municipality of Morang, and several places of Rautahat.Several places in West Rukum, Jajarkot, Helambu, and Melamchi of Sindhupalchok, Sangurigadhi Rural Municipality of Dhankuta, Maiwakhola Rural Municipality of Taplejung, and Chumnubri of Gorkha are designated as most vulnerable to landslides during the monsoon, due to begin this week. The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology predicts above-average rainfall this year, with the added risk of flooding and landslides.“We are not doing anything for the prevention of disasters or the relocation of the most vulnerable populations to safety,” said Mahendra Shrestha, former chief specialist at the Ministry of Health and Population. “Concerned authorities have made a preparedness plan, but there is nothing about prevention.”Monsoon in Nepal is a season of epidemics, with thousands of people across the country getting infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases. Snakebite incidents and resulting deaths are also common during the season but the phenomenon, which experts dub “a lurking invisible crisis”, remains grossly neglected.

The elections have not only reshaped the landscape of Indian politics but also highlighted the evolving nature of voter behaviour, coalition politics and regional influences. This piece delves into the key aspects of the elections, examining the performance of major political parties, the role of coalition partners, the resurgence of the Indian National Congress (INC) and the implications for future governance.BJP: Dominant yet challengedThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, emerged as the single largest party in the 2024 elections but fell short of securing a majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament. The BJP secured 240 seats, a significant drop from the 303 seats it held in the previous term. This shortfall underscores a shift in voter sentiment. It presents challenges for the party as it seeks to form a stable government with the help of its coalition partners in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).The BJP's performance in key states like Uttar Pradesh (UP), Maharashtra and West Bengal was particularly telling. Despite strong pre-election predictions and robust campaigning, the party experienced setbacks in these crucial states, which play a pivotal role in determining the overall outcome of national elections. The loss of significant seats in these regions indicates the limitations of a centrally driven campaign and highlights the importance of addressing state-specific issues and dynamics.Coalition dynamicsThe reliance on coalition partners has become increasingly apparent for the BJP. The return of key allies such as Janata Dal (United) [JDU] and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) to the NDA fold reflects the necessity of strategic alliances in the current political scenario. Both the JDU and the TDP had previously exited the coalition but were brought back into the fold as the BJP recognised the need for additional support to secure a majority.The demands from coalition partners for significant cabinet positions, such as Home Ministry for the JDU and Speaker for the TDP, highlight the high stakes involved in these alliances. The coalition partners' leverage underscores their strategic importance and the need for the BJP to carefully manage these relationships to ensure a cohesive and stable government. The negotiations and compromises required in this context are indicative of the complex dynamics that underpin coalition politics in India.Resurgent CongressOne notable outcome of the 2024 elections has been the resurgence of the Indian National Congress (INC). The Congress increased its seat count to 99, significantly improving from the 52 seats it held in the previous term. This resurgence is attributed to a focused campaign strategy that emphasised social justice themes, caste mobilisation and economic inequality. Rahul Gandhi, the Congress leader, maintained a consistent message that resonated with various voter demographics, particularly in rural and Dalit constituencies.The Congress's ability to secure the position of opposition leader marks a significant recovery and positions the party as a formidable force in the opposition. Its success in mobilising support through a well-coordinated campaign and strategic alliances with other opposition parties reflects a shift in voter sentiment and a demand for an alternative to the BJP's narrative.INDIAThe INDIA alliance, comprising various opposition parties, demonstrated surprising traction despite lacking a single leader or a common platform. This alliance coordinated effectively and presented a united front, even with internal differences and challenges. The focus on regional issues and local alliances played a crucial role in their electoral gains, as evidenced by the understanding between the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Punjab.INDIA alliance's ability to gain significant ground despite being outspent and facing various obstacles, such as arrests and frozen bank accounts, underscores the importance of coalition politics in India. The alliance's success in mobilising voters and presenting a credible alternative to the BJP highlights the potential for opposition parties to challenge the dominant narrative and influence the political discourse.Regional dynamics The 2024 elections reinforced the complexity of regional dynamics in Indian politics. States like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and West Bengal played pivotal roles in shaping the overall outcome. The BJP's underperformance in these states, despite strong pre-election predictions, indicates the limitations of national campaigns and the importance of state-specific strategies.In Uttar Pradesh, for example, the NDA won only 37 of the state's 80 seats. Various factors contributed to this outcome, including local anti-incumbency, strategic candidate nominations and effective opposition alliances. The election results in Maharashtra and West Bengal also highlighted the significance of regional dynamics, with local issues and alliances playing crucial roles in determining voter behaviour.Hindutva and identity politicsThe BJP's strategy of leveraging Hindutva and divisive identity politics appeared to have limited success in this election. High-profile speeches and inflammatory rhetoric by BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Modi, did not translate into expected electoral gains in key constituencies like Ayodhya and Banswara. This outcome suggests a possible voter fatigue with polarising narratives and a demand for governance focused on development and economic issues.The mixed outcome of identity politics indicates the evolving nature of voter behaviour in India. While such strategies have proven effective in the past, their limited success in the 2024 elections suggests a growing demand for inclusive governance and a focus on substantive issues that impact the everyday lives of voters.The path forwardAs the BJP prepares to form a new government on June 8, the challenges of navigating coalition politics and addressing diverse regional expectations will be paramount. The necessity for a \"grand federal bargain\" and the accommodation of various regional interests will be crucial for maintaining stability and ensuring effective governance.The upcoming state elections in Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand will serve as further litmus tests for the BJP's strategies and coalition management. The ability to secure victories in these states will significantly influence the power dynamics within the NDA and impact the broader political landscape.The ruling party's ability to address regional aspirations, manage coalition dynamics, and focus on inclusive development will shape the future governance landscape in India. The 2024 elections have underscored the importance of strategic alliances, the evolving nature of voter behaviour, and the need for a governance approach that transcends polarising narratives and addresses the substantive issues facing the nation.

It is over Hamas’ demand ... that we commit to stopping the war without achieving our goals of eliminating Hamas.... I am not prepared to do so.”Hamas, for its part, said Washington must push its ally Israel to halt the fighting.“We call upon the US administration to put pressure on the occupation to stop the war on Gaza, and the Hamas movement is ready to deal positively with any initiative that secures an end to the war,” senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters.The war has now entered its ninth month, since Hamas-led fighters killed 1,200 people and took some 250 others hostage in a rampage through southern Israel. In response, Israel launched an assault on the Gaza Strip that has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians and reduced most of the enclave to wasteland.Palestinian officials said 40 more bodies arrived in hospitals over the past 24 hours. Thousands more dead are believed buried under rubble.ASSAULTS IN RAFAH, NUSEIRATIn Rafah, the city on the southern edge of Gaza where Israel launched an offensive last month in defiance of White House pleas, residents said on Monday tanks had been trying to thrust deeper towards the north in the early hours of the morning. They were on the edge of Shaboura, one of the most densely populated neighborhoods at the heart of the city.Around half of the Gaza Strip’s 2.3 million people had been sheltering in Rafah before last month’s assault, and a million have had to flee again.Since last week, Israel has also launched a large assault in the central Gaza Strip, around the small city of Deir al-Balah, the last population centre yet to be stormed. On Monday, residents said the Israelis had pulled back from some areas there but were keeping up air strikes and shelling.Residents in Nuseirat north of Deir al-Balah were still clearing debris after Israel freed four hostages in a massive raid there on Saturday. Palestinian officials say 274 people were killed, making it of the deadliest assaults of the war. Israeli forces said they were aware of under 100 Palestinians killed there and did not know how many were combatants.“We are exhausted and helpless, enough is enough,” said Jehad, who fled under fire from Saturday’s assault in Nuseirat with his family and was now in Deir al-Balah, speaking by text message. The family had already been displaced from Gaza City to Nuseirat, to Khan Younis, to Rafah and back to Nuseirat before their latest flight.In video obtained by Reuters from Nuseirat, resident Anas Alyan, standing outside the ruins of his home, described how Israel commandos wearing shorts had appeared in the streets, firing wildly while F-16s and quadcopters fired from the air.“Anyone moving in the street was killed - anyone moving, or walking, was killed immediately,” he said. “There are still children under this building. We don’t know how to pull them out,” he said, pointing to one ruin. “Today we found children martyred in that building,” he said, pointing to another.After months of failed peace efforts, Biden chose a new tack with his public announcement of his proposal for a ceasefire on May 31, describing it as an offer already accepted by Israel. US officials say Biden deliberately unveiled it without asking the Israelis first, to increase pressure for a deal.Washington is now seeking a vote backing the ceasefire proposal at the U.N. Security Council.Full details of the proposal have not been publicly disclosed, but the offer as described by US officials is similar to texts floated since January in previous failed peace efforts: a long truce, over several stages, with gradual release of Israeli hostages ultimately leading to an end to the war.What is different this time is that Israeli forces have now stormed most territory inside Gaza at least once, and Netanyahu is under greater domestic political pressure to reach a deal. Fighting has also escalated sharply in northern Israel along the Lebanese border, raising the threat of an all-out war between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah armed group.Benny Gantz, a popular centrist former military chief, quit Israel’s war cabinet on Sunday over what he described as the failure to outline a plan for the war’s end. That leaves Netanyahu more reliant on far right allies who say they will bring down his government if he agrees any deal that leaves Hamas in power.

Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces.

Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces.

Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will fly to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in, and the two prime ministers will hold a meeting after the ceremony, according to government officials. A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime minister’s visit to India. It will be a two-day trip, says Rekha Sharma, Minister for Communication and Information Technology. On Wednesday, Modi phoned Prime Minister Dahal and they briefly discussed the upcoming meeting, according to government officials.Modi is set to become the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to serve three constitutive terms. The third term will be different from his first two as he was the prime minister backed by an absolute majority for his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, in the last two terms. This time, Modi has to rely on coalition partners under the banner of the National Democratic Alliance.With Modi entering his third term, will Nepal-India ties change, or will they remain the same? Modi has championed the “Neighborhood First” policy in his dealings with South Asian nations. Modi is the only Indian prime minister who has visited Nepal more than once—in 2014 and 2018, and again in 2022.

There is very much consistency in their policy towards Nepal,” said former foreign minister Ramesh Nath Pandey. “Modi will have control over Nepal policy.In the past decade, several Nepali prime ministers have visited India and interacted with Modi. The Indian prime minister is thus fully aware of Nepal’s concerns and interests, as well as India's expectations of Nepal. However, according to Pandey, Nepal has squandered a decade trying to shed the historical baggage and resolve bilateral differences.This time, the BJP’s coalition partner, the Janata Dal (United), hails from the bordering state of Bihar. The JDU has called for a review of India’s controversial Agnipath scheme, under which hundreds of Nepali youths used to be recruited into the Indian Army’s Gorkha regiments. The Nepal government has refused to allow India to recruit its youth under this short-term scheme, arguing that the 1947 agreement between Nepal, India and Britain stipulated full-term service in both the Indian and British Armies, not short-term enlistment.“Prime Minister Modi had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Nepal,” said an Indian government statement on Thursday.

But Modi’s new term is full of challenges as he will have to rely on and persuade his alliance partners and this could lead to instability in governance.Ranjit Rae, former Indian ambassador to Nepal, said that India’s foreign policy will remain unchanged in Modi’s third term as there is broad consensus among the parties on key foreign policy issues. “As Nitish Kumar is in the government and Bihar shares a long border with Nepal, Nepal will remain important in the foreign policy architecture,” Rae said. “Primarily, India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy will continue.” On reviewing the Agnipath scheme, Rae said that it would be good if the new government reviewed it. According to the Indian media, there are hard bargains among coalition partners in New Delhi on power-sharing and it remains to be decided which party gets what portfolio.The two key alliance partners, N Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party and Nitish Kumar, both have secular credentials, so a party-centric foreign policy is unlikely to dominate during Modi’s third term, said Nihar Nayak, Research Fellow at the New Delhi-based Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA).According to Nayak, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) could see a revival, and as per the strong demands of Nitish Kumar’s JDU, the Agnipath scheme will also be scrapped.“If the Agnipath scheme is scrapped or reviewed, relations with Nepal will improve. The second thing is that there will be no BJP foreign policy. India’s insecurity in the region will diminish. The call for the restoration of the Hindu state in Nepal is unlikely to crop up as prominently.

Even Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah has joined the chorus accusing Oli, who is also the UML chairman, of illegally swapping tea estate land, citing it as a clear case of policy corruption.The criticism from different quarters has put the UML on the defensive. And Oli is unable to hide his annoyance as questions come from all directions. His party is now defending the decision saying that the land swap was based on an amendment to the Land Act effected through a unanimous decision of the federal parliament.“No party opposed the Act’s amendment. The Nepali Congress also did not register any revision to the [amendment] bill.

Cabinet decisions are deemed to be among such decisions. Even though the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority Act-1991 is silent on what constitutes a policy decision, the Supreme Court in 1996 sought to define it.As per the 1996 verdict issued by then-chief justice Surendra Prasad Singh and justices Keshav Prasad Upadhyaya, Laxman Prasad Aryal, Kedar Nath Upadhyay and Udayaraj Upadhyaya, decisions taken ‘collectively’ by the Cabinet to fulfil promises made in the election manifesto constitute ‘policy decisions’.Nepali politicians have long been spared from prosecution as decisions made in the Cabinet are termed policy decisions. The anti-graft body has directed the government and Parliament to define what constitutes a ‘policy decision’. Anti-corruption activists have also been seeking clarity on the concept for the same reason.The Oli government presented a bill to amend the Land Act in 2019. It was endorsed by both houses of the federal parliament in January 2020. Based on the new law, the Oli government on April 26, 2021 allowed the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate owners to swap 343.19 bighas (1 bigha equals 6,773 square metres) of land occupied by the tea estate. The decision was challenged in the Supreme Court. A constitutional bench of the court revoked the decision ruling it illegal.The opposition started lashing out at Oli and his party after the court verdict and its full text. This was not the first time that Parliament passed the bill unanimously and realised later that the executive had mala fide intent. On December 24, 2018, the government registered a bill in the federal parliament to amend a few laws. It included a proposal to revise the Nepal Trust Act. The bill revising 56 different laws was tabled for deliberations in the House of Representatives on January 1, 2019 and it was endorsed on February 15 unopposed. The National Assembly endorsed it on March 2 that year, before President Bidya Devi Bhandari authenticated it the very next day. However, the issue came to light only when the Oli government decided to lease out the land under the trust to the Yeti Group.

It must be discussed widely in the House to make sure that it serves a right cause,” said advocate Mohan Acharya. Amid widespread criticism that law-making lacks broad participation, a bill is under consideration in the House to ensure that legislation becomes a more consultative process.“The bill, if passed, will ensure that bills are drafted after proper consultations with all stakeholders. They will be widely discussed before endorsement,” said Devkota. “In federal countries, central governments discuss bills with the provinces before tabling them in Parliament. Had this been done, there would not have been scams like Giri Bandhu.”Besides, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government is creating a mechanism for turning legislation into a more consultative process.

In today’s time, when power has ceased to be a zero-sum game and good leadership is synonymous with collaboration, the traditionally inclined old men clumsily spewing patriarchal narratives make civilised citizens extremely uncomfortable. Political women with independent political personhood have always been problematic to traditional men. Sahana’s grit, Shailaja’s impatience, Binda’s blatant feminism and Sumana’s formidability seem to have threatened those with the traditional bent of mind. At least two generations of strong, opinionated women have been sidelined or ousted because they did not fit into the mould of patriarchal party politics. It almost seems like the traditional men view them as political “shrews” who, like in the famous Shakespearean play The Taming of the Shrew, need to be “tamed”, cut to a size that is desirable to political patriarchy.Until not long ago, the concept of a “good woman” stemmed from feminine subservience and obedience. Women’s personhood was stunted through intense psychological conditioning that can be traced back to the origins of the state and society. A woman was told how her family’s honour rested on her good character. She was introduced to a heavy burden of feminine morality at an early age. With stories being fed about good women versus bad, patriarchy was very successful in grooming girls to grow up to be good women and obedient keepers of their family’s honour. Subservience was the prerequisite to being a good woman. A good woman was anything but defiant, and if by chance she did get tempted to disobey and defy the norms, she paid a hefty price. This “truth” was continuously fed into the feminine psyche, mostly through religious texts and scriptures. These women were duly punished in the ancient scriptures and medieval texts crafted and propagated by men.Vyaas wrote the story of how Draupadi was dragged by her hair and abused publicly because she had made fun of Duryodhana, leading to the great war between the Pandava and Kaurava brothers. Mother Mary was glorified as a virgin, while Mary Magdalene was vilified as a “loose” woman and had to be rescued. Sita’s disobedience tempted Ravana and caused much grief to Lord Ram. Eve disobeyed the Lord and ate the apple only to be the cause of Adam’s banishment. Khadija was a strong woman and a successful merchant before she married the Prophet, but she submitted herself to him and became his first disciple. In addition, the annual celebration of Swasthani Vrata Katha revered the ideal woman in the form of Goma Brahmani, who never protested, tolerated every injustice inflicted against her personhood. The idea of feminine morality has been strongly correlated with women’s socio-cultural subservience, religious conformity, psychological and economic fragility and physical docility. Even in politics, the men in charge prefer women who embody traditional femininity. However, here lies the problem: The idea of moral, subservient women clashes with the essence of equality and freedom propounded by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Women who have learned the freedoms cannot unlearn them. Today, several women in politics are highly qualified, independent, articulate and honest. They live the most painful existence because the unlearning of patriarchal values has already taken place within them, and they have a fully developed sense of personhood, which, however, is repeatedly obliterated by their party men or other political men who still operate by the patriarchal rules. Strong, independent, ethical women are repeatedly denied space in the party’s leadership. Educated, dignified, honest, resolute, independent and opinionated, Shailja Acharya was often ridiculed for her “short temper” and “moods”. In UML’s case, Sahana’s leadership in the inter-party women’s caucus irked her party men. An economist by training, she was more qualified than most men in her party, but her commitment to the larger political sorority was perceived as defiance; therefore, a covert “cutting to size” was practised against her as well. Narratives are created to invalidate women as viable leaders. These days, the “tamings” have become more overt. Binda Pandey, one of the handful of qualified women inside UML, was denied an election ticket, and the insider quickly pointed out that her “attitude” killed her prospects. The same has been the case with Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe, Kamala Panta, Shashi Shrestha, and others. Women’s recruitment, retention and promotions in parties seek obedient, subservient “yes-women” who do not have to be “tamed”. The latest “taming” attempt, however, appears much more menacing than the past. A woman with an ivy-league education, who speaks the global language, wears gender-neutral clothing, questions the old guards about procedural gaps, carries her own bags, drives her own car and has managed to keep herself out of the clout-centric politics so far, must irk the political retainers quite intensely to receive such blatant, overt attacks regarding her personal choices: From her clothing to her life partner. KP Oli has tried dismantling Sumana Shrestha’s political legitimacy and citizenship by calling Nepal her maita. The chauvinism that drips from Oli’s statement is disgustingly archaic, feudal and regressive for a leader of his stature.Bringing Shrestha into the helm of political give-and-take does not seem to have worked; if it had, Oli would not have had to start “taming” her. If she was unapologetically vocal as a member of the opposition, she seems adamant as a minister to fix the portfolio given to her. Maybe it is her “audacity” to fix the system at the ministry that has somehow miffed the old guard like Oli. His recent rants, aimed to paint her as a frivolous, westernised young woman whose political journey is a mere fluke, scream his intense insecurities. If that is indeed the case, then maybe Sumana Shrestha is doing something right, and we need more “shrew” muckrakers like her.  ","summary":"The collective indignity bestowed on political women, from Shailaja Acharya to Sumana Shrestha, by political patriarchs needs immediate redress.

This “truth” was continuously fed into the feminine psyche, mostly through religious texts and scriptures. These women were duly punished in the ancient scriptures and medieval texts crafted and propagated by men.Vyaas wrote the story of how Draupadi was dragged by her hair and abused publicly because she had made fun of Duryodhana, leading to the great war between the Pandava and Kaurava brothers. Mother Mary was glorified as a virgin, while Mary Magdalene was vilified as a “loose” woman and had to be rescued. Sita’s disobedience tempted Ravana and caused much grief to Lord Ram. Eve disobeyed the Lord and ate the apple only to be the cause of Adam’s banishment. Khadija was a strong woman and a successful merchant before she married the Prophet, but she submitted herself to him and became his first disciple. In addition, the annual celebration of Swasthani Vrata Katha revered the ideal woman in the form of Goma Brahmani, who never protested, tolerated every injustice inflicted against her personhood. The idea of feminine morality has been strongly correlated with women’s socio-cultural subservience, religious conformity, psychological and economic fragility and physical docility. Even in politics, the men in charge prefer women who embody traditional femininity. However, here lies the problem: The idea of moral, subservient women clashes with the essence of equality and freedom propounded by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Women who have learned the freedoms cannot unlearn them. Today, several women in politics are highly qualified, independent, articulate and honest. They live the most painful existence because the unlearning of patriarchal values has already taken place within them, and they have a fully developed sense of personhood, which, however, is repeatedly obliterated by their party men or other political men who still operate by the patriarchal rules. Strong, independent, ethical women are repeatedly denied space in the party’s leadership. Educated, dignified, honest, resolute, independent and opinionated, Shailja Acharya was often ridiculed for her “short temper” and “moods”. In UML’s case, Sahana’s leadership in the inter-party women’s caucus irked her party men. An economist by training, she was more qualified than most men in her party, but her commitment to the larger political sorority was perceived as defiance; therefore, a covert “cutting to size” was practised against her as well. Narratives are created to invalidate women as viable leaders. These days, the “tamings” have become more overt. Binda Pandey, one of the handful of qualified women inside UML, was denied an election ticket, and the insider quickly pointed out that her “attitude” killed her prospects. The same has been the case with Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe, Kamala Panta, Shashi Shrestha, and others. Women’s recruitment, retention and promotions in parties seek obedient, subservient “yes-women” who do not have to be “tamed”. The latest “taming” attempt, however, appears much more menacing than the past. A woman with an ivy-league education, who speaks the global language, wears gender-neutral clothing, questions the old guards about procedural gaps, carries her own bags, drives her own car and has managed to keep herself out of the clout-centric politics so far, must irk the political retainers quite intensely to receive such blatant, overt attacks regarding her personal choices: From her clothing to her life partner. KP Oli has tried dismantling Sumana Shrestha’s political legitimacy and citizenship by calling Nepal her maita. The chauvinism that drips from Oli’s statement is disgustingly archaic, feudal and regressive for a leader of his stature.Bringing Shrestha into the helm of political give-and-take does not seem to have worked; if it had, Oli would not have had to start “taming” her. If she was unapologetically vocal as a member of the opposition, she seems adamant as a minister to fix the portfolio given to her. Maybe it is her “audacity” to fix the system at the ministry that has somehow miffed the old guard like Oli. His recent rants, aimed to paint her as a frivolous, westernised young woman whose political journey is a mere fluke, scream his intense insecurities. If that is indeed the case, then maybe Sumana Shrestha is doing something right, and we need more “shrew” muckrakers like her.  "},{"hash":"8564b8efd916fdf8320b659c6a6b6f27bca75cea72b9dd86e985dcb0f54e8c06","title":"after-3-years-nepal-dusts-off-plan-to-launch-5g","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/06/09/after-3-years-nepal-dusts-off-plan-to-launch-5g","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2019/third-party/Untitled1-1717898465.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1717891200000,"source":"kp","category":"money","content":"After three years of halt, the much-awaited 5G frequency is set to be auctioned in Nepal.“The telecom regulator is ready to allow 5G frequency, and we are waiting for service providers’ response,” said Pradip Paudyal, deputy director of Nepal Telecommunications Authority.Paudyal, however, didn’t mention the auction date.“We have decided to auction the 5G frequency and are preparing for it,” he said.Paudyal said that to take part in the auction, service providers should clear all the dues they owe to the government.5G, or fifth-generation mobile technology, offers 10 times faster internet speed than its predecessor 4G and supports 10 times more devices per square kilometre.The state-owned phone company has announced several launch dates, but they have always been postponed for no apparent reason.The 5G rollout was originally planned in 2021 but came to an abrupt halt, which insiders said was due to geopolitics.American and Indian embassies’ officials recently told the Post that they were concerned about the Nepal government allowing the Chinese companies to conduct the 5G tests without going through a competitive bidding process.Nepal Telecom has also been saying that there aren’t enough 5G compatible phones in Kathmandu and other cities to warrant launching the new technology. But records show that millions of mobile phones with advanced features have been imported in the past two years.The rollout plan has been revived after the formation of the new government, which, according to insiders, is close to its northern neighbour, China, which has installed and supplied 5G equipment.“We introduced the new frequency policy around four months ago. Under this policy, all frequencies will go into technology neutrality from the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25,” said Paudyal. Technology neutrality allows service providers to use any technology in a given frequency, he said.Currently, there are two telecom service providers operating in the country—Telecom and Ncell.According to the telecom regulator, service providers can introduce 5G technology using existing frequencies or new ones. The authority says it is prepared to provide new frequencies through auction. Nepal Telecom was provided with a 2,600 Mhz frequency for the 5G trial. The authority provided the frequency for a year, and Nepal Telecom conducted an internal trial for around 2-3 months last October. It was said that Nepal Telecom would conduct a trial among the public, but that wasn’t meant to be. The regulator has written to Nepal Telecom to submit a report on the 5G trial.“Once it receives the report, the authority will proceed accordingly,” Paudyal said.While the government said it is ready to introduce 5G technology, the service providers said that since building the 5G ecosystem requires huge investment and as the country’s current economic situation is not so good, the market is not ready for the new mobile technology.It is estimated that service providers need to invest around Rs50-60 billion to implement 5G technology. Both the market and consumers are not ready for the technology, and there are device constraints, too.According to service providers, though mobile phone users’ demands have been growing in Nepal, daily data usage remains very low. Only two out of 10 Nepalis use mobile data regularly, according to Ncell, the private telecom provider.Ncell said in a recent statement that the average monthly data consumption per customer is only 4GB, which is low compared to other neighbouring countries.The telecom service providers are losing money and have outstanding dues due to the reduction in income.When Ncell introduced 4G in 2017, its annual income was Rs58-59 billion, which has now declined to Rs33-35 billion.Similarly, Nepal Telecom’s profit declined to Rs7.8 billion in the last fiscal year from Rs15.01 billion in 2017. According to a report by Cable.co.uk, the mobile data price measured from June to September 2023 is $0.43, or Rs57.38. The average cost of 1GB of data in India is $0.16, $0.12 in Pakistan, $0.23 in Bangladesh, $0.25 in Sri Lanka, $0.71 in Bhutan, and $2.16 in the Maldives. Mobile data prices are expensive in Nepal compared to other South Asian countries.Nepal Telecom concluded the 5G trial in four places in certain mobile sets to check whether the technology supports our network, said Hari Dhakal, spokesperson of Nepal Telecom.“As it requires a huge investment to bring the technology, we need to look at the cost, market readiness, return and other factors. So it will be difficult for us to go to the public immediately and we will not bring it unless we are assured of all the factors.”Jabbor Kayumov, CEO of Ncell, told a recent press meeting that after India, Ncell was looking to make Nepal the first country in South Asia to introduce 5G commercially. “But to get there, we need to take an important first step, and that is we need every Nepali to start using their mobile phones productively which means keeping mobile data always on.”Also, the government needs to create favourable conditions and reform laws to bring the new technology, company insiders say.For instance, a case involving Nepal Telecom and Ncell is under the court’s consideration. The government is forcefully asking telecom service providers to clear the frequency amount before the auction of 2,100 Mhz by bringing retrospective law, insiders say.3G was introduced in Nepal in 2007 and 4G in 2017.After the government announced an ‘economic decade’, digital economy topics are coming to the fore. “For a digital economy, digital transformation is necessary, which in turn calls for 5G technology. This is why the government has prioritised 5G,” Paudyal said. According to the 61st annual report of the Auditor General, Nepal Telecom spent Rs18.43 million for the trial of 5G in the current fiscal year. The audit has suggested that the company needs to be more effective in the implementation of 5G technology.

He sculpts his identity through his furious consumption of a carefully curated collection of philosophy books. On any given day, Mukti might be an existentialist, a cynic, a nihilist, or an anarchist—whichever ideology fits his mood and serves his whims. Though ostensibly influenced by Camus’s Meursault, Mukti, the Kathmandu absurdist, resembles JD Salinger’s Holden Caulfield. Like Caulfield, Mukti harbours a pervasive disdain for life and exhibits a passionate, erratic, and seemingly senseless animosity towards everyone around him.His intense seriousness coupled with his apathetic detachment, often exasperating, and deeply ridiculous, depicts the essence of youth striving—or pretending—to differentiate themselves from the common run, something I found to be very much reminiscent of Holden Caulfield in ‘Catcher in the Rye’. Mukti's journey in the novel is a satirical exploration of the quest for meaning in a city that often feels senseless and absurd. To him, seeking meaning is a futility one must not be bored of or bothered with. Set in Kathmandu, where more gods reside than people, Mukti is overwhelmed by a persistent sense of dread. In stark contrast to his realist friend and lover, Maya, Mukti sees problems everywhere and spends his leisure time debating the futility of it all. He is consumed by a “dark warmth,” an inner void that convinces him of life’s utter pointlessness. He also develops a deep disdain towards god. Adopting Nietzsche's proclamation, \"God is dead,\" Mukti wrestles with his religious quandaries and the rituals that accompany them.This book is also intermittently set in a fantastical realm of world history, where Sisyphus encounters many popular philosophical figures such as King Suddodhan, warrior Ashwattama, Emperor Marcus Aurelius, and the beloved Friedrich Nietzsche. This philosophical crossover weaves together diverse perspectives on the human condition and the eternal quest for understanding—showing the reader how the plight of meaning and depths of meaninglessness have tormented the human race since its manifestation. In the myth of Sisyphus, it is said that Sisyphus was a trickster king who deceived the gods on multiple occasions. As a punishment, Zeus sentences him to roll a boulder to the top of a mountain, only for it to roll back down every time he reaches the summit, forcing him to begin again. In Albert Camus's novel of the same name, ‘The Myth of Sisyphus’, Camus compares Sisyphus’s eternal task with the human condition, discussing how human life is also bound by such repetitions. Each time Sisyphus reaches the top, the boulder rolls back down, symbolising the perpetual cycle of starting over that characterises human existence.In Saurav Thapa’s imagination, Sisyphus is tasked with a boulder of a different nature. Zeus has tasked Sisyphus with removing the \"Dark Warmth\" from individuals who suffer deeply from it. However, this task proves to be endless, much like his initial boulder. Throughout human history, countless individuals have experienced and will continue to experience the void of nothingness and the thorns of apathy.This absurdism lies at the core of human existence—the loss of meaning in a world that often seems to overflow with it.Mukti's outlook changes dramatically when he meets Sanumaya Tamang, a village girl who has been raped by her master and subsequently denied justice. Frustrated by the gaps in the system, Mukti resigns from his office, which causes his parents deep distress.At this point, the novel mirrors the premise of Dostoevsky’s ‘Crime and Punishment’. Much like the pathetic and passionate Raskolnikov, Mukti strives towards justice, promising to get revenge on Sanumaya’s behalf by murdering her master. However, unlike Raskolnikov's successful orchestration of murder in the novel, Mukti's attempt fails because of his cowardice. He is all tell, and no show, and this is evident throughout the book.Every day ennui gets the best of Mukti, and his boredom corrupts him. As the book progresses, Mukti’s narcissistic passions for a futile end endanger the safety of his friends. The book subtly yet intelligently addresses the topic of class and social standing. Mukti's privileged position allows him the luxury of philosophising, acting erratically, and committing various crimes, knowing that his powerful father can shield him from the consequences. However, as Mukti indulges in his recklessness, he endangers innocent people and bears the brunt of his actions.His lack of guilt and apathy toward his actions are reminiscent of Albert Camus’s protagonist, Mersault in ‘The Stranger.’ He is relentlessly analytical, over-intellectualising his surroundings and opinions. Mukti relies on hermeneutics and excessively expresses disdain for patriotism and religion.His relationship with Maya also seems to be somewhat inspired by Jean-Paul Sartre’s protagonist in \"Nausea,\" Antoine, and his lover Anny. Maya stands in stark contrast to Mukti, opposing him in every way, though she tolerates his philosophising. His endless cynicism often wears her down. Their relationship ends, and contrary to popular belief, opposites might attract, but they do not last. In the end, Mukti seems to find mukti (freedom) after conversing with Sisyphus, discreetly disguised as a Pashupati sadhu. His fate mirrors that of both Meursault and Raskolnikov. The ecstasy of surrendering for his crimes grants him the ultimate meaning of life: to suffer for the suffering he caused. Though not entirely original, this novel is an engaging read with many amusing and witty moments. It offers a clever critique of the caste system, class, social injustice, and Kathmandu—exploring the tendency of Nepalis to cling to their history due to a lack of recent glories. This book provides a thorough analysis of Nepalis and Kathmandu society as a whole. However, some readers may find the lengthy philosophical passages and excessive thought exercises tedious. The language is rigorous, perhaps not too orderly when it ventures into landscapes of wildness, disruption and revolt. The author also relies heavily on adjectives and jargon to propel the story, which could be distracting for more seasoned readers. However, I will say that I also found the integration of Nepali words and cuss words witty and delightful, a unique stylistic choice in the novel. It was a great experience to read something intellectual yet close to home.Admittedly, this book targets a niche audience. It may be frustrating for readers without a background in philosophy to get through the book, as it is highly referential and heavily depends on the reader's familiarity with popular philosophical figures. Despite this, it is an entertaining novel for readers aiming to broaden their repertoire. The novel scrupulously weaves together elements of philosophy, satire, and social commentary, inviting readers to contemplate the eternal human quest for understanding. Mukti’s journey in the novel reflects the common persistence of meaninglessness in our lives and is an interesting case study of the extent to which people go for ideology.

Mukti relies on hermeneutics and excessively expresses disdain for patriotism and religion.His relationship with Maya also seems to be somewhat inspired by Jean-Paul Sartre’s protagonist in \"Nausea,\" Antoine, and his lover Anny. Maya stands in stark contrast to Mukti, opposing him in every way, though she tolerates his philosophising. His endless cynicism often wears her down. Their relationship ends, and contrary to popular belief, opposites might attract, but they do not last. In the end, Mukti seems to find mukti (freedom) after conversing with Sisyphus, discreetly disguised as a Pashupati sadhu. His fate mirrors that of both Meursault and Raskolnikov. The ecstasy of surrendering for his crimes grants him the ultimate meaning of life: to suffer for the suffering he caused. Though not entirely original, this novel is an engaging read with many amusing and witty moments. It offers a clever critique of the caste system, class, social injustice, and Kathmandu—exploring the tendency of Nepalis to cling to their history due to a lack of recent glories. This book provides a thorough analysis of Nepalis and Kathmandu society as a whole. However, some readers may find the lengthy philosophical passages and excessive thought exercises tedious. The language is rigorous, perhaps not too orderly when it ventures into landscapes of wildness, disruption and revolt. The author also relies heavily on adjectives and jargon to propel the story, which could be distracting for more seasoned readers. However, I will say that I also found the integration of Nepali words and cuss words witty and delightful, a unique stylistic choice in the novel. It was a great experience to read something intellectual yet close to home.Admittedly, this book targets a niche audience. It may be frustrating for readers without a background in philosophy to get through the book, as it is highly referential and heavily depends on the reader's familiarity with popular philosophical figures. Despite this, it is an entertaining novel for readers aiming to broaden their repertoire. The novel scrupulously weaves together elements of philosophy, satire, and social commentary, inviting readers to contemplate the eternal human quest for understanding. Mukti’s journey in the novel reflects the common persistence of meaninglessness in our lives and is an interesting case study of the extent to which people go for ideology.

Officials said they started fixing potholes, concreting and other works on Wednesday.“We have allocated Rs30 million for the repairs, and the work started on Wednesday after completing the tender process,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC). “We have asked the contractor to complete the work at the earliest in view of the looming monsoon.”Every year, garbage disposal is affected during the monsoon season due to rain, landslides, and poor road conditions. Sometimes, garbage disposal is disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions result in a complete halt in door-to-door garbage collection for weeks, leading locals in the Valley to discard their trash on the streets and causing chaos in the city.“We are aware of the risks associated with obstructions in garbage disposal and their consequences,” said Shrestha. “We have been taking measures accordingly to lessen all possible risks.”The metropolis said that around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised.Meteorologists in Nepal anticipate the onset of monsoon by the end of next week, a few days ahead of the usual June 13 arrival of the weather system from the Bay of Bengal.KMC is also considering purchasing a high-pressure pump to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground. Recently, locals in the Sisdole area protested and stopped the trucks from disposing of garbage alleging the KMC’s negligence in leachate control.Municipal officials said that the Ministry of Urban Development took away a high-pressure pumpset from the landfill site's leachate pond some three months ago for maintenance, but has yet to return it. Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The city office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled.

However, the growth rate of cheque presentation experienced a 5 percent decline (from 21 percent to 16 percent) over the past year.In countries like Bhutan and Nepal, challenging terrain, difficult topography, and scattered populations complicate the provision of consistent infrastructure, particularly in rural and remote areas where poor internet and service disruptions degrade digital payment services, the study showed.Insiders say Nepal's digital payment race started quite late, and cash transactions still outweigh digital transactions. The country lags in digital infrastructure, as the National Payment Switch is still a work in progress, and retail payment and real-time gross payment were introduced in 2019. This shows that digital payment infrastructure was a late development in Nepal, pushing back digital payment adoption. There has been a significant increase in mobile banking and quick response (QR) code-based transactions in the country in recent times. However, important factors like financial and digital literacy, uninterrupted internet connection, and people's adaptability are still lacking in the country, said Gunakar Bhatta, executive director of Nepal Rastra Bank. Also, there are areas where the security system needs strengthening. As consumers prefer digital payments, the dependency on paper-based payment instruments has declined by 64 percent in Bhutan, 40 percent in India, 34 percent in Sri Lanka, 16 percent in Pakistan and 5 percent in Bangladesh.In the context of Nepal, the constraints in the adoption of digital payment are many.Through the Digital Nepal Framework, the country aims to address low digital literacy, which is a challenge to technology-based economic growth.According to the report, 46 percent of Nepal's population is unbanked. Of those without access to banks, 25.05 percent are women and 20.95 percent men. The national financial literacy rate is 57.9 percent, with a gender gap favouring men.A Nepal Rastra Bank report shows that Nepal’s payment service providers are grappling with a shortage of policies, insufficient physical infrastructure, subpar corporate governance, and a lack of proper strategy for sustained business operations during crises. Most e-wallet service providers are making losses and are unable to invest in infrastructure.Nepal has a high mobile internet penetration rate of 98.46 percent (2022), against 140.07 percent mobile penetration in the South Asia region. However, this does not imply universal access to mobile phones and the internet across the region, as individuals may own multiple devices or connections, the report said. For instance, not everyone in Nepal with a smartphone has an internet connection. Despite high connectivity indicators, there remain significant disparities within countries regarding access to digital services, influenced by rural-urban divides, gender gaps, and geographical challenges.The report showed a huge gap in smartphone and internet access between rural and urban Nepalis.In Nepal, 52.55 percent of urban households have smartphones, while 20.45 percent of rural households have access to them. In urban households, 30.9 percent have access to the internet while only 6.96 percent of rural households have an internet connection.Payment innovations in digital financial services are said to be reshaping consumer behaviour and serving as an important tool for financial inclusion, notably through direct-to-beneficiary transfers across South Asia. These innovations facilitate easier beneficiary identification, reduce intermediary involvement in government disbursement, and improve efficiency.In Nepal, almost 90 percent of government expense transactions, including government-to-person payments such as salaries, pensions, and social security, are now digital, with about 30 percent of government revenue collected via digital platforms like mobile applications, online gateways, mobile wallets, or web applications, the report said.Although digital payment innovations have proved instrumental in furthering financial inclusion, the growth in digital payments has also introduced new risks, including fraud, money laundering, cyber threats, and data breaches. Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting digital payment platforms, leading to data breaches and unauthorised transactions such as Hundi. This poses significant challenges to the safety and trust of the digital payment ecosystem in the region, the report said. ","summary":"While most other South Asian countries have switched to digital money, a report shows that Nepal's use of paper-based payment instruments has increased by 37 percent in the last five years.According to Payment Innovations and Risks in South Asia published by the South Asian Region Financial Inclusion Initiative and a member of its Task Force, paper-based payment instruments like cheques and demand drafts increased in value to $13.92 million in 2022 from $10.12 million in 2018. However, the growth rate of cheque presentation experienced a 5 percent decline (from 21 percent to 16 percent) over the past year.In countries like Bhutan and Nepal, challenging terrain, difficult topography, and scattered populations complicate the provision of consistent infrastructure, particularly in rural and remote areas where poor internet and service disruptions degrade digital payment services, the study showed.Insiders say Nepal's digital payment race started quite late, and cash transactions still outweigh digital transactions. The country lags in digital infrastructure, as the National Payment Switch is still a work in progress, and retail payment and real-time gross payment were introduced in 2019. This shows that digital payment infrastructure was a late development in Nepal, pushing back digital payment adoption. There has been a significant increase in mobile banking and quick response (QR) code-based transactions in the country in recent times. However, important factors like financial and digital literacy, uninterrupted internet connection, and people's adaptability are still lacking in the country, said Gunakar Bhatta, executive director of Nepal Rastra Bank. Also, there are areas where the security system needs strengthening.

However, most districts in the country have already reported outbreaks of the deadly disease even before the onset of monsoon.Public health experts have warned of a massive outbreak of the potentially deadly virus in the coming days, as the monsoon is just around the corner, and authorities are not doing much to prevent outbreaks.“Except counting the number of infected people and releasing statements, not much of substance is being done,” said Dr Baburam Gautam, a public health expert. “The general public has stopped taking such statements on dengue infection seriously.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,105 people from 69 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 69 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 112. Jhapa district recorded 109 cases, followed by Chitwan (73), Makwanpur (58), Sindhupalchok (44), Tanahun (39), Okhaldhunga (38), Doti (30), Rupandehi (28), and Bhaktapur (27). The three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur—together reported 157 cases of infections in this period.Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa, and Kalikot are among the mountain districts that have reported dengue cases.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Post-monsoon is considered a highly transmissible season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease around the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Experts say this is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks.Waiting for a massive outbreak would be a big mistake, they say. To reduce the risk, authorities should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance, and take other measures. Health ministry officials said that they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.“Even if massive outbreaks have not been seen in any place, many districts have already reported dengue cases,” said Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “We have alerted all relevant agencies to the risk of an outbreak in the coming days.”Authorities and agencies in some local units have launched activities to raise residents' awareness of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, Dahal said.Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities do not take it seriously. They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients having these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.

On Tuesday, Dhangadhi recorded 40.4 degrees Celsius, Nepalgunj 40.2 degrees Celsius and Birendranagar 37.3 degrees Celsius, the Met office’s data shows.Met officials anticipate monsoon will start at the end of next week and bring respite from scorching heat.Over 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 are being inoculated with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in a nationwide immunisation drive started on May 26.Officials said that children who missed the IPV vaccine during the routine immunisation programme will be administered the vaccine, as they are at risk of getting infected with Type-2 polio.Gautam said that vaccination programmes are being carried out smoothly in the rest of the places. The vaccine is being administered in schools, booths and health posts.Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but the World Health Organisation officially declared it polio-free on March 27, 2014 after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV).The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus.The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus.However, the Type -2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in the South Asia region to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN Health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Gautam said that due to global shortages of the IPV vaccine, children born between April 13, 2016, and October 18, 2018 were inoculated only with the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine.“Children who missed the IPV vaccine will be at high risk of poliovirus infection,” Gautam said. “So we are launching a campaign to inoculate them.”Health officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.Childhood immunisation is the number one priority of the government, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, however, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all.This figure was one percent in 2016.The Ministry of Health and Population said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country. ","summary":"Severe heat in the Tarai region has affected ongoing polio vaccination programmes.Officials at the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services say the immunisation campaign has been affected by school closures due to scorching heat.“The immunisation campaign will resume once schools resume their regular classes,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section. “It will take more time for the campaign to complete due to the severe heat in Tarai districts.”Several districts’ maximum temperatures have either reached close to or crossed 40 degrees Celsius in the last few days. On Tuesday, Dhangadhi recorded 40.4 degrees Celsius, Nepalgunj 40.2 degrees Celsius and Birendranagar 37.3 degrees Celsius, the Met office’s data shows.Met officials anticipate monsoon will start at the end of next week and bring respite from scorching heat.Over 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 are being inoculated with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in a nationwide immunisation drive started on May 26.Officials said that children who missed the IPV vaccine during the routine immunisation programme will be administered the vaccine, as they are at risk of getting infected with Type-2 polio.Gautam said that vaccination programmes are being carried out smoothly in the rest of the places. The vaccine is being administered in schools, booths and health posts.Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but the World Health Organisation officially declared it polio-free on March 27, 2014 after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV).The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus.The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus.However, the Type -2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in the South Asia region to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN Health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Gautam said that due to global shortages of the IPV vaccine, children born between April 13, 2016, and October 18, 2018 were inoculated only with the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine.“Children who missed the IPV vaccine will be at high risk of poliovirus infection,” Gautam said. “So we are launching a campaign to inoculate them.”Health officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.Childhood immunisation is the number one priority of the government, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate.

It requires a lot of investments and micro planning, which are currently lacking.”A recent report by the Ministry of Finance shows that 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births, the same results shown by the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030.

Most health facilities having birthing centres lack neonatal units, trained human resources, and quality services.“Without ensuring quality services, which require trained human resources and advanced facilities, among others, it is impossible to reduce neonatal deaths,” said Upreti. “The government has made various plans to reduce child deaths—including neonatal deaths—but does not pay much attention to their effective implementation.”The finance ministry’s recent report shows that the institutional delivery rate increased to 80 percent from 79 percent last year. The rise in institutional deliveries has contributed to lessening the maternal mortality rate, which is 151 in every 100,000 live births.“Fifty percent of the neonates die in the first 24 hours of birth,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services. “Most of our health facilities, including birthing centres, lack proper infrastructures.”Study shows that 85 percent of all deaths among children under the age of five in Nepal take place before a child’s first birthday, with 64 percent occurring during the first month of life.Along with trained human resources, infrastructures and quality services, deaths of neonates are also linked to the antenatal care visit of pregnant women, access to health facilities, timely referral system and others, experts say. The government has been taking various measures to reduce neonatal deaths, including planning to set up a ‘special newborn care unit’ in all district hospitals throughout the country. For that, concerned agencies under the health ministry have imparted training to all doctors, nurses and paramedics serving in Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok and Makawanpur district hospitals.Special newborn care units are general units designed to care for newborn children who fall ill shortly after birth. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics monitor ailing children admitted to the unit.The health ministry has installed an underfloor heating system at birthing centres in four mountain districts to curb postpartum and neonatal deaths there.Underfloor heating is a form of central heating that ensures indoor climate control for thermal comfort. It uses an electrical heating cable installed underneath the flooring.Hypothermia, infection, low birth weight, premature birth, and abnormal birth asphyxia are among the leading causes of neonatal deaths, doctors say.Some of the programmes being undertaken to lower child mortality include newborn care, kangaroo care, exclusive breastfeeding, infection prevention, chlorhexidine for umbilical cord care, and free neonatal care. “Whatever the achievements we made so far were achieved by the measures taken as of now,” said Upreti. “The ongoing programme may not achieve further progress.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease.

Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar.

They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood.

During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time.

So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time.

It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides.

Nepal, ranked 17th in the men’s T20I, are one of the top four highest-placed associated nations in the tournament. The young guns, led by 21-year-old captain Rohit Paudel, have the potential to cause an upset at the cricket tournament’s biggest stage and will aim to make history by progressing from the group stage.The top two teams from each of the four groups will reach the Super Eight stage. But their recent form—and a group including three full member nations and surprise elements the Netherlands—suggests that making it into the Super Eight will be difficult.Nepal will be making their first appearance at the World Cup since the World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014. They have never qualified for the 50-over Cricket World Cup and are the least experienced side in the group.They are heading into the World Cup following a series of disappointing results, including the ACC Men’s T20 Premier Cup debacle and a heavy 63-run warm-up defeat against Canada.Inconsistencies with the bat have been one of their biggest headaches so far.Openers Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh have failed to live up to the billing lately, resulting in a failure to give the team a good start. Three years ago, on April 17, 2021, when the duo fearlessly put on a record-breaking 116-run opening stand against the Netherlands in their T20I debut in Kirtipur during the Nepal Tri-Nation T20I Series, the impression was that Nepal had finally found the missing piece of their top batting order.However, questions have been raised over their form as the opening duo has failed to build any impressive partnership recently, especially this year.Bhurtel—despite being one of the three Nepali batters alongside Paudel and Dipendra Singh Airee to have crossed 1,000 T20I runs—is experiencing the worst year of his career and is showing no signs of improvement. In his last four T20I innings, he was dismissed for three ducks in a row during the Premier Cup, and for 10 runs against Canada during the World Cup warm-up. In between, he played knocks of 16, 2, 1 and 13 against West Indies A.Shiekh has also been unsteady with the bat. He scored a fifty against West Indies A and 22 against Canada in the World Cup warm-up but failed to cross double-digit figures in his previous four outings.Nepal’s batting display will heavily rely on skipper Paudel, who usually bats at number three, and big-hitter finisher Airee.Paudel is the most consistent batter in the Nepal squad. He is at his prime and entering the World Cup having scored 265 runs in his four innings that included a century and two half-centuries against West Indies A.Allrounder Airee holds the record for fastest T20I fifty. More recently, he entered the elite club when he smashed six sixes in an over against Qatar during the T20I Premier Cup, becoming the only third man to do so after Yuvraj Singh in 2007 and Keiron Pollard in 2021.Airee will certainly be the trump card of Nepal’s batting order at the World Cup.Kushal Malla, whose 34-ball hundred against Mongolia is the second fastest T20I century, is also expected to kindle fireworks.Nepal’s bowling unit will be another key strength at the World Cup, as they demonstrated in the warm-up game against Canada. They proved effective in the middle overs and struck five times in the space of 27 deliveries to limit Canada from 111-2 in the 14th over to 135-7 in the 18th over.All-rounder Sompal Kami—the only player from Nepal’s 2014 World Cup squad to feature in the 2024 edition—will bring hordes of experience in the bowling department and will lead the fast bowling alongside cult hero Karan KC, who is the highest wicket-taker in Nepal’s squad with 90 wickets from 68 innings.Lalit Rajbanshi will lead the spin threat alongside Sagar Dhakal, who is proving his worth by taking seven wickets in his last four matches.However, all eyes will be on Abinash Bohara, who will be crucial for Nepal at the back end of the innings as the majority of his wickets have come in the death overs. Since making his debut in 2019, Bohara has taken 74 wickets from 56 innings, which is the third highest for Nepal.Nepal will still be the heavy underdogs in the group, especially against 2014 world champions Sri Lanka and 2009 and 2014 semi-finalists South Africa. This will be the first time Nepal will face Sri Lanka and South Africa. Paudel, who is the youngest captain in the United States and the West Indies among the 20 participating nations, believes Nepal can do well at the World Cup. “I have faith in my team. They will give their best, be it in opening batting or other departments,” said Paudel, who added that the role of openers would be important. “It is upon the opening batters to get the team off to a good start,” he added.“In T20 cricket, no team is really a favourite. The Netherlands defeated Sri Lanka in the warm-up game. The United States beat Bangladesh twice for a historic 2-1 series victory. That’s why I believe we can and we will [compete].”If Nepal are to build momentum for the Super Eight stage, they will need to overcome their first hurdle against familiar foes Netherlands, who are making their fifth appearance at the T20 World Cup. But it will not be an easy task against the tricky Dutch, who are on the verge of completing a hat-trick of wins against the Proteas after defeating them in the 2022 T20 World Cup and the 2023 Cricket World Cup.“Our team is focused on the Netherlands match because it is very important for us to win that game and carry the thrust to the following matches. Our players are also well aware of their respective roles,” Paudel added.Nepal can also present a thrilling challenge to a Bangladesh team, who are reeling after hitting a new low after losing a series against inexperienced and tournament debutants, the US. The Tigers also lost to Zimbabwe by eight wickets in a T20I series earlier this month.This will be the second meeting between Nepal and Bangladesh. In fact, Bangladesh defeated Nepal by eight wickets in the group stage of the 2014 World Cup and progressed into the second round.

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  ","summary":"Gyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while.

Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  "},{"hash":"0991da860198933cb085873b5276ee12b69fdf5af60107bcea53aef9ffd2f489","title":"ai-spots-its-own-fakes","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/06/07/ai-spots-its-own-fakes","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/sideshutterstock2-1717768223.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1717718400000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"While fake news is not a new phenomenon, its proliferation today is unprecedented.

Officially launched in 2007 as an initiative of the Oxford-based International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications (INASP), NepJOL is now managed by the Central Library of Tribhuvan University. In its self-description, NepJOL is “a database of journals published in Nepal, covering the full range of academic disciplines.” Its primary objective “is to give greater visibility to the participating journals, and to the research they convey….by hosting their content online.” NepJOL now showcases over 400 Nepali journals. Many of these journals are dedicated to natural sciences, medical sciences, engineering and management. There is a sizable number of other journals which publish research in the social sciences and the humanities. Not all of these journals are “alive,” meaning new issues of some of them have not been published for years. However, they have not yet been declared “defunct” by their erstwhile editors. The portal provides general information about each journal. When new issues are uploaded, readers can read their table of contents and find the full texts of the published articles. In the case of many journals, the readers will also be able to access some or all of their back issues. As I have written elsewhere at great length, there are many reasons why the number of academic journals published from Nepal has increased massively since 1990. To put it briefly, the expansion of higher education across the country, especially the growth in the number of MA and above degree programmes in different Nepali universities, is an important factor fuelling this growth. The journals have become platforms to publish the research work of both graduate students and the faculty teaching them. In addition, this growth is also partially linked to the ways in which faculty performance is now evaluated in our universities. This growth also coincides with an increase in the professional differentiation of the middle class in Nepal. One of the ways in which academics all over the country have tried to mark their difference from literary writers and journalists is by publishing academic articles in journals with citations, footnotes and lists of references.Given this huge growth, it is very difficult to get hold of all the physical copies of the journals for keeping in institutional libraries. Subscription systems are mostly non-existent. Hence, it is a great service to researchers to be able to read full texts of new journal issues in NepJOL. In making such reading possible, NepJOL has definitely provided better visibility to the journals it hosts and better access to their contents. ContentsNepJOL states that journals are selected for inclusion in its portal if they meet the following first criterion: “They are scholarly in content, and contain original research.” When one goes through some issues of some of the social science and humanities journals now available in NepJOL, one would have to conclude that this criterion is also being applied rather liberally by the portal’s hosts and the editors of the participating journals. Without getting into the discussion about what might count as “scholarly” in content or “original” in research, it seems that as long as the journal contents are provided in the format of an academic output—articles with citations, footnotes and reference lists—they seem to qualify for uploading in NepJOL. Even more basically, once the journal passes the initial screening, anything that the journal editors provide will be uploaded. A good number of very readable research articles (and some great interviews) are found in the journals uploaded to NepJOL, and I recommend that you look them up and read the ones that interest you. However, in some issues of some journals, we find articles that might be best suited for publication in guidebooks (for example, pieces that discuss “how to do literature review” or “the APA style in research articles”). Quality controlled?Regarding the second criterion that journal contents should be “peer reviewed and quality controlled,” one would have to conclude that this criterion is also being applied rather liberally. Here too, it seems that anything supplied by the editors, once the journal has passed initial screening, will be uploaded. While I have not done the research to form a fully informed opinion on just what kinds of peer reviews are being done by participating journals in NepJOL, there is enough evidence in the uploaded contents to suggest that the quality of peer reviews being implemented varies a lot.For instance, I came across an article in the June 2023 issue of Baneshwor Campus Journal of Academia, where although two persons are named as authors, its text contains several sentences of the kind, “In this paper, I am going to portray the factors…” and “I am trying to introduce…” No explanation is provided in the text regarding this discrepancy. It should have been caught in the initial screening of the article by the journal’s editors and peer reviewers. Similarly, in the inaugural issue of Bagiswori Journal published in 2019, an article on think tanks in Nepal makes no reference to many relevant writings on the subject penned by other Nepali colleagues and myself. This lacuna, too, should have been caught in the peer review process.Let me be very clear. I am not saying that I hold the hosts of NepJOL responsible for these lapses in both the kinds of content being published and the poor peer screening that some of the published contents seem to have undergone during the pre-publication process. NepJOL is a database platform that hosts Nepali journals, and it cannot be faulted for the kind and quality of the contents being supplied under various journal titles. If I can use an analogy from the non-digital world, blaming NepJOL for the noted lapses would be the equivalent of blaming a physical bulletin board for the poor quality of notices put up on it!So, what is the point of this write-up, then? The first is that NepJOL has greatly increased access to Nepali journals and made their contents digitally available to readers for free. We (both Nepali and non-Nepali researchers of Nepali society) should read relevant content diligently to understand the complexities of Nepali history and society. We should also engage with such content in our own research by searching for it in the NepJOL portal. The second point to note is that the mere presence of a Nepali journal in NepJOL does not guarantee its quality and the quality of the peer review process that went into its making. Hence, universities should not treat journals in NepJOL as the platforms in which their students need to publish before or after entering MPhil or PhD programmes. Instead, they should encourage their students to publish in journals that execute a robust peer review process even if they are not hosted in NepJOL.

The ruling coalition has decided to elect Satish Singh of the Janamat Party to the position after Saroj Kumar Yadav of the Janata Samajwadi Party lost the vote of confidence following the withdrawal of support by the CPN (Unified Socialist). With this, Madhesh has joined the club of the provinces that have already had one or more government changes in the ongoing term. Now, only Bagmati province has not had any change of government since the provincial governments were formed in November 2022. While Madhesh is about to get a second government, Karnali has seen two, Lumbini and Sudurpaschim three each, Gandaki four, and Koshi six governments. Koshi also holds the distinct record of having a chief minister for the shortest period of 22 days. Sudurpaschim has also seen a chief minister for just a month while Gandaki has had a chief minister for 43 and 104 days respectively. In some cases, friends, family and cadres wouldn’t even have the opportunity to meet and congratulate the chief minister when he—it’s invariably a “he”, considering how even these temporary positions are usurped by the male top leaders of contemporary patriarchal political parties, except in the case of Asta Laxmi Shakya in the previous term in Bagmati—would have been thrown out of the government. Altogether, provinces have seen 21 government changes and 23 floor tests in the year and a half since the provincial elections. This is as pathetic as it gets. The very idea of adopting federalism was to ensure that the state's resources would be distributed evenly to all parts of the country. In theory, this was an excellent idea, one that would provide stable governments, leading to uninterrupted growth and development. But what we have got is quite the opposite. It is as if the devolution of power has been translated into devolution of self-serving interests, coalition politics and an utter disregard for people’s concerns. The lack of strong provincial parties means that the provincial governments are stable only as long as the political parties at the centre stick to their coalitions. Considering how the coalition government at the centre is carved out of a potpourri of political parties with a common greed for power, the political equations might change anytime. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has already taken a floor test four times in the current term of Parliament, and has vowed to take more such tests if necessary. With a history of changing associations at will, Dahal cannot be trusted to stick to a coalition. Therefore, the change of guard at the federal power centre in Kathmandu is an open possibility all the time. Such changes have had a cascading effect on provinces, with six provincial governments crumbling along with the federal government. The chain of instability that flows from the centre to the provinces must break at some point, and parties must sit together to come up with a common plan to ensure this. Otherwise, the people who fought hard to re-establish democracy and institute federalism will start looking for alternatives to these systems. If that happens, the biggest losers will be the big parties that helped usher in this system.  ","summary":"Madhesh Province is set to get a new chief minister. The ruling coalition has decided to elect Satish Singh of the Janamat Party to the position after Saroj Kumar Yadav of the Janata Samajwadi Party lost the vote of confidence following the withdrawal of support by the CPN (Unified Socialist). With this, Madhesh has joined the club of the provinces that have already had one or more government changes in the ongoing term. Now, only Bagmati province has not had any change of government since the provincial governments were formed in November 2022. While Madhesh is about to get a second government, Karnali has seen two, Lumbini and Sudurpaschim three each, Gandaki four, and Koshi six governments. Koshi also holds the distinct record of having a chief minister for the shortest period of 22 days. Sudurpaschim has also seen a chief minister for just a month while Gandaki has had a chief minister for 43 and 104 days respectively. In some cases, friends, family and cadres wouldn’t even have the opportunity to meet and congratulate the chief minister when he—it’s invariably a “he”, considering how even these temporary positions are usurped by the male top leaders of contemporary patriarchal political parties, except in the case of Asta Laxmi Shakya in the previous term in Bagmati—would have been thrown out of the government. Altogether, provinces have seen 21 government changes and 23 floor tests in the year and a half since the provincial elections. This is as pathetic as it gets. The very idea of adopting federalism was to ensure that the state's resources would be distributed evenly to all parts of the country. In theory, this was an excellent idea, one that would provide stable governments, leading to uninterrupted growth and development. But what we have got is quite the opposite. It is as if the devolution of power has been translated into devolution of self-serving interests, coalition politics and an utter disregard for people’s concerns. The lack of strong provincial parties means that the provincial governments are stable only as long as the political parties at the centre stick to their coalitions. Considering how the coalition government at the centre is carved out of a potpourri of political parties with a common greed for power, the political equations might change anytime. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has already taken a floor test four times in the current term of Parliament, and has vowed to take more such tests if necessary. With a history of changing associations at will, Dahal cannot be trusted to stick to a coalition. Therefore, the change of guard at the federal power centre in Kathmandu is an open possibility all the time. Such changes have had a cascading effect on provinces, with six provincial governments crumbling along with the federal government. The chain of instability that flows from the centre to the provinces must break at some point, and parties must sit together to come up with a common plan to ensure this. Otherwise, the people who fought hard to re-establish democracy and institute federalism will start looking for alternatives to these systems. If that happens, the biggest losers will be the big parties that helped usher in this system.  "},{"hash":"6c2dafd685acde737accf1c9d38d34f1b8c07bdc394e68f3c8a4d819f6f6e4b9","title":"india-s-course-correction","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/06/05/india-s-course-correction","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2019/third-party/modiandrahul-1717642196.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1717545600000,"source":"kp","category":"editorial","content":"The National Democratic Alliance, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, has clinched a victory for the third consecutive term in the Indian parliamentary elections, paving the way for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to continue his hold on power.

Modi also used the opportunity to list out what he called achievements of his 10-year stint as the prime minister—poverty alleviation, employment generation, economic growth, and so on. But his gait during the speech, and the spirit of the BJP leaders appearing on talk shows on television channels close to the BJP, suggested something was amiss. After months of pompously claiming that the NDA would cross the 400-seat mark in the 543-strong parliament, Modi was finally coming back to reality with a humble 293 seats, while the BJP’s own tally was 240, well below the 272 mark for a majority. Even more distressing for Modi was that the opposition alliance, INDIA, secured 230 seats, a feat even the opposition parties themselves had not expected considering the BJP’s hubris in the run-up to the elections. This was certainly a humbling moment for Modi. An important message the Indian electorate has given Modi, the BJP and the NDA is that there is only so much you can gain from the politics of religion. Coming on the heels of a massive campaign to “reinstate” Lord Ram in Ayodhya, the election was seen as a referendum on Modi’s Hindutva politics.

Another humbling prospect for Modi is having to share the stage with N Chandrababu Naidu of Andhra Pradesh and Nitish Kumar of Bihar. The fact that the opposition alliance is now strong enough to lure Naidu and Nitish into their camp—especially with Nitish earning the nickname “Paltu Babu” owing to his history of changing alliances—must have come as a hard truth for Modi, who has wielded a strong hand over governance during his two terms. This could mean that India is headed back to the days of coalition raj, much like in the nineties when small political parties that had emerged from the fringes came to the mainstream and played kingmakers, thus destabilising governments much like in present-day Nepal.

No matter how fool-proof an image you build of yourself as an invincible leader on the back of a subservient media, there is a community of silent voters waiting for the right moment to make a course correction. That the Indian electorate has shattered the prospect of establishing a ‘one party state’ in the globe’s largest democracy will also give heart to those fighting for democratic rights everywhere in the world.  ","summary":"The National Democratic Alliance, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, has clinched a victory for the third consecutive term in the Indian parliamentary elections, paving the way for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to continue his hold on power.

These farmers have asked for nothing more than the amount (around Rs5 billion) owed to them by private dairy companies since last August. For the same reason, the dairy farmers were compelled to spill milk in a March protest before reaching an agreement with three private dairy companies, the state-owned Dairy Development Cooperation (DDC) and the Ministry of Agriculture, to clear the payments by April 3. But all their effort went in vain, prompting them to plan yet another protest if their dues were not settled in the next two weeks.The plight of dairy farmers suggests utter neglect of this vital sector. Be it vegetable producers, sugarcane growers or dairy farmers, inadequate plans and policies to address their demands have left the farmers struggling. Reduced income has hit all aspects of the economy, and consumers are unable to buy dairy products. Even the sweltering heat, which would usually boost the demand for dairy products, has failed to do so. The government’s failure to address the core problem of the economy has had a significant impact on consumers and has spilled over to farmers.Market insiders have noted that the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government, without conducting proper market study, hiked the price of milk in March last year: Rs9.1 per litre in the minimum purchase price of raw milk paid to farmers, bringing the price up to Rs65.5. Following that, in the same month, DDC also set the price of half-litre milk at Rs48.50, by raising Rs5.50. However, this price is still high in Nepali market, leading many to import from the southern neighbour India. As a result, while Nepal produces over six million litres of milk a day with roughly 300,000 homes contributing, between 500,000 and 600,000 million litres go unsold due to the lack of market, as per the government’s economic survey (2023-24). The dairy farmers thus got no benefit from the price hike. The dairy companies, citing the economic crisis, don’t appear to have taken significant steps to solve this problem. They claim that their capacity to store butter is already exhausted, and they haven’t been able to buy milk and pay the farmers. During vital periods like these, the companies should have adequate storage systems to retain dairy products for high-demand times like Dashain and Tihar, explore international markets, and find new ways to attract consumers at home through quality dairy products. Additionally, the Central Dairy Cooperative Association—a key player in knocking the doors of the government to pay the rightful amount to the farmers—is yet to finalise measures to clear outstanding dues. It is not known why the government and private dairy companies haven’t settled the issue. Farmers who end up throwing milk on roads but fail to understand the demand-supply fluctuation are also to blame. Cooperatives and government authorities should work together to educate and encourage farmers to adopt agricultural insurance schemes, which cover 80 percent of the government subsidy. As an immediate measure, it is the state’s prime duty to pay attention to the farmers’ woes. Clearing the outstanding dues of Rs5 billion shouldn’t be much of a hassle considering that the sector contributes around five percent to the country’s gross domestic product.  ","summary":"Nepal’s dairy farmers are facing renewed hardships with the government repeatedly failing to heed them.

The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement. ","summary":"Lawmaker Jiban Pariyar, a joint general secretary of the Nepali Congress, the main opposition, was a member of the four-member taskforce that prepared the terms of reference (ToR) of the parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that.

During her four-day visit, she interacted with people from all walks of life, including the prime minister, in an attempt to gauge the human rights situation here. In this interview with Binod Ghimire of the Post, Callamard talked about the human rights situation in Nepal and the rest of the world. Excerpts: You have been travelling this part of the world, interacting with people. How do you evaluate the human rights situation here?Human rights are backsliding everywhere. It’s a global phenomenon. There is backsliding on civil and political rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is backsliding on women’s rights and non-discrimination on economic rights, and in terms of armed conflicts. The number of people dying in armed conflicts is increasing exponentially. We are in deep trouble as far as human rights protection is concerned. The South Asia region hasn’t been immune to the global trend.For my mission, I am visiting Sri Lanka and Nepal. In the two countries, we observe the shrinking of civic space and greater weaponisation of laws to curtail freedom of expression, particularly online. The digital laws are often overbroad and disproportionate. Banning TikTok in Nepal, for instance, is a disproportionate overbroad measure of the violation of international laws. We are observing a great deal of attacks in protests. The use of lethal force or disproportionate use of force by the police in response to even peaceful protests is increasing. There are incidents where protestors have died after the use of police force. There are issues of impunity for past crimes. A study by a European research centre shows that fewer people live in democracies worldwide in 2024 than in 1986. This is a complete U-turn. What do you see as the reasons for the backsliding? There are several factors that explain the backsliding. One could be growing restlessness and anxiety due to economic downturns. There was a severe financial crisis in 2008, and we didn't really recover from it. The inequalities within states and between states have increased in the last decade. We have seen a sharp increase in the wealth of the super-rich. On the other hand, the poor are getting poorer. This is feeding anger and creating fertile ground for populism. The authoritarian leaders are feeding on that particular ground. The backsliding is also linked to Covid that had a terrible impact on the economy and society. During Covid, the governments adopted different emergency measures but, in many cases, those measures were never lifted. In Europe, refugees, migrants and minorities are viewed as the reasons why the economy is not picking up and they are accused of stealing jobs. In every country, the minorities have been made the scapegoats. There is a resentment that democracy has not delivered for the people. The expectations are high, but the governments have failed to act accordingly. Therefore, the people are prepared to listen to the authoritarian leaders. By authoritarian leaders, I do not mean those who are in power by force but those who are democratically elected. They are elected by the people, but they practise authoritarianism once they get into power. In Nepal, the burning problem of authoritarianism has been reflected even in local politics. For instance, the mayor of Kathmandu has resorted to repeated attacks against street vendors and landless people. These are authoritarian moves. Such leaders target vulnerable groups who cannot protect themselves. You are in Nepal at a time the government has arrested the owner of the largest media house. How does Amnesty International look at this situation?We are very alarmed and upset. We call on the government to release him immediately. Even if the charges are valid, they certainly do not justify imprisoning him. Amnesty International believes that the use of those charges is politically motivated and is an attempt to stifle dissent. It is a response to the professional investigation and reporting about the policies and practices of those in power. This is an attempt to silence him, to silence the news media and to silence journalists. By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights.We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority.Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated?Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected.We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology.Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesn’t stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Do you think other countries should follow the European Union’s footsteps?Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings.Why do you think Nepal’s transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward?Sadly, the transitional justice process hasn’t progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. That’s the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice.You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutors’ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire. This is nonsense.Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. In fact, peace is not sustainable without justice. When justice is not delivered, the conflict is bound to recur. It is just a matter of time. We often hear the excuse that if a particular leader or a person is prosecuted, that would affect peace. On the contrary, not investigating the perpetrator is a real challenge to peace. Many people who are in power after a peace deal themselves are guilty of war crimes. They don’t want to be held accountable. It is not in their interest to deliver transitional justice. It takes an incredible, highly moral and principled leadership to take the process ahead.We have seen here that the transitional justice process has been paralysed. Successive governments have failed to act on the Comprehensive Peace Accord. They haven’t acted on what the Supreme Court told them in 2015. It had directed them to review, revise and reform the Transitional Justice Act.Here I have seen the categorisation of crimes as serious and non-serious, which is very strange. It is shocking to me that some killings are considered non-serious, and could lead to de facto amnesty for those responsible for them, even though these crimes fall under international law. If someone was killed after torture then two crimes have been committed—torture and killing. Right to life is the most important right. The investigation should be done accordingly. The same is the case with sexual violence with rape and without rape.What is alarming is that people are losing trust. If people do not trust the systems that are supposed to deliver justice, that will cause a big problem. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons couldn’t undertake proper investigation and prosecution. Not all have received the government’s relief, which has led to much frustration and animosity. There is political interference on transitional justice, which also lacks independence and transparency.We are calling on the authorities to act as directed by the Supreme Court, ratify the statute on the International Criminal Court as well as the International Convention on Disappearance. Do you see chances of international interference if Nepal continues to delay justice delivery?There is no doubt that some crimes committed during the war fall within universal jurisdiction. If the perpetrators of those crimes travel to countries where a framework of universal jurisdiction has been enacted, they could be arrested there. We are seeing the multiplication of universal jurisdiction cases in Europe.Cases of custodial deaths, torture and extrajudicial killings are common in Nepal. How can they be checked?Different organisations like Amnesty International should be monitoring the abuse of power by the police and state authorities. There must be impartial and fair investigation of such incidents. But there is a regime of impunity. The police are not very keen to investigate themselves. I wanted to mention the case of Ajit Mijar, which is an example of justice being denied. It also shows the complicity of the institution in denying justice.Nepal is ranked the fourth most vulnerable country due to climate change though it contributes negligibly in greenhouse gas emissions. The largest polluters haven't fulfilled their responsibilities towards Nepal. How can organisations like Amnesty advocate for countries like Nepal?Amnesty International has long been advocating for climate justice. We have a set of demands. We are advocating at the United Nations level and also at the COP. We are pushing through COP our message of loss and damage, about the responsibilities of industrialised countries to cut their reliance on fossil fuel industries and so on. The impact of global warming will lead to loss of lives in places like Nepal and Pacific Islands.We saw very timid steps taken in COP in UAE last year. These steps are far from sufficient. We see countries multiplying their investments in fossil fuel while big fossil fuel companies are also violating their written commitment to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. This is alarming.However, we have made some progress on loss and damage. Governments are recognising the principle of loss and damage for the countries that are least responsible for climate change. They can rely on some kind of global financial system to protect and support them in case of a sudden climate related crisis. We are now advocating for the responsible countries to set aside the necessary funds.Nepal is at the receiving end of climate change though the country is not responsible for it. However, the Nepali government also has a responsibility towards its people. The extreme weather risk faced by Nepal demands urgent acts from the authorities. The most vulnerable communities are at particular risk. The government must have instruments to protect them.  ","summary":"Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard was in Nepal last week as a part of her first South Asian tour.

The party has done poorly in all elections since its establishment. It has also failed in service delivery despite continuously being in the government since its inception. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal caught up with the party’s General Secretary, Ghanashyam Bhusal, for insights about the Unified Socialist’s upcoming general convention and broader political dynamics. Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer?Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation. After Oli’s election as the party leader, policy issues were undermined. In fact, we were at odds because of the policy issues.What were those policy disputes?We [our faction] believed that after the establishment of democratic republic system, the fight for a political system was almost over as this is the most progressive political system of our time. We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party. The new party was confused about the way forward. The upcoming general convention will formulate clear policies in this connection. What about the leadership? Will the party get new leadership?For the past two decades, I have been advocating that a communist party should adopt the right programmes to bring about social changes. At the time, the Maoists had a policy of seizing state power through force, and the UML was talking only about transforming society through elections. But the UML was basically engaged only in winning elections. In this context, we [a group of UML leaders] came up with some policies that would make substantive changes in such ritualistic practices.Now, I have been saying that our party should be led by a leader who can internalise and effectively implement those policies. We have almost finalised the party’s policy documents. When the documents are circulated among party workers, the debate about who is eligible to implement these policies will start.You often claim to be the proponent of the CPN (Unified Socialist)’s party line. If so, will you claim party leadership to implement those policies?The first condition to become the party leader is that he/she should internalise the policies and programmes adopted by the party. I shouldn’t say that no one besides me has internalised them. It is true that I have been actively leading the debates and discussions to introduce new policies in the party. Party representatives will debate and decide this at the convention.A large number of senior leaders quit the UML to form this party. But it couldn’t even retain its members let alone further expand.There was a need for radical reforms and restructuring in communist organisations and their policies. This should have been done by the country’s largest communist party—the CPN-UML. But the party leadership and its rank and file didn’t realise the need for it. There was no serious policy discussion in the UML. While the leadership of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and its organisation are oriented in the right direction, it’s not properly trained for such restructuring. Therefore, many even accused the party leadership of being just a follower and subservient to the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre. Various sections of society who had praised us for standing against Oli’s wrong decision didn’t appreciate other political moves of our party. Parliament dissolution was a political event. A party needs clear programmes and agenda to keep public support. Unfortunately, we were found wanting in this regard. We should have done something in job creation and increasing production. We will make such things clear at the upcoming convention. Since its formation, the party has been constantly bickered over power sharing with other parties and even party leaders always seem to be wrangling for ministerial berths. Don’t you think such activities weaken the party?This happened as the party lacked clear policies to move ahead. Standing against Oli became sort of its policy as there was deep resentment against him. As far as the leaders’ attachment to power is concerned, the party was born out of power [from Parliament, not from the ground]. So the struggle for power is linked to its genesis. It has been in power ever since its establishment. These allegations were hence natural, and the party leadership couldn’t clarify things. We couldn’t show what we did for the betterment of the society.Party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and other top leader Jhalanath Khanal seem to be working at cross-purposes. Nepal seems closer to the Congress while Khanal has been consistently lobbying for an alliance with the UML and the Maoist Centre.We have almost resolved this issue in the course of finalising the party’s policy document. Our conclusion is that, in general, the Congress mainly represents neoliberals and comprador capitalists. When we lobby for the country’s independent economic policy, the Congress may not agree. The party tilts more towards pro-western ideas in the name of liberalism. We in our party are in consensus that in the long-run we will compete against the Congress. But we shouldn’t forget that we got the current democratic system and the constitution only after fighting jointly with the Congress. So we have to keep our doors open for collaboration with the Congress in order to safeguard this system and the constitution. It is also historically proven that the Congress and left forces should stand together to safeguard democratic system. Thus we have now made our theoretical standing clearer.But in practical aspects, as you said, there are some differences. Party chair doesn’t want to increase distance with the Congress as he worked closely with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and other leaders to fight Oli ji. But Jhalanath Khanal ji is for left alliance.While there are already major communist forces such as the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, why is one more communist force, CPN (Unified Socialist), needed? How do you prove your relevance?The CPN-UML didn’t follow the right policies, even those endorsed by its general conventions. Party chief Oli wants total control of the party organisation, from the centre to the local units. The entire party is mobilised mainly to realise Oli’s personal ambitions. This party can’t work in favour of the society in the long run. The Maoist Centre hasn’t succeeded in transforming itself from war-era rigidity of Maoism. The Unified Socialist is here to correct these two major deviations of Nepal’s communist movement. Had the party raised this issue prominently right since its formation, people would have understood its relevance. We will do it now. This convention will be a landmark event in this connection as well. Many people think that the Unified Socialist will ultimately merge with the UML.Merger is not a solution. Even if you want to bring two parties together, you have to unify them. A merger brings top leaders together based on power sharing, just like the merger of the UML and Maoist Centre in 2018. Such a merger is guided mainly by the interests of certain leaders. That’s why the merger didn’t last. The need now is unification among communist parties based on policies and programmes. Otherwise, it will be nothing more than a gathering of leaders. There is no point in merging the party to make the UML bigger and make Oli prime minister one more time.As a leader of a ruling coalition partner, how confident are you of the stability of this alliance?Given the composition of the present Parliament, we can’t rule out the making and breaking of different coalitions until the next election. Oli ji used to talk of the Unified Socialist as a tumour removed after a surgery. His mindset that he can do anything in Nepali politics has suffered a setback. Therefore, he became ready for this coalition. If he has realised this change, this coalition will last. But if he again tries to manoeuvre to justify his dissolution of Parliament and serve any other interests, there might even be other coalitions.Why has your party been in a state of disharmony with coalition partners right from the beginning?Initially, the prime minister didn’t consult with us while making this coalition. That created misunderstanding. He eventually admitted his mistake in failing to inform us on time and sought our support. So, that chapter was closed. Now we have no issue at the party’s level, and officially, we are committed to this coalition. ","summary":"The CPN (Unified Socialist), which was fashioned in 2021 by a splinter faction of the CPN-UML, is preparing to hold its first general convention. The party has done poorly in all elections since its establishment. It has also failed in service delivery despite continuously being in the government since its inception. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal caught up with the party’s General Secretary, Ghanashyam Bhusal, for insights about the Unified Socialist’s upcoming general convention and broader political dynamics. Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer?Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation.

Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   ","summary":"United Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal Hanaa Singer-Hamdy has worked for close to 30 years across development and humanitarian contexts in senior management and strategic leadership roles.

You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   "},{"hash":"5c619766187ad60db035eb5fb0a4828e4ac42bc0629ee09b9e9b651003b196e9","title":"today-s-weather-june-9-2024","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/weather/2024/06/09/today-s-weather-june-9-2024","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/thumb85-1717901126.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1717891200000,"source":"kp","category":"weather","content":"The weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy in Koshi Province along with high hilly regions of Bagmati Province and partly cloudy to mainly fair throughout the country on Sunday.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur in some places of Koshi, Bagmati and Gandaki provinces and one or two areas of the rest of the country, the Meteorological Forecasting Division said.Tonight, it will be partly to generally cloudy in the Koshi along with the hilly regions of Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the Province.Likewise, light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning will likely occur in a few places in Koshi Province.
