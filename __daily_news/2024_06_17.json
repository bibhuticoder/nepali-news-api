Regular cleaning is being carried out at the ward level to mitigate the risk, Maharjan added.\nIn preparation for any potential outbreaks, the local government has ensured the availability of essential supplies such as cetamol and Jeevan Jal for those affected by dengue. The supplies will be coordinated through the health promotion centers at the ward level.\nMoreover, teams comprising center employees, volunteers, and sanitation workers are busy in finding areas with accumulated water, a breeding ground for mosquitoes, and cleaning them.\nThe local government also planned to undertake bio-larvicide spraying activities if deemed necessary to combat the spread of dengue infection.\n"},{"hash":"2c6363dedf3280a4e1b505cf5610b74b3a1f3d5e834457952e5e45b1952a28fc","title":"committee-to-address-complaints-of-long-queue-for-surgery","date":1717200000000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/health/committee-to-address-complaints-of-long-queue-for-surgery","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/MoHP_Health_Ministry_Ministry_of_Health_and_Population1679644101_10241697441609_1024.jpg","category":"health","content":"\n Considering the widespread complaints of patients having to wait for months and even years for a surgery in hospitals across the country, the Ministry of Health and Population has formed a special committee to study and address the problem. Minister for Health and Population Pradeep Yadav formed a three-member committee to study the problem and present a report along with solutions and recommendations.

As there is no specific treatment for dengue, officials said they are planning to train doctors to provide supportive care to seriously ailing dengue patients.“We have been working to train doctors serving at state-run health facilities to treat dengue patients,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We hope the training will help doctors manage cases more effectively.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,175 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 122. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, increasing numbers of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as the outbreak of the virus is reported every month including in the winter months.Health authorities in Nepal claimed that lessons from managing Covid cases would help them combat other outbreaks, but the massive infections and spread of the dengue virus before the onset of the monsoon cast doubt on these claims.“Every year, scores die and hundreds of thousands get infected from the dengue virus, but no agency in the country is doing much on disease prevention,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, a public health expert. “There are three tiers of government in the country, and the relevant agency in each government—federal, provincial and local—shifts responsibility to another. When you ask the agency under the local level, they say they are not there to kill mosquitoes.”Experts say health authorities have done little to cut down on the risks, except counting the number of infected people and issuing statements. The public, too, has become less vigilant about dengue infections, they sayAccording to entomologists, reducing the spread of the dengue virus is impossible without coordinated efforts from all relevant agencies and individuals.“Several preemptive measures, including a search-and-destroy campaign of mosquito breeding sites, are necessary to curb the spread of the virus,” said Sishir Panta, an entomologist. “People should be made aware of the risks, so awareness drives should be launched. Authorities should deploy community workers to inspect households to find and destroy mosquito breeding grounds.”Experts say this is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks.Waiting for a massive outbreak would be a big mistake, they say. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.

This age-old question has divided experts and legislators. While NGOs have long been active in Nepal’s lawmaking process, controversy flared anew when NGO representatives were found attending Sunday’s session of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of Parliament without the knowledge of many lawmakers. The committee was scheduled to discuss the federal civil code amendment bill with expert input from Umesh Mainali, the former chief of the Public Service Commission. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane was also present at the meeting. However, the meeting took an unexpected turn when lawmakers noticed an elaborate breakfast and lunch arrangement, a departure from usual tea and simple fare. This led to questions about the sponsorship.Upon noticing the breakfast arrangement in the committee hall, Nepali Congress lawmaker Hridaya Ram Thani approached the committee president for clarification. It was revealed that the breakfast was arranged by an NGO, whose representatives were present in the meeting hall, leading to an abrupt adjournment of the meeting without any agenda being discussed.“After knowing that the lunch was sponsored by an NGO, Home Minister Lamichhane left the meeting hall,” Thani told the Post. Before leaving, Lamichhane also questioned the committee chair stating that it was unacceptable to hold a meeting with the breakfast sponsored by an NGO, Thani said, quoting Lamichhane. The National Forum for Parliamentarians on Population and Development (NFPPD), an NGO, had sponsored the breakfast and lunch for lawmakers. Two representatives of the NGO, Ram Guragain and Arinika Rai, were present in the committee meeting hall. Amidst the disruption, committee members raised questions about the role of Ramhari Khatiwada, the Congress lawmaker who leads the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, concerning the NGO’s catering arrangements.But Khatiwada denied any involvement. “I was not aware of the presence of the NGO representatives in the meeting, or of the breakfast arrangement,” Khatiwada told the Post. “After we knew about it, we cancelled the meeting.” “Though other parliamentary committees might allow NGO representatives to attend meetings, our committee does not permit such things,” added Khatiwada. However, CPN-UML lawmaker Prithvi Subba Gurung dismissed the issue. “If necessary, people from various walks of life can be invited to the committee to discuss various agenda,” Gurung told the Post. “There was no reason for disruption.” Mainali, who was invited for his expert input to Sunday’s committee meeting, echoed Gurung and said various stakeholders can participate in committee discussions, but they are excluded when the committee engages in agenda-specific discussions. “In my understanding, the controversy arose not due to the participation of the NGO’s representatives, but because of the breakfast and lunch they arranged,” Mainali told the Post. However, the committee member and lawmaker of Congress, Ishwari Devi Neupane, has a different view. Neupane argues that the presence of NGO representatives could influence a forum dedicated to formulating state laws. “If we allow representatives of an NGO into committee meetings, other NGOs might seek similar permission, and this could impact the lawmaking process,” Neupane told the Post. “That is why we questioned the presence of the NGO that sponsored today’s breakfast and lunch.” Neupane stressed that while agendas can be openly discussed with the representatives of civil society and NGOs outside the committee hall, inviting them to committee meetings is a wrong practice. However, NFPPD representative Guragain, who was present at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee meeting, said his organisation directly deals with parliamentarians and is often invited to such meetings. “We participated in Sunday’s discussion because we have been taking part in discussions in other committees as well,” Guragain told the Post. “We had an invitation letter to the meeting from the parliamentary committee.”However, former minister Ramesh Nath Pandey says incorporating the agendas of INGOs and NGOs into the lawmaking process is wrong and such practice must end. Pandey said such influences were more visible during the constitution-drafting process. “External elements are present not only during the drafting of policy papers, but also in the workings of sensitive institutions and law drafting.

He had totally waived customs duty on imported pig iron and scrap.Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun, however, reintroduced the customs duty to 2.5 percent on sponge iron imports and 1 percent on pig and scrap iron imports in the budget for the next fiscal year beginning mid-July. The budget was announced on May 28. Industrialists warn that they would knock on the court’s door if the government failed to roll back its decision. They said that the policy had been amended in a short period to discourage investment. \"Instead of encouraging investment, the government has changed the policy out of nowhere,\" said Agrawal in a press meeting in Bhairahawa last week. “The government has taken an unpopular move without taking advice and inputs from the private sector. The government has not done any study before reintroducing the policy.\" “This is a policy flaw. It needs to be corrected.”Steel and iron producers say that such policies may harm the manufacturing industry in the long term. \"If we want to become self-reliant on iron, there is a need for an encouraging environment. But unfortunately, the government is least bothered.\"The industrialists, who have been importing raw materials and producing iron rods through melting, have been requesting the prime minister and finance minister, as well as leaders of various political parties, to roll back the decision.\"Due to the government’s policy three years ago of encouraging iron and steel industries, investors decided to pour money into the manufacturing sector. But the abrupt changes in policy have put them in a fix,\" Agrawal said.Five melting furnace factory plants were in operation three years ago. Due to the new policy, the number of such factories increased. In three years, the number of melting furnace plants has increased to 18.Five are in Rupandehi, four in Morang, seven in Birgunj, and one each in Kapilvastu and Banke.The iron and steel industry manufactures billets by mixing scrap material with imported sponge iron from India. The billet produced within the country is made from 75 percent sponge iron and 25 percent scrap iron. The billet produced this way is rolled and made into iron rods.Agrawal said Rs36 billion had been invested in a dozen and a half such plants, which employ 5,000 people and produce around 2.3 million tonnes of iron rods annually.With the government policy of producing billet within the country, the rolling mills also installed the melting furnace technology at that time. They invested Rs1 billion more into the technology, said Agrawal.The finance ministry encouraged the private sector to open such plants to increase electricity consumption within the country, and this industry pays electricity bills amounting to Rs15 billion annually.However, with the government preparing to provide a waiver in excise duty on billets at customs points, the rolling mill operators in Rupandehi have expressed their happiness. The government, through the budget for the upcoming fiscal year, has announced the removal of an excise duty of Rs2,500 per tonne on imported billets imposed at customs points.The government provision has created hope for the industries that were shut down. The rolling industry entrepreneurs in Rupandehi and neighbouring districts who were producing iron rods by importing billet have been conducting phase-wise protests for two years to remove the customs and excise duties.The industrialists said that the government, understanding reality, has decided to remove the excise duty, which they said is a justifiable decision from the government.\"The government, through the budget, has addressed our demand partially,\" said Dhurba Kumar Shrestha, vice-chairman of Panchakanya Group. \"The rolling mill industry entrepreneurs were confident that the government would address our demand one day as millions of investment was about to sink.”With the issuance of Financial Bill 2024, it has created an environment for the iron industry, which is produced using imported billets, to compete in the market, Shrestha said.Shrestha said that the customs charges need to be uniform when importing raw materials for the industry that produces the same goods, and this is the major demand of rolling mill operators.With the government's change in policy, employment will regenerate.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. ","summary":"In a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu.

Given the multifaceted nature of Nepal-India ties, the open border and Nepal’s heavy trade reliance on the southern neighbour, iffy relations with India can make life difficult for the Nepali head of government. There is also a corollary to this hard reality. Whenever the Nepali leader feels New Delhi is unhappy with him, he will invariably make an overture to the other neighbour, China. In the eyes of top Nepali leaders, China has always been seen as the power whose good graces can give them legitimacy as true nationalists. So they at least have to make a show of promoting ties with Beijing. This also helps keep New Delhi honest. To sum up, for most Nepali leaders, China is worth cultivating only to the extent of boosting their nationalist credentials. The issues of national interest are often the least of their concern. Nepal and China have vastly increased bilateral engagements in the post-pandemic period. On June 25, the two countries are to meet for a foreign secretary-level talks. Before that, the Joint Expert Group will sit to sort out boundary-related matters. Many outstanding issues will be discussed in the pair of meetings, from trade, transit, connectivity, investment, health, tourism, poverty alleviation, disaster management, education, culture to people-to-people exchanges. To make discussions more substantive, the Nepali side has requested China that the current bilateral mechanism at foreign secretary-level be elevated to the level of foreign ministers. That makes sense. It is also in the interest of both the sides to quickly settle outstanding border disputes, just like they amicably settled the dispute on height of Mt Everest back in 2020. Other nagging suspicions also need to be cleared up. For instance, the Chinese say there is no environment for their contractors and workers to work in Nepal, which in turn accounts for delays in various projects. Yet Nepali officials maintain that it is the Chinese who are, for instance, inexplicably delaying expansion and maintenance of several road projects and in handing over the detailed project report of the second phase of the Kathmandu Ring Road.While Nepali leaders have been guilty of playing the ‘China card’, the Chinese too have appeared less than enthusiastic on improving bilateral ties. The cooperation on the BRI has stalled, largely because of differences over funding modality, with Nepal wanting more grants and the Chinese pushing for more loans. Yet there would be fewer differences if there was greater transparency on China’s part, which is missing in, say, the Chinese funding of the Pokhara International Airport. Instead of trying to clear the air on these issues through bilateral channels, the Chinese have taken to social media with gusto. This suggests a gap in communication between official channels of the two countries. If Nepal-China relations are to progress and mature, ways must be found to reduce this gap. Our leaders’ reduction of China as a counterweight to India and a tool to burnish their nationalist credentials is as harmful as the new wolf warrior diplomacy of the Chinese diplomats. In order to improve ties, what the two countries should do is try to better understand each other while also respecting their differences—not just in their speeches but also in reality.    ","summary":"Nepali prime ministers, irrespective of their political affiliation, have over the years tried to cultivate the best of relations with New Delhi.

This is an unsurprising concern, considering how floods and landslides are recurrent threats during the rainy season in Nepal. National statistics reveal that these disasters cause an average of about 300 people to lose their lives and hundreds to become homeless every year. The loss of hundreds of hectares of crops drives poverty even deeper into the most affected communities. This monsoon seems to be even more worrisome because it will likely bring more rain to several parts of the country. The extreme events of floods and droughts caused by the changing climate are occurring more frequently than anticipated. Considering how rainfall patterns in recent years have increasingly been dominated by high-intensity, short-duration rains, the havoc likely to be created by above-average rain will undoubtedly be severe. It’s time to pause and mull over why our approach to addressing floods and landslides has been ineffective and lacking. Government’s preparation As the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority specified, as many as 1.8 million people across the country could be vulnerable this year. The government must prepare to rescue potentially 18,000 families. This is the first time the government has scrounged up a plan to rescue an estimated number of people should the disaster strike. Major political parties have even agreed to prepare volunteers who could be mobilised as and when needed to support this plan. Arrangements have been made to halt the Melamchi project water supply to save the tunnel from filling with sediment if the river experiences high floods—a costly lesson the project learned two years ago when heavy rain in the head watershed area deposited massive amounts of debris in the river bed, burying the project's intake. Encouraged by the success of the Early Warning System (EWS) application in saving lives and property during the floods in Tarai, the government has also announced developing an ambitious early warning system for multiple hazards—landslides, avalanches, wildfires and air pollution—in the next few years at an estimated cost of Rs81 billion. These welcome initiatives demonstrate the government's prioritising the reduction of disaster risks and Nepal's progress in making preparations to reduce disaster risks. However, the scale and nature of the climate risks we face are challenging in their complexity and, therefore, can only be addressed in their entirety by adopting a two-pronged approach: Mainstreaming climate change in our development plans rather than on ad hoc or project basis and changing the old practice to match the newly developing climate scenario. Unfortunately, this isn't happening. How we have acknowledged climate-related issues in the most crucial sector of agriculture shows this disconnect. The disconnectThe second National Climate Change Survey (NCCS) report published last month was a timely reminder of the concerning scenario facing us. Disasters have continually hit much of Nepal’s agriculture in the previous 25 years. Droughts have emerged as a major problem impacting nearly 45 percent of households, followed by floods affecting about 14 percent. Wind storms have battered farms of roughly 10 percent of farming households. Water sources in and around villages have dried up or are drying across the country, irrespective of geographical region, primarily affecting food production. Many farmers have also reported an increase in the number and variety of insects and diseases affecting crops. However, when the government announced its federal budget on May 28, there was no mention of any of these signature climate impacts on Nepal’s agriculture, let alone any semblance of a plan to address them. One can argue that the preparation of plans for agriculture falls on the local governments, but climate change is also a national issue and one would expect a national agenda, particularly what the federal government hopes to achieve through its budget. The budget, now being deliberated on in the federal parliament, is likely to pass without any member of parliament raising any questions, based on the findings of the NCCS, about the climate impacts on agriculture. If such findings aren’t the bedrock of policymaking and planning, suffice it to say surveys will become meaningless. Irrespective of the government's priorities, the incoming above-average rain will hit every sector, including agriculture and crop production. But what kind of impacts do we expect? How will the location-specific impacts on crops pose different challenges for different demographics? Knowledge about and an understanding of the anticipated impacts and the affected communities in those areas would help prepare for such eventualities. However, there is no such information available. Agriculture continues to be the least prioritised in our climate discourse for an obvious reason—our reduced dependence on it. With the economic base shifting from farm-based income to remittance for many, the state hasn’t felt the full brunt of the unending climate impacts on agriculture, a key economic sector. Furthermore, the budget failed to acknowledge the climate impacts on agriculture because climate change is still dealt with in isolation, despite efforts over the decade to make it part of plans and budgets of all climate-relevant sectors, including agriculture. With the current trend and pace, it can be said that we aren’t on the right path for adaptation. Reevaluating our approachClimate scientists have been warning us of the accelerating climate impacts, and we see them unfolding. In the past few years, heavy rains causing damaging floods and landslides have been experienced even before the fully active monsoon. In May 2020, Panauti, a small historical town east of Kathmandu, witnessed unexpected floods; on June 16, 2021, heavy rains damaged Melamchi Valley. Floods and landslides also caused fatalities and destroyed homes in several districts in the second week of June 2022. In 2023, about 30 hydropower projects in eastern Nepal suffered damages from floods. Further, heavy rains were reported on June 12, 2024, causing landslides and floods, damaging a few homes in east Nepal. Such floods at the early stages of monsoon weren't common in the past. Our efforts haven't been in tune with the pace at which devastating climate impacts are being experienced. As a result, no concrete actions are being taken to address the developing scenario except for some symbolic, palliative gestures. The NCCS told us exactly how the changing climate is hurting us and who stands to suffer the most. The (failing) conventional approach to address the issue must change now. ","summary":"Come June, worry sets in for those living in the hills along the river banks or flood plains as to how this year's monsoon will fare. This is an unsurprising concern, considering how floods and landslides are recurrent threats during the rainy season in Nepal. National statistics reveal that these disasters cause an average of about 300 people to lose their lives and hundreds to become homeless every year. The loss of hundreds of hectares of crops drives poverty even deeper into the most affected communities. This monsoon seems to be even more worrisome because it will likely bring more rain to several parts of the country. The extreme events of floods and droughts caused by the changing climate are occurring more frequently than anticipated. Considering how rainfall patterns in recent years have increasingly been dominated by high-intensity, short-duration rains, the havoc likely to be created by above-average rain will undoubtedly be severe. It’s time to pause and mull over why our approach to addressing floods and landslides has been ineffective and lacking. Government’s preparation As the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority specified, as many as 1.8 million people across the country could be vulnerable this year. The government must prepare to rescue potentially 18,000 families. This is the first time the government has scrounged up a plan to rescue an estimated number of people should the disaster strike. Major political parties have even agreed to prepare volunteers who could be mobilised as and when needed to support this plan. Arrangements have been made to halt the Melamchi project water supply to save the tunnel from filling with sediment if the river experiences high floods—a costly lesson the project learned two years ago when heavy rain in the head watershed area deposited massive amounts of debris in the river bed, burying the project's intake. Encouraged by the success of the Early Warning System (EWS) application in saving lives and property during the floods in Tarai, the government has also announced developing an ambitious early warning system for multiple hazards—landslides, avalanches, wildfires and air pollution—in the next few years at an estimated cost of Rs81 billion. These welcome initiatives demonstrate the government's prioritising the reduction of disaster risks and Nepal's progress in making preparations to reduce disaster risks. However, the scale and nature of the climate risks we face are challenging in their complexity and, therefore, can only be addressed in their entirety by adopting a two-pronged approach: Mainstreaming climate change in our development plans rather than on ad hoc or project basis and changing the old practice to match the newly developing climate scenario. Unfortunately, this isn't happening. How we have acknowledged climate-related issues in the most crucial sector of agriculture shows this disconnect. The disconnectThe second National Climate Change Survey (NCCS) report published last month was a timely reminder of the concerning scenario facing us. Disasters have continually hit much of Nepal’s agriculture in the previous 25 years. Droughts have emerged as a major problem impacting nearly 45 percent of households, followed by floods affecting about 14 percent. Wind storms have battered farms of roughly 10 percent of farming households. Water sources in and around villages have dried up or are drying across the country, irrespective of geographical region, primarily affecting food production. Many farmers have also reported an increase in the number and variety of insects and diseases affecting crops. However, when the government announced its federal budget on May 28, there was no mention of any of these signature climate impacts on Nepal’s agriculture, let alone any semblance of a plan to address them. One can argue that the preparation of plans for agriculture falls on the local governments, but climate change is also a national issue and one would expect a national agenda, particularly what the federal government hopes to achieve through its budget. The budget, now being deliberated on in the federal parliament, is likely to pass without any member of parliament raising any questions, based on the findings of the NCCS, about the climate impacts on agriculture. If such findings aren’t the bedrock of policymaking and planning, suffice it to say surveys will become meaningless.

Our future”. The theme for this year’s World Environment Day, emphasising land restoration, combating desertification and building resilience to drought, encompasses the pressing issues of this era which need careful intervention. The scale and intensity of the impacts of land degradation, desertification and drought are alarming. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) states that up to 40 percent of the world’s land is degraded, adversely impacting around 3.2 billion people. Projections also indicate that over three-quarters of the world's population by 2050 will be affected by drought. These impacts manifest in several aspects of life and nature, including loss of biodiversity and ecosystems, depletion of resources, food insecurity, livelihood and ultimate human existence. In recent times, land degradation induced by physical, chemical and biological processes has been accelerated by human activities. The main culprits include haphazard infrastructure development, industrialisation, high carbon-intensive energy use, overgrazing and excessive extraction of natural resources without consideration of environmental sustainability. Prolonged droughts are becoming more common and climate change adds uncertainty and complexities to their occurrences. Nepal’s vulnerabilityNepal’s young mountains are geologically fragile and complex. Located in a tectonically active zone, the whole land mass from the Himalayas in the North to the Siwalik in the South is susceptible to peculiar challenges, especially erosion, landslides and floods. Anthropogenic activities in this hazard-prone region, including haphazard infrastructure construction, land use change, and chemical fertiliser and pesticide overuse, exacerbate these natural phenomena. For instance, road construction on the slopes without due consideration to the environment and slope stabilisation in the last decade has increased incidents of landslides and slope failures. Excessive extraction of resources from rivers is another concern. While regulatory provisions in the Environment Protection Act and Regulation mandate comprehensive assessment, project developers often perceive such provisions as a burden. Limited focus on the implementation of the Environmental Management Plan, compliance monitoring and evaluation, and audits are the reasons behind haphazard resource extraction and the continuation of environmentally unsustainable projects.Soil loss through erosion, a serious threat to soil health, results in agricultural yield decline, ecosystem degradation, habitat destruction and several economic impacts. A 2016 study by the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) estimated 40 million tons of soil loss between 1990 and 2010 in the Koshi basin. Identification of arable soil loss areas is critical for effective land management planning focused on conservation measures. The 61st report of the Office of the Auditor General pointed out that the content of soil organic matter currently stands at 2.83 against the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of 3.37. Policy interventionsA 2018 report titled “Land degradation neutrality target setting program in Nepal” set three targets to be achieved by 2030: i) Increase forest cover to 44.7 percent; ii) increase agricultural growth by 6 percent; iii) increase Soil Organic Carbon in forest and cropland by 1 percent per annum and iv) restoring 10 percent of wetland ecosystem out of 26277 sq. hectares of wetlands. Among these, Nepal’s success in increasing forest cover from 39.6 percent in 1993 to 44.74 percent in 2018 is praised all over the world as one of the best-case examples of sustainable forest management initiatives. Despite this achievement, the recent episodes of forest fires during the pre-monsoon period are worrisome. The attainment of other targets requires concentrated effort by building synergies and collaboration among national policies/strategies and different climate action programmes. For instance, Land Use Policy, Agriculture Development Strategy, Nepal Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan and Climate Change Policy are required to be aligned on its objectives, strategies and programmes. At the programme level, for instance, the National Climate Change Support Programme, the National Adaptation Plan, and the President Chure Terai Madesh Conservation Programme need to focus on a collaborative approach; eliminating duplication and creating synergies among beneficiaries and outcome of this programme. Research on drought shows an increasing trend in both the intensity and frequency of drought occurrences. The impacts of drought are significantly higher in rain-fed agricultural regions like Nepal, which rely extensively on the monsoon. Droughts result in crop failures and food insecurity, which is why region-specific explorations of droughts are essential for effective drought monitoring and risk mitigation. A 2021 study indicated that summer drought events have increased fivefold in the central region, doubled in the eastern region, and not significantly changed in the western region of Nepal. These incidences have severe implications for vulnerable communities that are mostly dependent on subsentence agriculture for their livelihood. As a result, difficulty in local livelihoods prevails, which acts as a “push factor” leading to increased migration from rural to urban city centres and abroad. Soil healthHealthy soil is the foundation not only of agricultural systems and food security but also of the existence of humans. So, data management should be a priority towards understanding and analysing the pattern, trend and hotspots of land degradation and droughts. Sustainable land management programmes should incorporate soil conservation and watershed management, soil fertility management and improvement, community forestry programmes, technology development, and research and development. Climate-smart agriculture and the implementation and monitoring of environmental management plans are equally important. For these programmes to be successful, functional coordination mechanisms and institutional arrangements are pivotal. Further, opportunities to tap climate finance for implementing adaptation programmes at the local level will be crucial. But the state alone cannot address the land degradation problem; rather, collaboration among all sectors and stakeholders, including civil society, the private sector, and the general public, is essential for achieving the desired outcomes in restoring land, combating desertification and building drought resilience.

Russia ridiculed the event from afar. A decision by China to stay away all but assured that the summit would fail to achieve Ukraine’s goal of persuading major countries from the “global South” to join in isolating Russia.Brazil attended only as an “observer”. And in the end, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and South Africa all withheld their signatures from the summit communique, even though some contentious issues were omitted in the hope of drawing wider support.Still, the conference provided Kyiv with a chance to showcase the support from Western allies that it says it needs to keep fighting against a far bigger enemy.“We are responding to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine not only with a full-scale defense of human life, but also with full-scale diplomacy,” Zelenskiy said.Leaders including US Vice President Kamala Harris, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron gathered at the mountaintop resort of Buergenstock. US President Joe Biden, in Europe for other events last week, did not attend despite public invitations from Zelenskiy.The frontlines in Ukraine have barely moved since the end of 2022, despite tens of thousands of dead on both sides in relentless trench warfare, the bloodiest fighting in Europe since World War Two.In her closing remarks, Swiss President Viola Amherd warned that the “road ahead is long and challenging”.Russia, as it has for weeks, mocked the gathering.“None of the participants in the ‘peace forum’ knows what he is doing there and what his role is,” said Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president and now deputy chairman of the country's Security Council.‘THINGS CAN’T GO ON LIKE THIS’After initial Ukrainian successes that saw Kyiv repel an assault on the capital and recapture territory in the war’s first year, a major Ukrainian counter-offensive using donated Western tanks fizzled last year. Russian forces still hold a fifth of Ukraine and are again advancing, albeit slowly. No peace talks have been held for more than two years.“We know that peace in Ukraine will not be achieved in one step, it will be a journey,” European Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen said, calling for “patience and determination”.“It was not a peace negotiation because (Russia’s President Vladimir) Putin is not serious about ending the war, he’s insisting on capitulation, he's insisting on ceding Ukrainian territory - even territory that today is not occupied.”In the absence of a clear path to ending the war, Zelenskiy emphasised practical issues, such as nuclear safety and securing food supplies from Ukraine, one of the world's biggest grain exporters.The summit’s final declaration called for Ukraine’s control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and its Azov Sea ports to be restored. But in line with the conference’s more modest stated aims, it omitted tougher issues of what a post-war settlement for Ukraine might look like, whether Ukraine could join the NATO alliance or how troop withdrawals from both sides might work.“The more allies that can be found to say ‘Things can't go on like this’, ‘This is too much’, ‘That’s overstepping the mark’, that also increases the moral pressure on the Russian Federation,” said Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer.As Sunday’s talks turned towards issues of food security and nuclear power, some leaders left early.No country came forward to host another such meeting, with notable silence from Saudi Arabia, mooted as a possible future venue. Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said the kingdom was ready to assist the peace process but a viable settlement would hinge on “difficult compromise.”Since initial peace talks in the first months after the Feb. 2022 invasion, Ukraine has consistently demanded Russia withdraw from all its land, while Moscow has demanded recognition of its rule over territory its forces captured.Last week, in remarks clearly aimed at the conference, Putin said Russia would not halt the war until Kyiv withdraws its forces fully from four provinces that Moscow only partially controls and claims to have annexed. Kyiv swiftly denounced that as a demand for surrender.“Of course we...understand perfectly that a time will come when it will be necessary to talk to Russia,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said. “But our position is very clear: We will not allow Russia to speak in the language of ultimatums like it is speaking now.”Western leaders at the summit endorsed Kyiv’s refusal to negotiate under such terms.“Confusing peace with subjugation would set a dangerous precedent for everyone,” said Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.

Nepal endured a violent Maoist insurgency from 1996, which ended after ten years with a comprehensive peace accord in 2006.Bhandari addressed the council as a representative of the Global Alliance of the Missing, advocating for families of missing and disappeared people across the world.“The world has not done enough to acknowledge the suffering of the families or to address their needs,” he said. “Families in Nepal are still waiting for answers 18 years after the end of the conflict.” This is the second time that an insurgency victim was allowed to speak before the UN Security Council, considered one of the most influential UN bodies. He said the families would like to remind states that they seek their continued support in mobilising the relevant authorities to find the “political will” and the needed resources so that families can find truth, answers, and justice. There is no sustainable peace without individual peace, he asserted. “We, families of missing people, would like to encourage states to adopt missing persons legislation and appropriate legal frameworks in all countries where missing persons are present,” he further said. Talking to the Post over the phone from New York, he said that addressing the UN Security Council was a great opportunity to remind the leadership from different countries, including Nepal, about the situation of conflict victims and these states’ obligation towards them. “Imagine surviving the horrors of a war, only for your father, mother, siblings or children to go missing. What happens to those who remain when a family member is lost, not to death or relocation but to an enforced disappearance or having gone missing? How do the people left behind cope with that tragedy and move on,” he said.Bhandari’s father, Tej Bahadur, a former teacher, was arrested from Besisahar, headquarters of Lamjung district, on December 31, 2001, during the state of emergency. He was detained by a joint team of security forces commanded by then Deputy Superintendent of Police Pitambar Adhikari, according to the complaint filed at the disappearance commission. Tej Bahadur was blindfolded, handcuffed, and tortured in the street before being taken into custody, and was never seen again. Like Bhandari, thousands of families of the victims of enforced disappearances and other human rights violations have continuously been fighting for justice for around two decades, but successive governments and political parties have paid little attention to justice delivery. Records at the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons show as many as 3,223 complaints of enforced disappearances implicating either security forces or the Maoists have been lodged at the commission. The commission has identified 2,494 cases falling under its jurisdiction for investigation. Similarly, 63,718 complaints have been registered with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Human rights defenders say a conflict victim demanding justice from the UN Security Council is a significant step. “Bhandari’s address will definitely build pressure to move the transitional justice process forward. His statement has been officially recorded,” Mohna Ansari, a former member of the National Human Rights Commission, told the Post. “It might not have immediate results, but Nepal might face questions at the UN forums like the Universal Periodic Review.”Nepal’s transitional justice process has been paralysed since July 2022, when the government decided to extend the terms of two commissions without retaining their chairpersons and members. Despite the government’s claim that the amendment bill to the Transitional Justice Act would be endorsed by October 2022, which would also open the door for recruiting new office bearers, there has been no progress in amending the Act.The major political parties, despite making several attempts, have been unable to find a meeting point on the bill though there has been some progress.After year-long discussions, the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives has narrowed down the differences in the bill. However, the House panel had been struggling to decide whether to categorise arbitrary killings or all killings except those that occurred in clashes as serious violations of human rights. It had also been unable to decide what happens in case the victims of human rights violations refuse to reconcile and demand punishment for the perpetrators. The Pushpa Kamal Dahal administration, through the national budget presented on May 28, has decided to set up a one-billion-rupee peace fund to provide relief and compensation to the victims. The government also has also announced to expedite the transitional justice process in the upcoming fiscal year. However, the bill has not been discussed since the formation of the UML-Maoist coalition on March 4. It is not known when the parliamentary committee will start discussing the amendment bill. Om Prakash Mishra, former Supreme Court chief justice, leads the committee formed to recommend the names of the office bearers of two commissions, but without the Act being amended, it has not commenced its work.Also addressing the UN Security Council, Lok Bahadur Thapa, Nepal’s permanent resident to the UN, said the country is committed to delivering justice to the victims by adopting its own homegrown and nationally-led process. “We have two transitional commissions to investigate the complaints.

A 2007 Human Rights Watch report on the “untouchables” of India observed, “The only parallel to the practice of untouchability was apartheid in South Africa.” The HRW has declared caste discrimination a form of “hidden apartheid”—an apt observation for Nepal as well.In the past years, caste hatred and exclusion have become more concealed yet pervasive in the Himalayan region; caste has also spread its tentacles in the global diaspora. Last month, Amnesty International criticised the government’s utter apathy and lack of accountability on the persistent plight of Dalits. The communist-populist alliance in government doesn’t seem to heed the call for change. This is clear from recently announced government policies, programmes and budgets for the fiscal year 2024-25. The authorities are bent on keeping caste hierarchy and untouchability sacred and solid. Budget for ‘Dalit skills’On March 21, 2022, attending a Dalit function in Kathmandu, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal declared that he was making a big announcement for the dignity and freedom of the “untouchables”. So much so that, he said, they would not forget it in over a century. He hasn’t made his supposedly phenomenal Dalit project explicit, but some Dalits still haven’t given up their hopes. Something came with this year’s budget for the Dalit community: Rs200 million to enhance Dalits’ traditional skills to create employment and promote their livelihood. This small yet seemingly significant budget has buoyed some Dalits. After all, as everybody says, something is better than nothing. However, I’m sceptical about the effectiveness of the Dalit-centred budget. Is it a big enough pot of money to significantly impact the target population? Most people would say “No”. Even some prominent Dalit NGO personalities close to the governing parties have expressed their dissatisfaction with the amount. Equally, are Dalits the only beneficiaries of this new scheme? I don't think so. The details of the intended 200-million project haven’t been developed yet. But it seems many non-Dalits will also get the support, especially those close to the ruling parties and leaders. There are at least two reasons for my understanding. First is the very name of the entity the government plans to establish to use that money: A separate body called the “Dalit, Neglected and Oppressed Class Upliftment and Development Corporation.” The use of so many words is likely intended to involve the beneficiaries from different castes and social groups. My suspicion stems from the second fact: In today’s Nepal, traditional Dalit skills—such as goldsmithing, tailoring, woodworking, and shoemaking—are no longer exclusively practised by Dalits. Once commercialised, many castes including the apex groups, have started these trades. So, skill enhancement projects will probably not be offered only to Dalits. I am not suggesting Dalits should have exclusive rights over these essential skills. It is neither practical nor proper to make such a case. My point is that it is probably wrong to think that the budget is for the betterment of Dalits. Untouched untouchabilityI have a serious objection to the utter lack of sensitivity towards the problems of Dalits, mainly the persistent practice of untouchability (hidden apartheid) in government policies, programmes and the budget. There is no single statement in the policies that mentions untouchability, let alone try to address it. The same applies to the state and local authorities under the federal system. The biggest irony is found in the Karnali Province, where the Province Head, Tilak Pariyar, is a Dalit man with a long history of fighting against the state as part of the Maoist movement, with ending caste oppression as a primary goal. On May 23, he presented 84-point policies and programmes of the province. Study it in detail, and aside from lip service here and there, there is no serious concern about the situation of Dalits in Karnali who have been facing caste humiliation and violence like nowhere else in the country. Yet the authorities seem totally blind to the realities! Recommended policy objectives What should a responsible government do, both in Kathmandu and Karnali? First, the federal capital should become sensitive towards the plight of Dalits, who suffer tremendously due to popular beliefs and practices of ritual impurity. Then, the federal capital should design a national policy framework that could be followed by the lower authorities.On a Sunday press meet, Caste Watch Network (CWN), a newly launched Dalit campaign group, recommended two fundamental policy objectives for tackling the complex problem of untouchability.First, the state should introduce new laws and policies—sticks and carrots—to enforce the constitutional and legal provisions against untouchability. It could, for example, forge a policy of immediately suspending government officials guilty of excluding and humiliating Dalits. Elderly people who discriminate against Dalits could be deprived of their elderly pensions for two years or so. Any temple practising Dalit exclusion could be deprived of state support in the form of money and sacred offerings and sacrificial animals (yes, even the historical and famous temples like Gorakhkali and Manakamana do practise a form of social exclusion). The second important policy objective would be to reform the religion. Some people frown at my suggestions about initiating religious and cultural reform, which they think takes many decades, if not centuries.While we cannot easily rewrite casteist texts like Manusmriti and Parasaramriti, it is possible to achieve the reformation of some religious beliefs and practices over time. For that, the secular state should stand firm against religious dogma and formulate proper laws and implement them. If no religious and/or cultural reform were possible at all, we would still be burning our mothers and sisters and other women alive on the sati pyres. If reform weren’t possible, we wouldn’t see a section of Bahuns drinking alcohol and consuming pork, and, as alluded to earlier, engaging in tailoring, drumming, shoemaking and goldsmithing. Upper castes have deceived Dalits. They have forced religious and cultural transformations in areas that benefit them materially and in other ways. And they have been opposed to the reform of those areas of religious and cultural traditions that would ensure equal rights for Dalits. For example, a Bahun doesn’t become polluted by drinking and drumming; these transgressions do not anger his deities. But he thinks he and his family, lineage and other deities and spirits become polluted if a drummer enters his house. Religious-cultural reform is not as tough as it seems. Governments and authorities at all levels should introduce new laws and policies and spend large sums to change the spiritual, religious and cultural spheres. Without this, we cannot do away with untouchability.

Art is both the most accessible and spiritual form of an archive, distinct from academic records. It is because, unlike other forms of archives, art captures both the profound and the mundane, even when they lie in striking juxtaposition. It embodies emotions and experiences too complex for words, nurturing the drive in artists of different eras to innovate beyond conventional forms of expression and mediums.The most recent art exhibition at Gallery Mcube’s ‘Young Artists Show’ features ten young artists’ expressions of love, angst, and struggle for the world around them all within one space. This exhibition features stunning, inventive, and evocative artworks that explore a wide range of subjects and emotions. The artworks represent a diverse group of young artists from various parts of Nepal.Harshita Singh’s artwork is the first thing you see as you enter the space. It incorporates her pottery practice and her fascination with the concept of ‘Hamsa’, which represents hands. Her creation is both original and compelling. I found myself staring at artwork for extended periods, trying to unravel its meanings and the artistic processes behind it.Subodh Bhandari and Sambrididhi R Shakya’s ‘What Makes a City’ deserve a larger and extended exhibition because of the issues it raises. This intricate mixed-media features layers of symbolism that will engage art enthusiasts and amateurs alike. With a specific focus on Kathmandu, these works explore the essence of urban life and the difficulties faced by cities, employing materials like plastic sacks, glass, intricate paintwork, and calligraphy.These artworks address Kathmandu’s waste management issues and water scarcity with sensitivity and insight. They also shed light on Nepal’s brain drain problem, highlighting its impact on the city and its inhabitants. Overall, ‘What Makes a City’ by Subodh Bhandari and Sambrididhi R Shakya not only showcases their artistic prowess but also raises important social and environmental issues in a visually compelling and thought-provoking way.As I walked through the exhibition, I came across feathers painted with detailed, lifelike images of different birds hovering around a levitating tree branch in an enthralling spectacle. More feathers scattered all over the floor, each one intricately painted with bird art. I found the concept to be both captivating and innovative, pushing the boundaries of artistic expression with daring experimentation.

Why can’t we be honest about them? Especially moms. They’re the most romanticised of anyone.”One rarely comes across a book titled ‘I’m Glad My Mom Died’. My first thought after stumbling onto this literary piece was what possibly could have been the author’s grudge towards her mother for naming the book with such an abrasive title. And quite fittingly, the title has made its mark by drawing attention from readers worldwide, making the book a New York Times bestseller. American writer, filmmaker, former actress, and singer Jennette McCurdy has created a stir in the literary scene with her debut book, ‘I’m glad my mom died’. The book’s main theme revolves around the complicated relationship between the author and her mother. The book also explores other themes such as abuse, child stardom and exploitation, eating disorders, grief and healing, and finally, resilience and survival. The memoir opens with the celebration of McCurdy’s sixth birthday when her mom presents her with a two-piece outfit surrounded by daisies. McCurdy throws on her best fake smile and exclaims it to be her favourite birthday gift ever. This particular event prods the readers to be cautious about the series of events that will unfold, hinting at the complex and often painful dynamics of her relationship with her mother that are to be revealed throughout the narrative.The general perception regarding abuse tends to focus primarily on physical violence overlooking other forms, such as emotional and psychological abuse. McCurdy, in her memoir, chronicles the continuum of emotional and psychological abuse she had to face throughout her childhood at the hands of her mother. Just like any other helicopter parent, McCurdy’s mother projects her unmet aspiration of becoming an actor to her daughter. She then continues to micromanage every aspect of McCurdy’s life, often pressuring her to achieve the dream that she once harboured. The authoritarian demeanour of the mother leaves McCurdy to develop OCD from a young age which she refers to as the “Holy Ghost”. Due to her age, she isn’t fully aware of how harmful the condition she was diagnosed with can be. Instead, she is thrilled to have conversations with the “Holy Ghost” where she says, “I can talk to the holy ghost whenever I want to, and he can talk to me, guiding me to do what is right, which is whatever he tells me to do. I am so lucky”. As the memoir continues, the readers find that the mother uses McCurdy’s fame to pay their bills, often flaunting her daughter’s success to maintain her unattained lifestyle. McCurdy’s struggle to make her mother understand her aspiration to become a writer instead of an actor is similar to the struggle of the character Farhan in the Bollywood hit ‘3 Idiots’, where, at last, the orthodox father finally lets his son pursue his interest of becoming a photographer. However, in McCurdy’s case, her mother is dismissive of her daughter’s ambition and instead tries to manipulate her daughter by saying, “Writer’s dress is frumpy and fat. I would never want your little actress’s peach butt to turn into a big, giant writer’s watermelon butt.”The emotional quandary of McCurdy’s is further complicated when her mother gets diagnosed with breast cancer. The mother’s manipulative behaviour leads her to make her children watch the video of her cancer diagnosis time and again until her children take it to blame themselves for the cause of their mother’s cancer. Ultimately, McCurdy considers it her job to save her mother from mortal sickness as cancer. She tries every rule in the book to get validation from her mother to the extent that she hides her preferred colour, purple, just because her mother prefers pink.The situation worsens when even after having reached the age of 16, the mother thinks it is a good idea to let her son and daughter shower in the same bathroom.Similarly, she puts McCurdy on a strict diet plan of calorie restriction. She is even made to read every diet-related book even before she gets her menstruation. The memoir is divided into two parts, i.e. before and after. ‘Before’ chronicles McCurdy’s experience with her abusive mother, whereas ‘After’ poignantly describes the harrowing effect of bulimia as a result of her mother’s years of abuse. The book also focuses on the ethical and developmental concerns of exposing a child to the limelight from a young age through McCurdy’s personal experience in the Hollywood industry. It also highlights the damage the entertainment industry can do to a child’s mental and emotional well-being.The book shines in its execution, particularly in addressing the question, “What does grief look like when you don’t share a great relationship with your loved one?” This question ties seamlessly into the title, as McCurdy struggles to recognise and cope with her emotions following her mother’s death. The universal practice of idolising one’s mother makes it difficult for her to acknowledge the abuse she endured during childhood—adding layers to her grief and healing process. Despite being a candid account of McCurdy’s experience with abuse, the nature of the memoir can resonate with Nepali readers. It mirrors the stark reality of Nepali households, where children often bear the burden of their parents’ unfulfilled dreams of securing a stable job. This restricts them from following their desire when it comes to careers. The memoir plays its part in demonstrating that fame is not everything; it is frequently nothing at all. It urges its readers to see the thin line that demarcates the life of an ordinary person and a celebrity. However, underneath the line lies a shared humanity that transcends fame and fortune, reminding us that our intrinsic value is not defined by external measures of success.The memoir should come with a trigger warning because its graphic narration of emotional abuse might make readers uncomfortable. This disrupted the linear flow of my reading experience, making it difficult to progress through the book. However, the author’s touch of sarcasm creates an engaging authorial voice. Destined to become an actor yet a natural when it comes to writing, McCurdy has set the train in motion through her candid yet moving writing. She accurately describes the mental state of her formative years, which skillfully captures the emotions she wishes to convey. The memoir ends on a hopeful note as McCurdy affirms, “Mom didn’t get better.

Why are the leaders of the fourth-largest party in the House of Representatives and the third-largest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Cabinet giving statements hinting at their possible exit from the government?Some remarks made by the RSP ministers have fuelled speculation. On Saturday, Minister for Youth and Sports Biraj Bhakta Shrestha of the same party remarked that the time has come to review their participation in the government and its support to the coalition. Addressing a function organised to mark the establishment day of the RSP, he went on to say that they were ready to quit the government if needed. “We are always carrying our resignation letter in our pocket, and the paper may be pulled out any time,” he said. On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane, who is also the RSP president, complained that though they were in the government, others were controlling state power in a true sense. Many wondered if Lamichhane had started getting frustrated with the government.Addressing a press briefing organised on the occasion of Lamichhane’s 100 days in the home ministry, he said, “Though we are in government, we don’t know who is exercising the state power. Power has been controlled by some others for a long time, and it is a bit difficult to break that nexus.” However, some lawmakers from the party the Post spoke to voiced ignorance of why the party’s ministers were making such remarks. The RSP put on an impressive performance at the 2022 election, capitalising on the public’s frustration with traditional parties. Minister Shrestha said they were treading a tough path and were ready to quit the government if they were coerced into making unnecessary compromises.Shrestha said that after they joined the government, they realised that the country’s misgovernance was more serious than prevailing social malpractices. In the last week of December in 2022, Dahal became prime minister for the third time with the support of the CPN-UML and the RSP, among other parties. Dahal later ditched them and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new Cabinet.After 14 months, Dahal sent the Nepali Congress out of power and brought the UML and the RSP into the coalition on March 4 this year. Hundred days after the latest change in the power equation, statements from the leaders and ministers of the third-largest coalition partner have made watchers curious about their intentions. Asked what was going on inside their party, RSP lawmakers expressed their ignorance. They said they had no idea about the party’s future moves and leaders’ mood as there had not been enough meetings, discussions, and interactions recently.“We would know what is going on in the party and the government only if there were party meetings,” the lawmakers told the Post asking not to be named. “Only a select group of leaders make party’s decisions, and we are kept in the dark.” Kabindra Burlakoti, the party's deputy general secretary, however, tried to downplay Shrestha's statement as generic. He said Saturday’s statement by the minister is nothing different from the ones party leaders have been saying since joining the government. His statement does not imply that the party is seeking to recall its ministers, added Burlakoti. “Until our party has a free hand to work in the government, we are not considering withdrawing our support,” Burlakoti told the Post.Experts, however, say Lamichhane is trying to cover up his failure to deliver. The party that rose with tall promises made during the election campaign is failing to live up to its pledges. It has courted controversy in multiple cases, including the cooperative scam.“The party has a free hand in the government,” Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, told the Post. “I see no reason for the party to blame its coalition partners.”After the Ilam-2 by-election on April 27, RSP General Secretary Mukul Dhakal travelled to various places to study the reasons for the party’s defeat in the bypolls.During the general secretary's visit to various districts, well-wishers shared their advice that it would have been better had the party focused on organisation-building rather than joining the government, deputy general secretary Burlakoti said.“However, the party is not considering a radical move immediately,” Burlakoti added. “The advice given to our general secretary during his nationwide tour was received as feedback. The party is in no mood to quit the government.”Experts, however, say RSP leaders might be anxious about the report and recommendations of the parliamentary probe committee formed to investigate the cooperative scam. Lamichhane has been accused of embezzling millions of rupees from various cooperatives when he managed the now shuttered television Galaxy 4K.The parliamentary committee has been mandated to figure out if the cooperative money was rerouted to the Gorkha Media Network. Lamichhane was the managing director of the media company that operated the television.“Anticipating the possible outcome of the probe, the RSP could have started to bargain with ruling partners,” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, told the Post. “They might have tried to use the situation to win public sentiment.”But Burlakoti denied such a possibility. “We are confident that our party president won’t be implicated by the probe,’’ he said. “Then there is no question our party leaders should be bargaining with the coalition partners.” ","summary":"What’s cooking in the Rastriya Swatantra Party?

On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane, who is also the RSP president, complained that though they were in the government, others were controlling state power in a true sense. Many wondered if Lamichhane had started getting frustrated with the government.Addressing a press briefing organised on the occasion of Lamichhane’s 100 days in the home ministry, he said, “Though we are in government, we don’t know who is exercising the state power. Power has been controlled by some others for a long time, and it is a bit difficult to break that nexus.” However, some lawmakers from the party the Post spoke to voiced ignorance of why the party’s ministers were making such remarks. The RSP put on an impressive performance at the 2022 election, capitalising on the public’s frustration with traditional parties. Minister Shrestha said they were treading a tough path and were ready to quit the government if they were coerced into making unnecessary compromises.Shrestha said that after they joined the government, they realised that the country’s misgovernance was more serious than prevailing social malpractices. In the last week of December in 2022, Dahal became prime minister for the third time with the support of the CPN-UML and the RSP, among other parties. Dahal later ditched them and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new Cabinet.After 14 months, Dahal sent the Nepali Congress out of power and brought the UML and the RSP into the coalition on March 4 this year. Hundred days after the latest change in the power equation, statements from the leaders and ministers of the third-largest coalition partner have made watchers curious about their intentions. Asked what was going on inside their party, RSP lawmakers expressed their ignorance. They said they had no idea about the party’s future moves and leaders’ mood as there had not been enough meetings, discussions, and interactions recently.“We would know what is going on in the party and the government only if there were party meetings,” the lawmakers told the Post asking not to be named. “Only a select group of leaders make party’s decisions, and we are kept in the dark.” Kabindra Burlakoti, the party's deputy general secretary, however, tried to downplay Shrestha's statement as generic. He said Saturday’s statement by the minister is nothing different from the ones party leaders have been saying since joining the government. His statement does not imply that the party is seeking to recall its ministers, added Burlakoti. “Until our party has a free hand to work in the government, we are not considering withdrawing our support,” Burlakoti told the Post.Experts, however, say Lamichhane is trying to cover up his failure to deliver. The party that rose with tall promises made during the election campaign is failing to live up to its pledges. It has courted controversy in multiple cases, including the cooperative scam.“The party has a free hand in the government,” Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, told the Post. “I see no reason for the party to blame its coalition partners.”After the Ilam-2 by-election on April 27, RSP General Secretary Mukul Dhakal travelled to various places to study the reasons for the party’s defeat in the bypolls.During the general secretary's visit to various districts, well-wishers shared their advice that it would have been better had the party focused on organisation-building rather than joining the government, deputy general secretary Burlakoti said.“However, the party is not considering a radical move immediately,” Burlakoti added. “The advice given to our general secretary during his nationwide tour was received as feedback. The party is in no mood to quit the government.”Experts, however, say RSP leaders might be anxious about the report and recommendations of the parliamentary probe committee formed to investigate the cooperative scam. Lamichhane has been accused of embezzling millions of rupees from various cooperatives when he managed the now shuttered television Galaxy 4K.The parliamentary committee has been mandated to figure out if the cooperative money was rerouted to the Gorkha Media Network. Lamichhane was the managing director of the media company that operated the television.“Anticipating the possible outcome of the probe, the RSP could have started to bargain with ruling partners,” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, told the Post. “They might have tried to use the situation to win public sentiment.”But Burlakoti denied such a possibility. “We are confident that our party president won’t be implicated by the probe,’’ he said. “Then there is no question our party leaders should be bargaining with the coalition partners.” "},{"hash":"ab73922f64f50e3689ed0e3371e555839bafe64966f2a58755df5345aee5e1c5","title":"ruling-party-chief-oli-again-vents-ire-at-budget","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/06/16/ruling-party-chief-oli-again-vents-ire-at-budget","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/oli-1718513575.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1718496000000,"source":"kp","category":"politics","content":"CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli once again vented his ire at the budget for the new fiscal year on Saturday, fuelling speculations of growing discord among the ruling parties.On May 29, the day after Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun read out the national budget in Parliament, Oli lambasted some of the provisions and said the fiscal plan was of “one minister and one party”.Oli and his party were unhappy with some of the provisions, including the distribution of funds to the conflict victims, who mostly are CPN (Maoist Centre) members.

The ministry has sought information on the teachers and professors affiliated to the parties from the Election Commission and the respective district education units.The initiative was taken as per the Political Parties Act, 2017 which prohibits the teachers, professors and other government employees from engaging in politics. Similarly, the Patan High Court on October 5, 2021 had ruled that school teachers cannot engage in active politics. Responding to a writ petition, the court said those drawing salaries and benefits from the state coffers should not be involved in partisan politics. The major parties have disapproved of Shrestha’s move as a large number of teachers are their cadres. For instance, as many as 263 of the 4,743 representatives to the Nepali Congress general convention held in December 2021 were school teachers and staff. The number is above five percent of the total delegates.The main opposition CPN-UML also had dozens of teachers as representatives in its 10th general congress held in November that year. Hundreds of school teachers are associated with the CPN (Maoist Centre) as well.Leaders from all these parties have criticised the move directly or indirectly. Speaking in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, Maoist Centre Secretary Devendra Paudel said the principals of many best-performing community schools were affiliated to different parties.“It is unnecessary to test teachers’ DNA.

The government was under the pressure of private schools to keep the report a secret as it envisions converting the schools registered as companies into trusts within 10 years. Converting the existing schools into trusts would mean they will be barred from taking profits home. Several cross-party leaders have investments in private schools.Oli was so annoyed by Minister Shrestha’s decision to make the report public that he resorted to making personal remarks about her nationality and marital status without naming her.Now the teachers’ unions of various parties have united against her. The ministry on May 27 endorsed a directive guiding teachers’ transfers. The directive came amid allegations that teachers are being transferred without fulfilling the due procedure. The directive is accused of encroaching on the authority of the School Management Committee and increasing the ministry’s role in transfers. “Your good education is meaningless if you are doing more harm than good to the education sector,” said Shankar Adhikari, chair of the teacher association close to the Maoist Centre, referring to Shrestha’s foreign degree. “She has a shallow understanding of Nepal's education sector.”Leaders of other teacher associations have asked the minister to reverse the directive, warning of the consequences of not doing so. “The directive was issued with the mala fide intent of troubling teachers. This is unacceptable,” said Gyanedra Rawal of the Nepal Teachers’ Union, the Congress teachers’ wing.Some lawmakers and education experts, however, have supported minister Shrestha, saying she is on the right track to improve the country's education sector. Addressing the lower house meeting on Wednesday, independent lawmaker Amresh Kumar Singh said he fully supports the education minister, who is making the necessary intervention. “The education minister is taking the right course.

The court asked the commission and other authorities to put the process on hold, and the case is still sub judice. When the court gives a verdict on the issue, the JSP-Nepal's fence-sitters may decide whether to remain with the party or defect to the new outfit.Just a week before the unity general convention, the party suffered another setback as it had to give up the chief minister’s post in Madhesh Province when the erstwhile coalition partners–the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre)—withdrew their support to the government. During the floor test held on June 5 JSP-Nepal lawmaker Saroj Kumar Yadav, the immediate past chief minister of the province, fell 4 votes short from securing the position. When he garnered 50 votes in support, 53 members voted against him. In the 107-strong assembly, the chief minister has to secure at least 54 votes in support.Upendra Yadav's parties, including the current JSP-Nepal, continuously led the provincial government for almost seven years until Satish Kumar Singh of the Janamat Party dethroned Yadav’s party from the chief ministerial position on June 7.Though the recent party split and the dethroning of the Madhesh Province’s leadership can be blamed on the party leadership, according to analysts, the unity general convention poses little challenge to Yadav. Because of the split, there are no leaders left in the party who’d challenge Yadav, Chandra Kishore, an observer of Madhesh politics, told the Post. “Therefore, the general convention should be a walk in the park for him.” The party that held its statute convention last year adopted a policy of lobbying for a directly elected presidential system in the country. Likewise, the Madhesh-based party set the goal of fighting for a parliament with fully proportional representation. This is expected to direct policy at the unity convention. However, experts question the sustainability of the policies adopted by the statute convention in the party's post-split situation.“The policies adopted by the statute convention will remain intact,” Prakash Adhikari, a federal lawmaker of the party, told the Post. “The party division, which is sub judice in the Supreme Court, will not impact policy changes.”Chandra Kishore, who has been following Madhesh politics for a long time, differs from Adhikari.“Yadav is a political strategist. He acts as per the situation,” he said. “He will not necessarily act as per the party documents.” The JSP-Nepal’s central committee in January, two months before the split, decided to hold the unity general convention in June. The party decided to organise the convention in order to consolidate the unity between various Madhes-based parties over time, party leaders said.This is the first unity convention held after the merger of various Madhes-based parties, Manish Kumar Suman, spokesperson for the JSP-Nepal, told the Post.The Tarai Madhesh Loktantrik Party, led by Mahantha Thakur; the Rastriya Madhesh Samajbadi Party, led by Sarat Singh Bhandari; the Tarai Madhesh Sadbhawana Party, led by Mahendra Yadav’ the Sadbhawana Party, led by Rajendra Mahato; the Madheshi Janadhikar Ganatantrik Party, led by Raj Kishor Yadav; and Anil Jha’s Nepal Sadbhawana Party merged to form the Rastriya Janata Party before the 2017 general and provincial elections.The Rastriya Janata Party and the Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party led by Upendra Yadav fought the 2017 elections with a tie-up in Madhesh but merged the parties in 2020 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party. When the erstwhile prime minister KP Sharma Oli issued an ordinance to split the Yadav-led party to counterbalance a rift within his Nepal Communist Party (NCP) formed after the merger of the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) following the 2017 election, the merger in the two Madhesh-based parties was hastened. Before this, the only Madheshi party to hold the general convention periodically was the Nepal Sadbhawana Party. Gajendra Narayan Singh, who formed the Nepal Sadbhabana Council in 1985, turned the council into a party following the first people’s movement of 1990.Yadav’s will be another Madhesh-based party to hold the general convention more than once, Suman said.Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates a political party to hold its general convention at least once in five years. However, if the office bearers cannot be elected in five years due to a situation arising out of special circumstances, based on the statute of a political party, new leaders can be elected within six months thereafter. The constitutional time frame is not mandatory for a new party or one formed after a split. As Nepal’s regional parties often suffer splits, they rarely hold the general convention periodically.The Upendra Yadav-led Madheshi Janadhikar Forum (MJF) held its second convention in 2009, in Birgunj, just after the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. The MJF was a rights-based organisation before it entered politics after the first Madhesh uprising of 2007. JSP-Nepal spokesperson Suman said Yadav has led various political parties, but this is the second time an outfit he leads is holding the general convention.The Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar-led Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (Loktantrik) held its first general convention in Biratnagar in May 2016. The same year, Nepal Sadbhawana Party also held its general conventions in April.The JSP-Nepal has invited foreign dignitaries to the unity convention.

Hundreds of people suffered from diarrheal infections that continued for months.Experts say an outbreak of cholera in Kathmandu Valley before the onset of the monsoon is concerning, as rainwater contaminates most water resources, increasing the risk of more people getting infected from water-borne diseases including cholera. “More people could have been infected with cholera, as not all cases become severe and not all patients do not go to the hospital for treatment,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical research unit at the Sukraraj Hospital. “Many patients buy medicines from nearby pharmacies to recover at home. Only serious cases end up in hospitals.”Meanwhile, officials at the Health Office Kathmandu said that they are unaware of any confirmed cholera cases in the district. “We don’t have information about a cholera outbreak in recent days,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office in Kathmandu. “We are the agency responsible for investigating the causes of outbreaks of deadly diseases, and as of today (Friday) we don’t have such information.”Sapkota informed that one case of cholera infection was reported from Sitapaila in Kathmandu about three months ago.

However, most districts in the country have already reported outbreaks of the deadly disease even before the onset of monsoon.Public health experts have warned of a massive outbreak of the potentially deadly virus in the coming days, as the monsoon is just around the corner, and authorities are not doing much to prevent outbreaks.“Except counting the number of infected people and releasing statements, not much of substance is being done,” said Dr Baburam Gautam, a public health expert. “The general public has stopped taking such statements on dengue infection seriously.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,105 people from 69 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 69 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 112. Jhapa district recorded 109 cases, followed by Chitwan (73), Makwanpur (58), Sindhupalchok (44), Tanahun (39), Okhaldhunga (38), Doti (30), Rupandehi (28), and Bhaktapur (27). The three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur—together reported 157 cases of infections in this period.Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa, and Kalikot are among the mountain districts that have reported dengue cases.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Post-monsoon is considered a highly transmissible season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease around the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Experts say this is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks.Waiting for a massive outbreak would be a big mistake, they say. To reduce the risk, authorities should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance, and take other measures. Health ministry officials said that they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.“Even if massive outbreaks have not been seen in any place, many districts have already reported dengue cases,” said Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “We have alerted all relevant agencies to the risk of an outbreak in the coming days.”Authorities and agencies in some local units have launched activities to raise residents' awareness of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, Dahal said.Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities do not take it seriously. They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients having these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.

On Tuesday, Dhangadhi recorded 40.4 degrees Celsius, Nepalgunj 40.2 degrees Celsius and Birendranagar 37.3 degrees Celsius, the Met office’s data shows.Met officials anticipate monsoon will start at the end of next week and bring respite from scorching heat.Over 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 are being inoculated with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in a nationwide immunisation drive started on May 26.Officials said that children who missed the IPV vaccine during the routine immunisation programme will be administered the vaccine, as they are at risk of getting infected with Type-2 polio.Gautam said that vaccination programmes are being carried out smoothly in the rest of the places. The vaccine is being administered in schools, booths and health posts.Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but the World Health Organisation officially declared it polio-free on March 27, 2014 after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV).The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus.The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus.However, the Type -2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in the South Asia region to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN Health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Gautam said that due to global shortages of the IPV vaccine, children born between April 13, 2016, and October 18, 2018 were inoculated only with the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine.“Children who missed the IPV vaccine will be at high risk of poliovirus infection,” Gautam said. “So we are launching a campaign to inoculate them.”Health officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.Childhood immunisation is the number one priority of the government, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, however, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all.This figure was one percent in 2016.The Ministry of Health and Population said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country.

Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility.

","summary":"Celeus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility.

They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley "},{"hash":"c077b34beda2250a997231f215f178053a057340c5c72de0aec15b25ae40ddb7","title":"old-memories-and-new-realities-in-phidim","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/travel/2023/11/18/old-memories-and-new-realities-in-phidim","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2023/third-party/phidim%20main%20(1).JPG&w=900&height=601","date":1700265600000,"source":"kp","category":"travel","content":"Once again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it.

During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time.

It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides.

Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides.

Keep your heads high,” world cricket governing body International Cricket Council wrote on X, formerly Twitter.South Africa legend Dale Steyn called the Nepal vs South Africa game the “Match of the Tournament” on ICC’s Digital Daily show.“It would’ve been the talk of the tournament if Nepal would’ve gotten over the line. It would’ve been fantastic, and they deserved to win,” Steyn said. “[This was] the match of the tournament to be honest with you.

That was South Africa you almost took down today. You have some of the most passionate fans and you let them believe. Hopefully bigger days are round the corner.”Indian Premier League franchise cricket team Chennai Super Kings wrote on X: “Unreal fans support! Unreal game of unreal night! Nepal, you have won all our hearts!”“Nepal's performance—all cricketing commentators, most of the IPL franchise teams, cricketing bodies are talking about the team, talking about that fan following!” a Nepal supporter based in Australia wrote on X. “Isn't it great? Didn't we win something?”ICC and Asian Cricket Council commentator Mikkhail Vaswani wrote on his Facebook page: “Nepal are the youngest team in this World Cup. They have put on some great performances. Time to back the boys for a very strong and committed effort.”At an average age of 23.7, Nepal are the youngest team at the World Cup. The team is led by Rohit Paudel, who, at 21, is the youngest captain in the 20-team tournament, while Gulsan Jha, 18, is the youngest player.After the match, Paudel stressed that Nepal needed more exposure against the best teams of the world if they are to be on the right side of the result.“We were very close but a little far,” Paudel said after the close contest. “In crunch moments, we did well, the way we fought was very good.”He added, “If we get more exposure regularly, then next games we will be on the other side [of the result].”Nepal were a far less experienced side as they were making their only second appearance at the world stage.Chasing, the batters took Nepal to 85-2 in the 14th over in the chase, riding on 32 runs from their power play without losing a wicket and a half-century stand between opener Aasif Sheikh and Anil Sah that came off just 36 deliveries.But the introduction of spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (4-19) would prove to be lethal in Nepal’s chase.Shamsi first dismissed Bhurtel for 13 with his only second delivery in the eighth over and Paudel for a duck two balls later to hurl South Africa back in the game.Sheikh and Sah rebuilt the Nepal innings.Sah hit three boundaries off Anrich Nortje and a six off Shamshi to raise the tempo before Sheikh smashed Kagiso Rabada for a four and a six that took Nepal past 80 total after 13 overs with still eight wickets in hand.After Sah fell to Aiden Markram (1-8) making 27 runs off 24 balls, Sheikh and Airee dragged Nepal to 98-3 from 17 overs.But Shamshi returned with the ball in the 18th over and mercilessly raided the stumps of Airee and dangerman Sheikh to turn the game back into South Africa’s favour. Sheikh finished his innings with 42 runs off 49 balls.Nepal needed 16 runs off the last 12 balls but Nortje (1-27) and Ottneil Baartman held their nerves in the final two overs to save the Proteas from the jaws of defeat.Nortje bowled four dots in the penultimate over including a wicket of Kushal Malla that left Nepal requiring 16 runs off the last eight balls.Sompal Kami hit Nortje with a long six and collected two runs off the last ball of the 19th over that brought the equation down to eight off the final six deliveries. Gulsan Jha next cracked a four off Baartman in the 19.3 overs and managed another two off the next delivery to inch Nepal closer to overhauling the target.Nepal only needed two runs off the last two deliveries to keep alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight but Baartman threw two dots with perfect bouncers to break Nepali hearts.Gulsan Jha tried to take the game to Super Over with a desperate attempt to add a run off a bye of the final delivery but Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen combined to run him out at the non-striker’s end.Earlier, Bhurtel took 4-19 and Airee bowled 3-21 to trouble South Africa throughout the innings.South Africa added 22 runs for the first wicket before Airee got the breakthrough wicket when he caught and bowled de Kock for 10 in the fourth over.Bhurtel then bowled captain Markram for 15 in the 12th over, ending their 46-run stand for the second wicket.South Africa seemed headed for a good total when they were at 68-2 in the 12th over but Bhurtel’s wrist spin and Airee’s off break kept their powerful opponents under control.Bhurtel removed Klaasen for three before Airee got the big fish Hendricks, who top scored for South Africa with 43 runs off 49 balls, and removed David Miller for seven the next.South Africa needed sixth number batter Tristan Stubbs’s 27 not out off 18 balls for a boost to their innings.Bhurtel then underlined Nepal’s impressive bowling, claiming the wickets of Marco Jansen (1) and Rabada (0) in successive deliveries off the final two balls.Sandeep Lamichhane also started for the first time after missing Nepal’s matches in the United States due to visa issues and bowled splendidly conceding only 18 runs in his four-over spell.“I am very proud of the unit, especially the way we bowled and batted, I'm very proud of that,” Paudel said.South Africa skipper Markram was also full of praise for Nepal’s bowling.“First and foremost, the way [Nepal] bowled it made it really tough for us. They put us under a lot of pressure,” Markram said.The defeat leaves Nepal fourth in the five-team group D with one point, which they earned after rain washed out their second group match against Sri Lanka. Nepal had lost their opening game to the Netherlands by six wickets.South Africa, who had already progressed to the Super Eight round, finished the group stage unbeaten, collecting eight points from four matches.Nepal next face Bangladesh on Monday and will look to end their T20 World Cup campaign on a high note.Bangladesh are second with four points from three matches and a victory over Nepal would secure them a spot in the next round.The Netherlands, on two points, are also in contention and next face Sri Lanka who are also without a win and lie at the bottom of the group.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

Take, for example, the recent directive by Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane to deploy traffic rule violators for traffic management. Thankfully, Lamichhane’s directive was overturned by the Supreme Court. The Kathmandu Road Division’s hasty decision to blacktop the road section the Kathmandu Metropolitan City had prepared for footpath extension is another example.It is striking how Lamichhane—a journalist-turned-politician and a former vocal critic of the ministers from parties he now aligns with—turned out no different. He is just as unscrupulous and power-hungry as the old guard, doing everything he can to remain in power and satisfy his political ambitions. Such a hunger for power leads him to make hasty and moody decisions, further augmenting the burden on the economy and society. This piece will analyse the economic cost of such decisions later, but first, let’s understand the reasons behind the pomposity of the leaders. One must understand political schooling to understand why Nepali politicians, new and old, formulate bizarre policies. What are the qualifications to become a politician, let alone a minister, in Nepal? It is anything but education and expertise. The current federal Cabinet of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and state and local level governments are not far from any of this. Most of them are no experts, nor do they hold the required knowledge to run their positions. The irony is that we have a government where a journalist becomes the home minister, a former rebel commander becomes the finance minister, and someone who lost the election becomes the minister of foreign affairs, home affairs, and physical infrastructure and transportation, all within a year under the same prime ministership. How can one person seamlessly transition between ministries overnight and suddenly become an expert in each field? ConsequencesThe lack of proper education and thorough understanding of the policymakers’ responsibilities is causing serious problems at the policy level. This is the main reason for their narrow-mindedness—their inability to accept diversity and expert opinions—and to understand complex social and economic phenomena, which leads them to have a “holier-than-thou” and “I am the law” attitude. Huge economic costs and unnecessary social burdens come with that. Every economic policy comes with economic and social costs. Economic costs are of two types: Direct costs and opportunity costs. Direct costs are the actual tangible expenditures associated with implementing a policy and can be easily measured. Opportunity costs are implicit and come with forgone policy alternatives. These are difficult to measure, yet are crucial for policy evaluation, as they directly affect overall output or the economy. For example, had the home minister's recent ruling not been halted by the Supreme Court, it would have cost the nation an estimated Rs250 million a year. This calculation is based on the daily productivity of an individual ($1434/365) at the current exchange rate (Rs133.25/USD) and 1,300 incidences per day. The recent impulsive decision by the Road Department, under Raghuvir Mahaseth, to blacktop a section of the New Road, led to financial costs. If the minister were concerned about the people and the economy, he would have worked to speed up the construction of the remaining section of the Ring Road, which has far more important economic, social, and health and environmental concerns. As a result of these difficulties, households are bearing extra social costs, and the retail and service economies are losing productivity in the area due to a lack of proper infrastructure and environmental quality. Further, this will only increase the cost of production over time and reduce the country’s output because of fewer economic activities. Similarly, the former finance minister Janardan Sharma’s controversial tax policy and the current finance minister Barsha Man Pun's ineffective policy of distributing the budget for their cadres through popular programmes such as the Prime Minister Daughter Resilient Programme—when similar programmes like former PM KP Oli’s Prime Minister Employment Programme turned into white elephants—will add further burden. The inconsistency in the government’s policies, such as reducing tax last year and increasing this year on electric vehicles, shows a lack of understanding of the matter. These are just a few examples of irrational and farfetched laws and policies of the past and incumbent governments. The politicians’ behaviours and self-righteous actions put a huge economic, social and environmental toll on the nation. Additionally, policies that lead to the depletion of natural resources and allocation of public property to private politicians’ cronies result from the irresponsibility of the leaders. Not to forget, the decisions of the former government led by KP Oli to allow the commercialisation and export of natural resources from the Chure region and swap the land of the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate are no less concerning. There should be stringent mechanisms to control politicians’ reckless decisions. Though the Supreme Court has been overturning such steps, self-fulfilling politicians like those in the current and past governments remain a nuisance. Politicians must be made responsible for their deeds, even if they do not trigger corruption cases. Publicising cost-benefit analysis before formulating any such policies and regulations should be made mandatory. Otherwise, no matter whether the old or the new leaders make it to the government with their chicaneries, Nepal will continue to bear economic, social and environmental costs.

Additionally, policies that lead to the depletion of natural resources and allocation of public property to private politicians’ cronies result from the irresponsibility of the leaders. Not to forget, the decisions of the former government led by KP Oli to allow the commercialisation and export of natural resources from the Chure region and swap the land of the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate are no less concerning. There should be stringent mechanisms to control politicians’ reckless decisions. Though the Supreme Court has been overturning such steps, self-fulfilling politicians like those in the current and past governments remain a nuisance. Politicians must be made responsible for their deeds, even if they do not trigger corruption cases. Publicising cost-benefit analysis before formulating any such policies and regulations should be made mandatory. Otherwise, no matter whether the old or the new leaders make it to the government with their chicaneries, Nepal will continue to bear economic, social and environmental costs.

But first, some introductions.Ever since I can remember, playing and watching cricket have been important parts of my identity. I have followed with joy the rise of Nepali cricket over the last 20 years. I am what you might call a fanatic. I never miss any Nepal match if I can help it, be it a friendly with a local club in India, a crunch qualifier against one of our nemesis associate nations, or a World Cup match against a Test nation. It does not matter what time zone a match is being played or where I am. I have also followed Sandeep Lamichhane’s career closely. He put Nepali cricket on the international map, and whether he played for the national team or some local T20 franchise, I tried to find a working link to be able to watch him play.I am establishing these credentials first because I expect fellow passionate Nepali cricket fans will rush to dismiss what comes next. But I want you to know that I love Nepali cricket just as much as you do, and so this is not part of some conspiracy to discredit Sandeep or Nepali cricket. Quite the opposite: I care about Nepali cricket too much to stay silent. At a time when populist stunts are rife, it feels necessary to speak truth to power, as an expression of love. Custodians of rape cultureMuch has been written about Sandeep’s Gaushala-26 rape case. As a rule of thumb, I choose to believe victims. The harassment she has faced—which culminated in her suicide attempt—beggars belief. She has remained steadfast against all pressure, rejecting advances to “settle” the case. It is hard to imagine why else anyone would willingly subject themselves to such inhumane treatment. This reflection, though, is not just about whether Sandeep raped Gaushala-26. My focus here is to examine Sandeep’s case as a textbook example of how our institutions perpetuate rape culture, where sexual abuse and violence are normalised. Custodian 1: The fansEver since Sandeep has been accused, the vast majority of his fans have taken to social media to defend him, as well as to defame the victim. Perhaps it is no surprise in a deeply patriarchal society in the grips of populism, where hero worship has taken new heights. Sandeep is a hero to many, and apparently he can do no wrong. Or, even if he wrongs, he is still above the law because he can bowl a mean googly, and that’s what matters. These fans- mostly but not exclusively young men- are vocal in their support for Sandeep. Even when he was a convicted felon, never mind when he was just accused of being a rapist- that too potentially of a minor- cricket mattered more to his devotees. Such craze toward their favourite cricketer substantially sustained a rape culture where allegations of sexual abuse were relegated to oblivion. When an overwhelming, assertive, visible, and vitriolic population aggressively downplays rape charges, it extinguishes any hope victims might have in their elusive quest for justice. Custodian 2: The courtsEvery level of the court system has already weighed in on Sandeep’s case. The Supreme Court—in its infinite wisdom—allowed him to represent the national team and travel abroad while on trial for rape charges. Along with the Prime Minister, who found it fitting to felicitate Sandeep in the middle of his trial, the Supreme Court’s tacit endorsement of Sandeep has made a mockery of victims’ rights and cemented rape culture as the established norm in Nepal. The Kathmandu District Court was at least bold enough to convict Sandeep of rape, though it did not find the victim to be a minor, which would have led to more significant consequences for Sandeep. Knowledge sources had commented then that this was already paving the way for a successful appeal later, which soon came to pass. The High Court overturned that conviction, acquitting Sandeep of all charges. Almost instantaneously, the fans came out in droves and celebrated that decision. Social media is swarmed with comments about how if Sandeep was punished when convicted, he should be reinstated immediately now that he is acquitted. It is an open secret that the judiciary- like many other institutions in Nepal- is compromised. Power and privilege run deep, and decisions are not just made on the merits of the legal argument. To all the fans now celebrating Sandeep’s acquittal and making that the basis for his rehabilitation, I have just one question: If you are from a poor family and if your loved one is sexually assaulted by someone rich, powerful, or politically connected, do you genuinely expect our judicial system to impart justice and punish the perpetrator? Take a moment, put yourself in the shoes of Gaushala-26’s family, and reflect on this question. If you honestly believe that justice would be served, I have a bridge to sell you.Custodian 3: CAN and the cricketing fraternityThe Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) has towed a fine line, appearing to uphold the law in the strictest sense. As soon as Sandeep was convicted, CAN suspended him from all cricketing activities. He was only reinstated after he was acquitted by the High Court. Dig a bit deeper though, and rape culture rears its ugly head. Even while facing serious rape charges, CAN was not compelled by any sense of morality to prevent him from representing Nepal. Within moments of the High Court’s acquittal, CAN officials rushed to announce that Sandeep had been reinstated. They went above and beyond to lobby the US Embassy to grant him a visa on time. When that failed, they facilitated his travel to St. Vincent and the Grenadines for him to play the remaining matches. They have lobbied the International Cricket Council to ensure his inclusion while sacrificing another player from the squad. To be sure, CAN has faced incredible scrutiny and received intense pressure from “the fans” to back Sandeep. Yet, the rush to not only rehabilitate but actually elevate Sandeep demonstrates that CAN only saw the case as a nuisance. Even if the legal burden of proof might not have been met, CAN could and should have investigated whether Sandeep met the national team’s code of conduct, as has been customary in similar cases around the world. It should have taken time to study the decision, and it could have waited for the legal process to reach its logical conclusion; it is all but certain that a Supreme Court appeal will follow. What CAN has not done speaks volumes of how rape culture is sustained in Nepal. To my knowledge, no official has spoken publicly about whether Sandeep’s actions violated the expectations placed on national players, or expressed concern or solidarity for the victim. The reasons for Sandeep’s absence have been conveniently ignored, as if he has simply been on holiday or nursing a minor injury. Just as his absence was unexplained, so too has his return been left ‘unsaid’. The gaslighting of the entire saga shows the contempt with which the issue is treated in Nepal. The wider cricketing fraternity—which includes players, former players, coaches, commentators, sponsors, and officials—has, at best, adopted a veil of silence or, at worst, come out publicly in Sandeep’s support. Respected national and international commentators have found it convenient to use phrases such as “Sandeep is not available” when away and “Sandeep, the talisman of Nepali cricket, is back” now, without any mention of the dark context. A moment to engage with and educate a whole nation on how to take rape charges, and its victim, seriously has been left unaddressed. Because, of course, cricket comes first. A naïve hopeI expect the backlash to this piece to be swift and severe. It feels poignant that I am travelling to watch Nepal play in the World Cup in the very matches Sandeep will now play. But his celebrated return has filled me with dread, anxiety, and disgust, to the point that I do not know how to support my beloved team anymore. Spare a thought for Gaushala-26 and for all victims of rape and rape culture. Regardless of the legalese, we must strive to build a culture where victims are empowered and supported to speak up and stand for the truth. Nepali cricket has always found a way through adversity, often miraculously. Our obsession with star power must be replaced with a focus on the role cricket, and citizens, should play in sustaining a culture of accountability and respect for victims. As amazing as it is, cricket is still only a game and must become a vehicle for good, not evil.  "},{"hash":"19b12076704f69cadb6b3ad819afb3b58cf8e4ba73b5279ddaa46962ebb50684","title":"**Exodus of Human Capital**\n\nHighly skilled workers are leaving their countries in large numbers.

The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement.

After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement.
