In about 50 countries, the Peace Walks are complemented by diverse peace-building activities. The worldwide events include landmark walks reflecting each nation's unique character, alongside peace performances, video screenings, photo exhibitions, poster drawings, sports activities, bazaars, and volunteer opportunities. Tree planting ceremonies and \"free hugs\" initiatives further emphasize the spirit of unity and environmental well-being.\nThis annual event commemorates the 2013 proclamation of the Declaration of World Peace at the Peace Gate in Seoul Olympic Park with 30,000 global youth advocating peace. This declaration outlines the roles of individuals from all walks of life in achieving peace and urges a united global effort.\nAt the 10th annual commemoration last year Chairman Lee Man-hee said, \"Since we pledged to work together for world peace 10 years ago, we have been calling for peace all over the world. We have advocated that peace should be taught at home and at school, and that everyone should become messengers of peace.\" He also emphasized, \"Everyone should be one under the title of peace and work together to create a good world and make it a legacy for future generations. This is what we need to do in this era in which we live.\"\nHWPL recently issued a statement on the Israel-Iran conflict and highlighted the devastating impact on civilians. \"Organizations worldwide, in alliance with HWPL as peace solidarity, urge Iran and Israel to put a stop to the acts of aggression immediately and to come forward for conversations to usher in peace,” the statement said.\nIn Nepal, HWPL’s 11th Annual Commemoration of the Declaration of World Peace and Peace Walk was held at Pokhara Aadarsha Secondary School and Vindhyaswori Adarsha Boarding School on May 26. About 70 students from each school gathered to learn about HWPL's peace activities and then took a walk for peace at each school playground. Balshiksha Preschool signed an MOU with HWPL and signed up for membership.\n\n"},{"hash":"e0693681405268ded8822cdc608b8fe83c172d2db4b09985796f697c279ce99a","title":"papua-new-guinea-reports-more-than-2-000-people-buried-in-landslide","date":1716768000000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/global/papua-new-guinea-reports-more-than-2-000-people-buried-in-landslide","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/445356725_373126522411515_4460861507282723657_n1716792494_1024.jpg","category":"global","content":"\nPapua

But now that the committee is in place, when it will start the investigation is still unsure. And no parties, including those on whose demand the panel was formed, have shown any urgency to start the probe.Following an agreement among the major parties, the House of Representatives on Tuesday formed a seven-member committee headed by CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa.Its other members are Sarita Bhusal of the UML, Ishwari Neupane and Badri Pandey of the Nepali Congress, Lekhnath Dahal of the CPN (Maoist Centre), Shishir Khanal of the Rastriya Swatantra Party and Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party.The committee members say they are not sure when the investigation will begin.

The panel must prepare its working procedure within the framework finalised by the committee led by Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs.The Giri-led panel had agreed on four terms of reference (ToR) for the probe committee.As per the ToR, the committee will investigate cooperatives facing crisis, their legal and institutional purposes, financial systems, regulations, supervision, and transparency, and make recommendations to the government.Another task is to recommend measures for the immediate return of savings to the depositors of the crisis-ridden cooperatives identified by the Department of Cooperatives and the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee. The parliamentary panel has also been mandated to study and analyse the progress of the savings protection and return by the crisis-ridden cooperatives.The Department of Cooperatives has listed 20 cooperatives as crisis-ridden, with billions of depositors’ money at risk.Another task the Thapa-led committee needs to accomplish is tracking the condition of funds from problematic cooperatives. The funds include those allegedly transferred to the Gorkha Media Network which operated the now-shuttered Galaxy 4K television once managed by Rabi Lamichhane, who is the deputy prime minister and home minister in the coalition government, and other companies and organisations.

The government did not increase allocation for social security schemes in the budget presented last week, and it did not introduce any new programmes for social security. “If Oli read the inability to spend more on social security as the government’s failure to orient the budget along the constitutional goal of socialism, he is mistaken,” said a finance ministry official on condition of anonymity. “We are facing resource constraints to set aside more funds for such distributive programmes.”“Socialism is a buzzword among communist parties. To be pragmatic, however, the funds available are not enough to introduce a socialism-oriented budget,” the officer told the Post.Nepal’s new constitution, promulgated in 2015, envisions Nepal as a socialism-oriented country. Nonetheless, the private sector has been given control over all important facets of the public and economic spheres.The Nepali Congress champions liberalisation and privatisation, but the party's guiding principle is democratic socialism. Other political parties, including the UML and other communist forces, follow a similar path. Though the constitution mentions Nepal as a socialism-oriented democracy, the charter does not define socialism. Even Parliament has not considered the matter a topic of discussion. “There is a lot of confusion over what socialism actually means in our context,” Surendra Pandey, a former finance minister and vice-chair of the UML, told the Post.Nepal’s political parties should compete in a production-oriented economy rather than a distributive one, Pandey suggested. “If we only focus on distribution-oriented fiscal policies, our economy will eventually stagnate.”A look at world history shows that revolution and evolution are the two bases to achieve socialism, Pandey said. “After their revolutions, countries like France and China nationalised the properties of the erstwhile rulers and distributed them to the public apart from enacting other reforms in order to achieve socialism.”In Nepal, “we need to abide by evolution-based reforms to attain socialism,” Pandey said. Many European countries follow this model. Incomes and properties of the rich are taxed to raise funds for social-security programmes, he added. “However, if we are looking for a distribution-oriented scheme for political gains, then it won’t yield significant results in the long run.”Economists also believe that a socialism-oriented budget is unrealistic during a time of economic hardship. They say the budgets presented even by the erstwhile Oli-led governments were far from socialism-oriented.Oli became prime minister two times: once after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015 and again after the first election held under the same constitution in 2017. The governments he led presented at least three budgets. “Apart from running some fair-price shops or selling some goats and sheep on the occasion of Dashain-Tihar, no government in Nepal has taken any concrete steps to build a socialist-oriented community as mentioned in the constitution,” Dipendra Bahadur Chhetri, a former governor of the Nepal Rastra Bank, told the Post. “This was also true of the previous Oli-led governments.” Chhetri said that the budget for the next fiscal year is conservative. “The communist-led government is always criticised for its distribution-oriented budget, which comes to galvanise its populist agenda,” added Chhetri. “But it’s an illusion to believe that a distribution-oriented budget with a focus on social security schemes is the way towards socialism.”Oli on Saturday instructed his party’s lawmakers to freely criticise the government if they find any instances of budget allocation in breach of the principle. “As a ruling party, we support this budget and will help with its implementation,” Oli said. “However, this does not mean that we should not point out deficiencies in the budget.”Addressing the parliamentary party meeting, Oli expressed his displeasure at lack of consultations among the ruling partners. He also raised the question of whether the budget was prepared by the finance minister himself or by the Maoist party he represents.“The budget could have been much better if the finance minister had engaged in more extensive consultation with the coalition partners,” Oli said.President Ramchandra Paudel presented the government’s policies and programmes in Parliament on May 14. In principle, the finance minister prepares the annual budget based on the policies and programmes and the feedback given by lawmakers during the deliberations on the policies and programmes.However, the policies and programmes could not be discussed in Parliament this time owing to its prolonged obstruction by the main opposition Congress demanding a parliamentary probe in the cooperatives fraud.

He repaid the loan within three years. In 2003, Panta decided to take loan again by using the same land as collateral. But Rastriya Banijya Bank refused to issue a loan this time stating that the loan could not be issued by maintaining the land as collateral. He also attempted to take a loan from other private banks but they denied it for the same reason.Of late, various banks have set up their branches in the administrative centre of the local units. But Panta—who hails from Bhuda in Belauri Municipality-10, Kanchanpur—and many people like him are deprived of taking loans by using the land that lies near Nepal-India border as collateral.Border disputes occur quite frequently in Bhuda area. There are border disputes in around a dozen of places in Kanchanpur district. And despite having land ownership certificates, the local residents cannot use the land for collateral for bank loans due to the border disputes. Even where there are no border disputes, the banks do not agree to issue loans by maintaining the land as collateral if the land is near the Nepal-India border.Top Bahadur Chand of Bhuda faced a similar problem five years ago as he needed a bank loan to send his son abroad for further studies. He owned 10 katthas of land adjoining the no-man’s-land. But the government as well as private banking institutions refused to maintain the land as collateral for the loan. “I had no alternative to selling the land after the banks refused loans,” Chand said. “I needed Rs1 million. I had to sell the land at cheaper prices after I could not manage the loan.”Like Panta and Chand, the local people living near the Nepal-India border are deprived of using their land for loan purposes. “The local people in the area are forced to borrow loans from money lenders at high interest rates as the financial institutions refuse to use our land for collateral,” Panta said. The local people urge the government authorities to ease their problem.The Chaudhar river flows through the middle of Bhuda. The river is the natural border of two countries—eastern side is Nepal and western side is India. But the financial institutions set their own standards regarding the border for issuing loans. They do not use the land from 200 metres to one kilometre inside the Nepal-India border for collateral.Pankaj Bhatta, manager of Nabil Bank in Belauri, said the insitution does not accept land up to 500 metres from the no-man’s-land and the criteria is even higher where there are border disputes. “The banks have their own internal directives and working guidelines,” Bhatta said. “They accept collateral only after risk evaluation.”Nepal Bank Limited, the country’s oldest commercial bank, does not accept land within 200 metres from the no-man’s-land for collateral. “In the case of the disputed border area, we cannot use the land up to one kilometre from the border for collateral. The collateral is used based on risk evaluation,” said Mahesh Raj Joshi, manager of Mahendranagar branch of Nepal Bank Limited.Generally, the lands that lie on the banks of the rivers or streams, lands that are not connected with roads, lands having legal complications, lands that are registered only before six months and the lands acquired by the government cannot be used as collateral for loan purposes. But the commercial banks make their own guidelines to reject the lands for collateral purposes.Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal which regulates financial institutions, says that there is no such regulation regarding the land that borders with the no-man’s-land for collateral. “There are no such working guidelines that prevent using the lands adjoining Nepal-India for collateral,” said Bhagawat Acharya, assistant information officer at the Nepal Rastra Bank central office.Not only the hassle in taking bank loans, the local people living near Nepal-India border have to endure several other problems. Seema Suraksha Bal (SSB) personnel sometimes prevent people from using the lands that they have land ownership certificates of, entering Nepali side with weapons and obstructing the carrying out development activities, among others.Nepal and India share a 129.5-km-long border in Kanchanpur district. According to the information provided by the authorities, there are a total of 390 main, subsidiary and minor border pillars in the district. Among them, 32 pillars have gone missing while 41 pillars were damaged by the floods. Many other border pillars are in a dilapidated condition.Due to the border disputes caused by the absence of border pillars, the local people claim that India’s SSB frequently interferes with construction activities including road construction on the Nepali side. They even create disturbances in tree plantation programmes in the community forests on the Nepali side of the border.There are border disputes in Pyaratal to Aanandabazaar of Punarbas, Pachui and Bhuda areas of Belauri Municipality, Jhimlima of Beldadi Rural Municipality, Kutiyakbhar to Baduwatol of Dodhara Chandani Municipality and Bramhadev area of Bhumdutta Municipality in Kanchanpur.

It had rained the previous evening after a prolonged drought. “The land was ready for planting, but the problem is hybrid maize seeds are not available in our area,” complained Neupane. “We even went to Kathmandu looking for hybrid maize seeds, but we couldn’t find any there either.”This year, several districts, including Rasuwa, experienced drought-like conditions, which prevented farmers from cultivating maize on lands that rely mostly on rainwater.As the maize cultivation season has already ended, the premonsoon rainfall, which occurred only in the last week of May, could not bring relief to farmers like Neupane and other villagers of Rasuwa. Some farmers want to cultivate water-resistant and fast-maturing hybrid crops, but seeds for such crops are not available in the market.“If we sow locally available seeds, plants will grow quickly, and they will be knocked down by wind and rain,” complained Anjila Wasti, another villager. “Seeds cultivated in April either didn’t germinate or were eaten by pests.”Nepal has been affected by the climate crisis. Over the past few years, droughts and dry spells in the cultivation season and floods and inundations in the harvesting season have become a new normal in the country.A recent report of the National Climate Change Survey-2022, carried out by the National Statistics Office, states that climate change has far-reaching consequences, impacting communities, transportation, water resources, biodiversity, agriculture, health, and the economy. The intensification of climate extremes, such as high temperatures, heavy rainfall, drought, landslides, floods, and wildfires, has made predictions of impacts more challenging.Climate change has significant and far-reaching impacts on agriculture in Nepal, a predominantly agrarian country with a large portion of its population engaged in farming, reads the report. “These impacts affect crop yields, food security, and the livelihoods of millions of people.”Over the past 25 years, approximately 50 percent of households reported the emergence of new diseases in their crops, nearly 54 percent observed the presence of new insects or pests affecting their crops, and around 30 percent of households noted the appearance of new diseases in their livestock.Government agencies, which are not tired of discussing “climate change adaptation action”, do not bother to offer drought- and water-resistant seeds to affected farmers.“We are only addressing the immediate effects of drought and climate crisis on farmers,” said Madhukar Upadhya, an expert on climate change. “Climate change, prolonged drought for instance, will have chain effects on food security, animal husbandry, health, education, and women empowerment.”When the authorities failed to take necessary measures to protect farmers from erratic weather patterns, migration became their only option.Kabita Khatri, the mother of a five-year-old girl from Bidur in Nuwakot district, has found a housemaid job in Kathmandu.

One emerges as a powerhouse, while the other struggles to meet domestic demand and control the circulation of substandard medicine. Nepal’s pharmaceutical landscape reveals multifaceted challenges, ranging from regulatory hurdles and infrastructure deficiencies to limited research and development capabilities. In contrast, Bangladesh’s success story is underpinned by strategic initiatives, innovative policies and a resilient entrepreneurial spirit. This disparity begs the question: What lessons can Nepal learn from Bangladesh?Bangladesh’s approachesAs a least developed country (LDC), Nepal benefits from exemptions under international agreements, particularly intellectual property rights. These include dismissal from many Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) standards until July 1, 2034, and from providing pharmaceutical patents until January 1, 2033. Despite these advantages, Nepal has not fully leveraged these provisions. Meanwhile, Bangladesh, another LDC, has capitalised on TRIPS flexibilities, abolishing product patent protection in 2008. This strategic move has fostered a thriving pharmaceutical sector, producing affordable generics and exporting to over 150 countries. According to the Bangladesh Pharma Market and Regulatory Report, Bangladesh is not only self-reliant on generic drugs, serving 97 percent of the domestic market and exporting to more than 150 countries, but also produces complex anti-cancer drugs, hepatitis-C vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, biotech products and hormones.Nepal’s scenarioIn the pharmaceutical sector, success means either producing intermediate products such as active pharmaceutical ingredients like raw materials, producing generic medicine at competitive prices, or adding value to complex medicines with technology. Unfortunately, Nepal fails to achieve any of these—a heavy reliance on imports and a struggling domestic industry plague Nepal. One case lists 126 pharmaceutical manufacturers, the majority producing generic drugs necessitating imports of other types of medications to Nepal. The Nepali pharmaceutical market is valued at Rs53 billion, with imports accounting for 54.5 percent of the total market share. In another case, Nepal’s southern neighbour, India, is a dominant pharmaceutical player (especially generic drugs). It exports drugs to over 200 countries and captures a significant global market share. India's technological advancement in this sector inherently enables the production of more cost-effective alternatives, posing a formidable challenge for Nepal's domestic industries to compete. To foster self-reliance, the Nepal Government imposed an import ban on 37 generic medicines produced by its domestic companies.While protectionist measures such as banning competition may offer short-term benefits to interest groups, there are concerning long-term implications for consumer welfare. The cost of health for the general public has now increased. As consumers, we bear the burden of higher prices for incompetent products. With lesser competition, there are now abundant substandard drugs in the market. We are compelled to consume the paracetamol produced by companies such as Nepal Drugs Limited, which was banned for not complying with the WHO standards. Additionally, sodium chloride and ringer lactate solution for injection, manufactured by a leading pharmaceutical company in Nepal, Lomus Parentals and Formulation Pvt Ltd., was found to be substandard in laboratory tests. These are just some of the many troubling reports.Furthermore, the pharmaceutical industry in Nepal faces a significant challenge due to the lack of standardisation. The presence of numerous unregistered drugs exacerbates this vulnerability, amplified by Nepal's proximity to India, a hub for pharmaceutical production with 35 percent of the market share in counterfeit drugs. Despite efforts to regulate the industry, the current workforce of 38 drug inspectors is insufficient to adequately monitor the thousands of pharmacies and the medicines they distribute. This strain on resources intensifies the challenges of ensuring pharmaceutical quality and safety in Nepal. Therefore, instead of investing significantly in loss-bearing state-owned Nepal Drugs Limited, the government should allocate its infrastructure and resources to monitoring the quality of medicines.In Nepal, 100 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are sourced, majority of them from India and the rest from China. While Nepal is yet to fully leverage the TRIPS provisions, Bangladesh recognised that fully leveraging its status as an LDC member necessitated the production of patented APIs at a reduced cost. Today, Bangladesh offers VAT waivers and VAT deduction at source on purchase and sales of locally made APIs, laboratory reagents, all raw materials, immovable assets and services up to 2032. Unlike Nepal's five-year term loans for factories and equipment, Bangladesh provides a 12-year tenure, facilitating long-term investments. Moreover, Bangladesh allows for export earning retention of 40 percent, encouraging companies to focus on research and development to boost exports. It also imposes no single borrower cap and offers back-to-back letters of credit facilities. But Nepal has limitations on borrowing. Information gapAnother challenge in Nepal's pharmaceutical industry is the gap in information. Consider this: When illness strikes, whom do we turn to? Typically, it's the expertise of a trusted medical professional. Do we question their prescriptions or the associated costs? Rarely. This lack of scrutiny renders the price of medicine largely inflexible. How about our knowledge of available options? Do we actively seek alternatives or simply go with what's prescribed? More often than not, doctors are the main decision-makers in this arena.Pharmaceutical companies navigate this by relying heavily on marketing representatives to engage doctors. In Nepal, all drugs are generic, and their formulas have been available in the public domain for a long time. So, the only way for manufacturers to stand out is through aggressive marketing tactics, often offering lucrative incentives for doctors to prescribe specific brands.Policy questionThis brings us to a crucial policy question: How can the government redirect its focus to fostering innovation within the industry instead of incentivising doctors? To tackle this issue, some countries around the globe have implemented legislation mandating the prescription of medicine by their generic names. Bangladesh has taken a different approach to resolving this. A 20 percent cash incentive is provided if producers add at least 20 percent value to the API. This has incentivised the local API producers to innovate the health industry rather than sustain in the market by providing lucrative Public Relations packages to the doctors or by producing substandard products at a lower cost. Like in the case of Bangladesh, enhancing competitiveness through a free-market approach could offer a sustainable solution to address the vulnerabilities of the Nepali pharmaceutical industry. Finally, for any industry to progress, embracing technological advancement along with investment is imperative. One potential avenue for this advancement lies in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). However, securing FDI, particularly in this sector, is complicated, as the research and development spending of the pharmaceutical industry is 8.1 times higher than that of the aerospace industry, 7.2 times that of the chemical industry, and 1.2 times that of the computer services industry. Therefore, improving the overall business environment and ease of doing business index of Nepal is imperative to attract FDI. It is essential to embrace the power of the free market to heal Nepal’s pharmaceutical industry. Bangladesh's success story shows how competition can drive innovation and affordability. Sometimes, abolishing patents leads to the spread of information, followed by innovation. By leveraging TRIPS flexibilities, Nepal can enable local companies to produce affordable generics and pioneer new treatments that address the unique healthcare needs of Nepali citizens. ","summary":"Think of a situation where two South Asian nations—Bangladesh and Nepal—face similar socio-economic constraints but take divergent pharmaceutical journeys. One emerges as a powerhouse, while the other struggles to meet domestic demand and control the circulation of substandard medicine. Nepal’s pharmaceutical landscape reveals multifaceted challenges, ranging from regulatory hurdles and infrastructure deficiencies to limited research and development capabilities. In contrast, Bangladesh’s success story is underpinned by strategic initiatives, innovative policies and a resilient entrepreneurial spirit. This disparity begs the question: What lessons can Nepal learn from Bangladesh?Bangladesh’s approachesAs a least developed country (LDC), Nepal benefits from exemptions under international agreements, particularly intellectual property rights. These include dismissal from many Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) standards until July 1, 2034, and from providing pharmaceutical patents until January 1, 2033. Despite these advantages, Nepal has not fully leveraged these provisions. Meanwhile, Bangladesh, another LDC, has capitalised on TRIPS flexibilities, abolishing product patent protection in 2008. This strategic move has fostered a thriving pharmaceutical sector, producing affordable generics and exporting to over 150 countries. According to the Bangladesh Pharma Market and Regulatory Report, Bangladesh is not only self-reliant on generic drugs, serving 97 percent of the domestic market and exporting to more than 150 countries, but also produces complex anti-cancer drugs, hepatitis-C vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, biotech products and hormones.Nepal’s scenarioIn the pharmaceutical sector, success means either producing intermediate products such as active pharmaceutical ingredients like raw materials, producing generic medicine at competitive prices, or adding value to complex medicines with technology. Unfortunately, Nepal fails to achieve any of these—a heavy reliance on imports and a struggling domestic industry plague Nepal. One case lists 126 pharmaceutical manufacturers, the majority producing generic drugs necessitating imports of other types of medications to Nepal. The Nepali pharmaceutical market is valued at Rs53 billion, with imports accounting for 54.5 percent of the total market share. In another case, Nepal’s southern neighbour, India, is a dominant pharmaceutical player (especially generic drugs). It exports drugs to over 200 countries and captures a significant global market share. India's technological advancement in this sector inherently enables the production of more cost-effective alternatives, posing a formidable challenge for Nepal's domestic industries to compete. To foster self-reliance, the Nepal Government imposed an import ban on 37 generic medicines produced by its domestic companies.While protectionist measures such as banning competition may offer short-term benefits to interest groups, there are concerning long-term implications for consumer welfare. The cost of health for the general public has now increased. As consumers, we bear the burden of higher prices for incompetent products. With lesser competition, there are now abundant substandard drugs in the market. We are compelled to consume the paracetamol produced by companies such as Nepal Drugs Limited, which was banned for not complying with the WHO standards. Additionally, sodium chloride and ringer lactate solution for injection, manufactured by a leading pharmaceutical company in Nepal, Lomus Parentals and Formulation Pvt Ltd., was found to be substandard in laboratory tests. These are just some of the many troubling reports.Furthermore, the pharmaceutical industry in Nepal faces a significant challenge due to the lack of standardisation. The presence of numerous unregistered drugs exacerbates this vulnerability, amplified by Nepal's proximity to India, a hub for pharmaceutical production with 35 percent of the market share in counterfeit drugs. Despite efforts to regulate the industry, the current workforce of 38 drug inspectors is insufficient to adequately monitor the thousands of pharmacies and the medicines they distribute. This strain on resources intensifies the challenges of ensuring pharmaceutical quality and safety in Nepal. Therefore, instead of investing significantly in loss-bearing state-owned Nepal Drugs Limited, the government should allocate its infrastructure and resources to monitoring the quality of medicines.In Nepal, 100 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are sourced, majority of them from India and the rest from China. While Nepal is yet to fully leverage the TRIPS provisions, Bangladesh recognised that fully leveraging its status as an LDC member necessitated the production of patented APIs at a reduced cost. Today, Bangladesh offers VAT waivers and VAT deduction at source on purchase and sales of locally made APIs, laboratory reagents, all raw materials, immovable assets and services up to 2032. Unlike Nepal's five-year term loans for factories and equipment, Bangladesh provides a 12-year tenure, facilitating long-term investments. Moreover, Bangladesh allows for export earning retention of 40 percent, encouraging companies to focus on research and development to boost exports. It also imposes no single borrower cap and offers back-to-back letters of credit facilities. But Nepal has limitations on borrowing. Information gapAnother challenge in Nepal's pharmaceutical industry is the gap in information. Consider this: When illness strikes, whom do we turn to? Typically, it's the expertise of a trusted medical professional. Do we question their prescriptions or the associated costs? Rarely. This lack of scrutiny renders the price of medicine largely inflexible. How about our knowledge of available options? Do we actively seek alternatives or simply go with what's prescribed? More often than not, doctors are the main decision-makers in this arena.Pharmaceutical companies navigate this by relying heavily on marketing representatives to engage doctors. In Nepal, all drugs are generic, and their formulas have been available in the public domain for a long time. So, the only way for manufacturers to stand out is through aggressive marketing tactics, often offering lucrative incentives for doctors to prescribe specific brands.Policy questionThis brings us to a crucial policy question: How can the government redirect its focus to fostering innovation within the industry instead of incentivising doctors? To tackle this issue, some countries around the globe have implemented legislation mandating the prescription of medicine by their generic names. Bangladesh has taken a different approach to resolving this. A 20 percent cash incentive is provided if producers add at least 20 percent value to the API. This has incentivised the local API producers to innovate the health industry rather than sustain in the market by providing lucrative Public Relations packages to the doctors or by producing substandard products at a lower cost. Like in the case of Bangladesh, enhancing competitiveness through a free-market approach could offer a sustainable solution to address the vulnerabilities of the Nepali pharmaceutical industry. Finally, for any industry to progress, embracing technological advancement along with investment is imperative. One potential avenue for this advancement lies in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). However, securing FDI, particularly in this sector, is complicated, as the research and development spending of the pharmaceutical industry is 8.1 times higher than that of the aerospace industry, 7.2 times that of the chemical industry, and 1.2 times that of the computer services industry. Therefore, improving the overall business environment and ease of doing business index of Nepal is imperative to attract FDI. It is essential to embrace the power of the free market to heal Nepal’s pharmaceutical industry. Bangladesh's success story shows how competition can drive innovation and affordability. Sometimes, abolishing patents leads to the spread of information, followed by innovation. By leveraging TRIPS flexibilities, Nepal can enable local companies to produce affordable generics and pioneer new treatments that address the unique healthcare needs of Nepali citizens.

The longest conflict of the 21st century has erupted into a full-fledged war, this time with Hamas at the forefront, fighting for Palestinian statehood. While Israel maintains military dominance over the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, recent events have shattered its image of having an unbreachable defense and a powerful, moral military. In this piece, we will examine the events that have unfolded since the armed incursion and their implications.Following the Palestinian “intifadas” (uprisings) in 1987 and 2000 against Israeli occupation, Palestinians have continued their struggle through various means, including protests, boycotts, arts and theatres. Though these intifadas led to the signing of the Oslo Accords and Israeli disengagement from Gaza, respectively, they have not yielded significant results. Soon after, despite being considered a terrorist organisation by countries like the United States, Hamas secured a victory over the ruling party, Fatah, in the second Palestinian Legislative Election held in 2006. The rise of Hamas, driven by anti-Zionist and anti-imperialist ideologies, led to several Israeli raids in Gaza and the West Bank, resulting in the capture of senior leaders and the imposition of sanctions.Fast forward to October 7, 2023, Hamas carried out an armed incursion (Operation Al-Aqsa Flood) from the Gaza Strip into Southern Israel and took Israeli hostages as leverage for the diplomatic efforts. While this event tarnished Israel's image of an unbreachable defense, the consequences of the event thereafter have proved fatal for the Palestinians. The Israeli military ordered an evacuation of 1.1 million Gazans living in the north of Gaza within 24 hours on October 13, which the Palestinians describe today as the “second Nakba (displacement)”. Armed by the US and its allies, Israel started its ground invasion in Gaza on October 27, followed by the indiscriminate bombing of hospitals and civilian infrastructure on account of eliminating Hamas. However, the extreme measures taken by the Israeli government led by Netanyahu have proved catastrophic in a geopolitical context and are far from achieving its goal of eradicating Hamas. Moreover, the adventure has become an uphill battle for the Israelis and their allies.Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, led by Hamas, though it reached the brink of instigating a full-blown regional conflict, diplomatic efforts have prevailed in avoiding this nightmare. However, Houthis in Yemen have joined the force of resistance by blocking the passage of the Red Sea for Israeli ships and its allies. The initiative of the US to hold Yemen responsible for its action, which involved the bombing of Yemeni military facilities along with the UK and the formation of a multinational force to protect trade in the Red Sea, has failed. Additionally, the possibility of Hezbollah—a Lebanese political and military group led by Hassan Nasrallah, which has been very vocal in its support for the ongoing resistance by Hamas—joining the conflict full-fledged still lingers as Israel and Hezbollah continue to engage in frequent skirmishes on parts of Israel-Lebanon border, occupied Golan Heights and Syria. However, this would be a big blow to Netanyahu’s government, as Hezbollah is a far superior military group than Hamas. Losing support at home and flexing its military prowess, Netanyahu’s government struck the Iranian Embassy Complex in Syria, killing 16 people, including eight members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in April. Moreover, one can also interpret this attack as an Israeli frustration against the Iranian-backed resistance groups in the region (including Hamas, Hezbollah and other proxies) and an attempt to drag the US into a confrontation. This attack, condemned by numerous countries, proved fatal to the Israelis as Iran retaliated with missile and drone strikes on some of the Israeli military bases within its territory. The response by the Iranians to the unprecedented attack on its embassy sent a clear message to both the United States and the Israelis about its military arsenal and its readiness to retaliate against any escalation. This event not only exposed a gaping hole in Israel's defense but also etched Iran as a formidable power in the region. Furthermore, the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict has left inedible repercussions on Israel's standing in the global community. The harrowing images and videos coming out of the Gaza Strip have left the international governing body speechless and have led people to reason for Israel as a genocidal state. Since the start of the conflict, the Palestinian death toll has exceeded 35,000, with 80,000 more injured. The repercussions of these events are sure to leave an indelible mark on Israel's image, as the International Criminal Court has sought legal action by issuing an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defence Minister Gallant. In a diplomatic fallout, Bolivia has severed all diplomatic ties with Israel, while Chile, Colombia, Jordan, Bahrain, Honduras, Turkey, Chad, South Africa and Belize have recalled their ambassadors. Additionally, pro-Palestinian protests across US campuses, which later spread to Europe and other regions, have dealt a significant blow to Israel, both from the public relations and diplomatic perspective. To add to that, talks on a two-state solution have gained much more momentum in the international community, and recently, Norway, Ireland and Spain have announced their willingness to recognise Palestine. However, the growing isolation of Israel in the international community has had little to no effect on its approach to the ongoing conflict. Days after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling to stop the Rafah offensive, Israel conducted an air strike, which left hundreds of civilians dead, including children. The silence of Western countries at a time when humanity is at stake is both tragic and horrifying. In contrast, to show strong support for the Israeli government, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Mike Johnson recently invited Netanyahu to speak in the US Congress. It is likely to undermine US diplomacy and its credibility as a peacekeeper across the globe in the future as it facilitates Israel's conduct of a war that’s been argued to be a “genocide”.

The investigation should neither be inspired by vendetta against anyone, including Lamichhane, nor by a desire to cleanse his name or those of anyone else found guilty of misappropriating people’s hard-earned money. It is thus vital that the committee, right at the start, builds an environment of trust by committing to a free and fair investigation. This should include open discussions on the matter and clear and consistent communication on the committee’s working and findings. Only then will the hundreds of thousands of victims of cooperative frauds get the justice they seek.

The uncanny political developments in the country have propelled the speed of these events. Little worried by the indications of the erosion of the hard-earned democratic values and practices seen in political coalitions and the assault on media freedom, I briefly review the history of political leaders' dreams and failures in this column. I want to show that we, the people, bear the brunt of history’s tragic and farcical turns. An important shift has occurred in Nepali history from the tragic to the ludicrous. Karl Marx, in his famous work The Eighteenth Brumaire Of Louis Bonaparte, said, \"All the great events and characters of history occur twice, firstly as tragedy, secondly as farce.\" No communist leaders of Nepal appear to have referred to this book and Marx's prophetic statement except Baburam Bhattarai, the erstwhile Maoist leader and comrade of the current Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has recently got the vote of confidence for the fourth time in 17 months. This is an interesting episode of political farce. Political parties and the cronies who are always proactive are reducing the democratic system established by people's sacrifice and dedication to a farce. That becomes clear if we watch the drama that happens in Parliament.There is a serious part to this historical shift. Marx also says, \"The social revolution of the nineteenth century cannot create its poetry from the past but only from the future”. This means that to draw strength and meaning from the past, you should create its poetry from the future. This is a little academic point. Repetition of historyThe Nepali democracy and those who have been given the responsibility to protect and use it precisely lack that vision of futurity; they do not perceive the poetry of the future. Their actions in parliament, narrow partisan behaviours, the reckless language they use, inadequate knowledge about the political dynamics of social change and the important time they squander away by acting irresponsibly all show that they lack the vision to create poetry from the future. I have begun to wonder whether the Nepali political parties will fully utilise the democratic political system to ameliorate the condition of the people of this land.The Nepali media fraternity says the sudden arrest of Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya on May 21, 2024, is unfair and \"motivated by personal vendetta.\" The agency in question is the coalition government led by Dahal and the Home Ministry. A certain revelation occurred to me after watching an interview with Bhattarai on Kantipur television on the same night. Bhattarai recalled one article he published in Kantipur in August 2001 about the royal massacre. I was mourning my mother's death in my village, Sabala of Terathum. I read that article to my elder brother and Nepali Congress district leader, Laya Prasad Subedi, who totally agreed with Bhattarai's analysis. The underground Maoist leader Bhattarai has said in that article the murders were the result of a \"political conspiracy\". Kailash Sirohiya and his co-publisher, Binod Raj Gyawali, and the editor-in-chief of Kantipur, Yubaraj Ghimire, were arrested for publishing that. Bhattarai said in the interview that he was stunned by the drama of Sirohiya's arrest, which shows an uncanny repetition of history. This time, he said, “Prachanda is in the position of the king, and the same media person is arrested, as the common opinion says, for publishing news stories about Prachanda's government.” Bhattarai also revealed that in a prime ministerial system like ours, no such decision is taken without the prime minister's consent. It is not the minister but the prime minister who can make such decisions, he explained.Whatever the position of parties and the leaders at the current moment of history, those who have followed the political history know that Bhattarai has always made decisions according to his understanding, conscience and interpretation of history. Bhattarai had declared that he was leaving the Maoist party because, metaphorically, it was not safe to live in the red-labelled house, which was a category of the badly damaged buildings after the earthquakes of 2015. I am dismayed by the performances of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. I am getting more and more disillusioned by his actions and those of the other communist leaders of different groups who are all in the coalition now. They include communist stalwarts like Dahal, KP Sharma Oli and Madhav Kumar Nepal. There is no point in talking about the behaviour of the individual ministers, whose sense of history and the missions often don't come to the fore. The coalition’s leader and a major actor Dahal is at the centre of the decisions in this system if we believe the interpretation of the former prime minister Bhattarai.It is challenging for all political leaders to maintain a history of their choice and to live up to the expectations of the people. Dahal is no exception. I want to recall one event here. Dahal had attended the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi in the third week of November 2006. Some people told me about him when I attended a literary conference in Delhi after that event. One professor, impressed with Dahal’s metamorphosis, gave me the news published in the paper. It cites Dahal saying, \"I have lived my life in jungle, now I will lead my life in light.\" Another report said, ''Nepal's firebrand Maoist leader Prachanda on Saturday said the political battle in the 21st century will be fought over democracy, which at present is in deep crisis.\" A euphoric Dahal, by his transformation, said while addressing the second session on the second day of the fourth Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi, \"Democracy will rule the world\". The report also said, \"The former Indian prime minister and admirer of Prachanda I. K. Gujaral says he had read about many epic stories about revolution and Prachanda has shown it by accomplishing an epic battle in Nepal.\"History says Dahal and other leaders have clearly failed to deliver. His and his various coalitions’ actions show that staying in power is their only goal. What has begun to worry nonpartisan academics and writers like us is that the power coalitions and groups only work with what Bertrand Russell calls the “lust for power.” The time has come for the free media, legal activists and civil society to be vigilant about protecting democracy.  ","summary":"These days, I watch Nepali television news more frequently and read broadsheet papers and online news to observe the clash of dreams and reality, particularly in political events.

Kailash Sirohiya and his co-publisher, Binod Raj Gyawali, and the editor-in-chief of Kantipur, Yubaraj Ghimire, were arrested for publishing that. Bhattarai said in the interview that he was stunned by the drama of Sirohiya's arrest, which shows an uncanny repetition of history. This time, he said, “Prachanda is in the position of the king, and the same media person is arrested, as the common opinion says, for publishing news stories about Prachanda's government.” Bhattarai also revealed that in a prime ministerial system like ours, no such decision is taken without the prime minister's consent. It is not the minister but the prime minister who can make such decisions, he explained.Whatever the position of parties and the leaders at the current moment of history, those who have followed the political history know that Bhattarai has always made decisions according to his understanding, conscience and interpretation of history. Bhattarai had declared that he was leaving the Maoist party because, metaphorically, it was not safe to live in the red-labelled house, which was a category of the badly damaged buildings after the earthquakes of 2015. I am dismayed by the performances of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. I am getting more and more disillusioned by his actions and those of the other communist leaders of different groups who are all in the coalition now. They include communist stalwarts like Dahal, KP Sharma Oli and Madhav Kumar Nepal. There is no point in talking about the behaviour of the individual ministers, whose sense of history and the missions often don't come to the fore. The coalition’s leader and a major actor Dahal is at the centre of the decisions in this system if we believe the interpretation of the former prime minister Bhattarai.It is challenging for all political leaders to maintain a history of their choice and to live up to the expectations of the people. Dahal is no exception. I want to recall one event here. Dahal had attended the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi in the third week of November 2006. Some people told me about him when I attended a literary conference in Delhi after that event. One professor, impressed with Dahal’s metamorphosis, gave me the news published in the paper. It cites Dahal saying, \"I have lived my life in jungle, now I will lead my life in light.\" Another report said, ''Nepal's firebrand Maoist leader Prachanda on Saturday said the political battle in the 21st century will be fought over democracy, which at present is in deep crisis.\" A euphoric Dahal, by his transformation, said while addressing the second session on the second day of the fourth Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi, \"Democracy will rule the world\". The report also said, \"The former Indian prime minister and admirer of Prachanda I. K. Gujaral says he had read about many epic stories about revolution and Prachanda has shown it by accomplishing an epic battle in Nepal.\"History says Dahal and other leaders have clearly failed to deliver. His and his various coalitions’ actions show that staying in power is their only goal. What has begun to worry nonpartisan academics and writers like us is that the power coalitions and groups only work with what Bertrand Russell calls the “lust for power.” The time has come for the free media, legal activists and civil society to be vigilant about protecting democracy.  "},{"hash":"8eb05a817cd87b756443cf10118035403026e91c36201dbd8003a0722c8f8e88","title":"speakers-are-supposed-to-be-neutral-not-all-succeed-in-the-role","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/05/19/speakers-are-supposed-to-be-neutral-not-all-succeed-in-the-role","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/Untitled2-1716084227.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1716076800000,"source":"kp","category":"national","content":"The Speaker of the House of Representatives is expected to run parliamentary proceedings impartially following democratic norms.

According to the latest data released by the Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal, deposits in banks and financial institutions (BFIs) have crossed the Rs6.16 trillion mark, while credit disbursement is Rs5.12 trillion. These two figures are 108 and 92 percent of Nepal's estimated Rs5.7 trillion gross domestic product (GDP), respectively. This means that even after maintaining mandatory cash ratios with the central bank—which amounts to around Rs3.6 trillion in aggregate—about Rs6.5 trillion is available as loanable liquidity in the banking system. This, indeed, should have been a god-sent historical opportunity to catapult Nepal to the next level of economic activities and growth. Sadly, that does not seem to be on the anvil.Now, the loan uptake by the entrepreneurs and investors is very slow. The credit growth is 2 percent slower than the deposit growth. The effective interest rate is still in double digits, hovering between 10 to 12 percent. For small borrowers who generally rely on microfinance institutions and credit cooperatives, the cost of funds is at least 20 percent. High interest rate is apparently one of the key deterrents to potential borrowers. Also, a higher amount of deposit collection compared to loan disbursement is taking a toll on the profitability of the BFIs.On one hand, despite most BFIs’ favourable loanable liquidity position, they are unwilling to cut the interest rate for fear of a further decline in profitability. Such practices blatantly compromise the principle of price determination in a free and complete market based on the quantity of funds demanded and supplied. On the other hand, non-performing loans (NPL) of the BFIs are rapidly growing. The total NPL was 3.6 percent of the total loan disbursement last January, which has now risen to 4.8 percent. In nominal terms, approximately Rs250 billion worth of loans is slipping into the risky zone. As its obvious aftermath, the number of borrowers blacklisted for their default on timely repayment is reported to be about 200 per day. This inescapable trap to businesses is created due to the growing number of business closures and increasing financial losses in those businesses struggling to survive. Economy in recessionTechnically, a recession is defined as a decline in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters. However, to the great relief of the ruling political leaders and bureaucracy, Nepal does not produce quarterly GDP growth data. If the annual growth forecasts like the recent ones from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which predicted Nepal's growth rate to be no more than 4 percent in 2024, are to be trusted, Nepal is clearly in a recessionary trajectory. Other disappointing trends in real income, industrial output, employment rate, wholesale and retail sales and overall service sector performance confirm that the economy went downhill in several successive quarters to arrive at this stage.Other rather subjective but evident recession traits are manifested in the form of pervasive plummeting of the consumers' confidence, investors' confidence, overall market confidence, and trust deficit on the incumbent government's sincerity as the principal agent supposed to work for the economic betterment of the country.The gapsThe economic revival looks challenging even in several years if the government fails to take bold countercyclical measures, mainly in revenue collection, capital expenditure and implementing fiscal federalism. And the monetary policy must improve corporate governance in the banking sector, which private sector players dominate by more than 90 percent. This is exactly where effective coordination between fiscal and monetary policies is indispensable.On the fiscal policy side, if the tax policy to find new revenue sources is not comprehensively recalibrated, the collected revenue, like in recent years, will continue to fall short of even meeting the current expenditures, let alone augmenting the capital expenditure and saving the country from default on sovereign debt servicing. The capital allocation in the federal budget is pathetic, persistently at less than 20 percent of total earmarks. Worse, the spending capacity has effectively come down to about 40 percent of even such a low allocation.Despite federalism devolving the constitutional authority to sub-national levels to devise 'their own' public procurement laws, timely completion of contractual procedures of the projects has been extremely tardy. The complications are added by the vested interests of the people in executive power in awarding contracts with apparent conflict of interest. When the government, as the single largest procurer, fails to spend its capital budget transparently, the cash flow in the financial market is bound to shrink. This has direct ramifications on the liquidity positions of the BFIs. The persistent failure of the governments at all three tiers to carry out the capital expenditure as outlined has a cumulative adverse impact.Trust the systemA sincere effort to put fiscal federalism into practice in the true spirit of the federal polity and state architecture will certainly solve several critical issues related to fiscal resource management at the provincial or municipal levels. For instance, reasonably effective management of the bond market at the centre helps generate resources for development expenditure. In allocation, the disbursement may be proportionate to the absorption capacity of an individual administrative unit like a ministry or a federal unit like a municipality. This would ameliorate a number of pending constraints faced by the entire financial system of the country. It is already too late to consider the legislation to empower competent municipalities to issue their own development bonds so as to enhance the fiscal policy independence of the local governments and increase the stakeholder ownership of the executed projects.To conclude, two critical steps are inevitable to rescue the economy from the brink of a deeper recession. One, a stimulus package with an amalgam of fiscal and monetary incentives is necessary. The business-as-usual budget will not solve new challenges to the economy, like the rapidly depleting base of state income. Two, the impending credit risk in BFIs will be far larger if the businesses are not put back on track by enabling them to unlock their full potential, now an existential threat due to the engulfing recession.

Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled “Implementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Nepal” is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime minister’s office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the plan’s signing.“It is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,” Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.“The country’s economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,” said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the “Silkroad Roadster” in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.“When the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime minister’s trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an ‘appropriate’ time,” former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. “We also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.”The Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The document’s sub-section 12 titled ‘Other Areas’ under section 3 named ‘Cooperation Priorities’ mentions that “the two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperation”.It also says “the two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster management”.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority. In every high-level visit and meeting between Nepal and China, the initiative gets traction.Although there is no clear provision on whether the two sides should renew the agreement by exchanging correspondence, officials at the finance ministry said that would be the diplomatically correct way to go about it.There are concerns over the BRI’s stalled momentum in Nepal. The initiative’s stated focus is connectivity, trade, development strategies, and policy dialogues for cooperation in the fields of economy, environment, technology and culture.The agreement also aims to facilitate transit transport, logistics, transport network security and related infrastructure development through joint study and promote cross-border projects including railway, road, civil aviation, power grid, information and communication. The MoU also states that the two sides would conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement shortly and, if viable, start negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement to open up more markets and expand bilateral trade.Other stated areas of agreed cooperation are establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones at the existing ports, and improving the investment landscape with a view to developing mega projects in the areas of power generation, water conservation, road, railway line, cross-border transmission line, information and communication technology and infrastructure, besides customs and quarantine.Nepal also had a shaky position on the BRI in the past. After signing the deal in 2017, the government formed two committees headed by the foreign and finance secretaries to negotiate with China on the projects selected under the initiative. The finance secretary was tasked with project selection.As per the Cabinet’s mandate, the finance secretary-led committee picked 35 projects to be funded under the BRI. Then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli read out this list during his meeting with Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. Later, the Chinese side urged Kathmandu to cut the number of projects to a single digit, whereupon the list was pared down to nine projects.A former finance ministry official who was involved in several negotiations with the Chinese side said most of the nine projects were related to connectivity and infrastructure. In 2019, during the second BRI Conference in China, its outcome document listed Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network under the BRI. (Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari had attended the conference.) Then, when Chinese President Xi visited Kathmandu in October 2019, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation under the BRI.They agreed “to intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network with a view to significantly contributing to Nepal’s development agenda of graduating from a Least Developed Country,” according to a joint statement issued after Xi’s visit to Kathmandu.The Chinese side was keen to carry out the feasibility study of Kerung-Kathmandu railway under the BRI, the former finance ministry official said. “But we have shifting priorities on selecting and negotiating other projects.”The feasibility study of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway has already begun with a Chinese grant and it is expected to conclude by 2026 June, said Rohit Kumar Bisural, director general at Department of Railways.“As per our agreement, the feasibility study of the cross border railway should be completed by 2026 June. There are various studies on the ground. Nepali engineers and technical staff are not directly involved but they are supporting the Chinese technicians as required. There are no glitches. Once the study is complete, we will jointly write a report,” said Bisural.A joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that no tangible progress has been made in the past seven years in implementing the BRI plan and no agreement is likely anytime soon either.“This calls for consensus among the political parties as it is not just a matter of the government or one party,” said the joint-secretary. “The BRI is unlikely to move forward in Nepal anytime soon because there is no discussion, consultation and consensus among the major parties.”Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, former foreign minister and Nepal’s ex-ambassador to China, said many leaders and officials have blamed high-interest loans for not taking the BRI forward but that is not the reason.“We do not complete projects on time. If we did, we could easily pay back the loan and interest to China and other lending countries. Our leaders also fear the reaction of other countries [to accepting any kind of Chinese help],” said Pandey.“We have ‘fear psychosis’ while taking economic support,” he said. “Nepalis are scared that India, China or the United States will be angry if the country takes support from any one of them.” “We have to accept foreign support by taking neighbours and major powers into confidence,” Pandey said. ","summary":"Sunday marked the seventh year of the signing of the Belt and Road Initiative between Nepal and China yet the two sides are still struggling to finalise the implementation plan of the BRI that China proposed in early 2020.Nepal and China signed a memorandum of understanding on the One Belt One Road, later known as BRI, a flagship initiative of Chinese President Xi Jinping, on May 12, 2017, subject to renewal every three years.Still, there is a divergence of views on whether Nepal needs a dedicated BRI implementation plan to execute the projects under the Chinese initiative, senior government leaders and officials told the Post. Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled “Implementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Nepal” is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime minister’s office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the plan’s signing.“It is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,” Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.“The country’s economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,” said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the “Silkroad Roadster” in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.“When the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime minister’s trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an ‘appropriate’ time,” former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. “We also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.”The Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The document’s sub-section 12 titled ‘Other Areas’ under section 3 named ‘Cooperation Priorities’ mentions that “the two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperation”.It also says “the two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster management”.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority. In every high-level visit and meeting between Nepal and China, the initiative gets traction.Although there is no clear provision on whether the two sides should renew the agreement by exchanging correspondence, officials at the finance ministry said that would be the diplomatically correct way to go about it.There are concerns over the BRI’s stalled momentum in Nepal. The initiative’s stated focus is connectivity, trade, development strategies, and policy dialogues for cooperation in the fields of economy, environment, technology and culture.The agreement also aims to facilitate transit transport, logistics, transport network security and related infrastructure development through joint study and promote cross-border projects including railway, road, civil aviation, power grid, information and communication. The MoU also states that the two sides would conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement shortly and, if viable, start negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement to open up more markets and expand bilateral trade.Other stated areas of agreed cooperation are establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones at the existing ports, and improving the investment landscape with a view to developing mega projects in the areas of power generation, water conservation, road, railway line, cross-border transmission line, information and communication technology and infrastructure, besides customs and quarantine.Nepal also had a shaky position on the BRI in the past. After signing the deal in 2017, the government formed two committees headed by the foreign and finance secretaries to negotiate with China on the projects selected under the initiative. The finance secretary was tasked with project selection.As per the Cabinet’s mandate, the finance secretary-led committee picked 35 projects to be funded under the BRI. Then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli read out this list during his meeting with Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. Later, the Chinese side urged Kathmandu to cut the number of projects to a single digit, whereupon the list was pared down to nine projects.A former finance ministry official who was involved in several negotiations with the Chinese side said most of the nine projects were related to connectivity and infrastructure. In 2019, during the second BRI Conference in China, its outcome document listed Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network under the BRI. (Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari had attended the conference.) Then, when Chinese President Xi visited Kathmandu in October 2019, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation under the BRI.They agreed “to intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network with a view to significantly contributing to Nepal’s development agenda of graduating from a Least Developed Country,” according to a joint statement issued after Xi’s visit to Kathmandu.The Chinese side was keen to carry out the feasibility study of Kerung-Kathmandu railway under the BRI, the former finance ministry official said. “But we have shifting priorities on selecting and negotiating other projects.”The feasibility study of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway has already begun with a Chinese grant and it is expected to conclude by 2026 June, said Rohit Kumar Bisural, director general at Department of Railways.“As per our agreement, the feasibility study of the cross border railway should be completed by 2026 June.

Released in 2023, this work offers an in-depth analysis of the profound transformations shaping our understanding of self and our role in a rapidly evolving world dominated by technological progress and ubiquitous data. In today’s world, where problems like extreme nationalism and strict populist leaders are growing, leading to harsh restrictions on media freedom, her views are more important than ever.Navigating the intricate intersections of philosophy, science, and culture, her insights illuminate the present moment and offer guidance for navigating future uncertainties.The Posthuman ContextFerrando explores the idea of the posthuman, which questions and goes beyond traditional humanist beliefs. In the introduction, she explains posthumanism as a comprehensive way to understand existence beyond the human-centred perspective that has traditionally shaped philosophy.The writer argues that in the 21st century, understanding our identity means recognising our deep connection with technology, nature, and other species. This view effectively breaks down the strict divisions traditionally defining human life, like human versus machine and natural versus artificial.Ferrando argues that today's world, influenced by the Anthropocene epoch, global health crises, and the rise of artificial intelligence, requires a new way of understanding identity and existence. The Anthropocene epoch, a proposed geological period marked by significant human impact on Earth's climate, ecosystems, and geology through changes like climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and land use alterations, is especially important to her.Her work goes beyond academic study, strongly calling us to adopt a more interconnected and comprehensive view of our place in the world.Human Rights and Ethical ConsiderationsFerrando also critiques traditional human rights frameworks, pointing out their Western-centric origins and their failure to address the complex realities of a posthuman era. She calls for a shift towards a more inclusive idea of rights that includes not just humans but also technological entities and the environment. This broader perspective is essential for dealing with the ethical challenges of our time, especially regarding digital freedom and privacy.She emphasises the interconnectedness of all beings and systems, advocating for a worldview that recognises the rights and autonomy of non-human entities. This new rights framework is crucial in the context of media freedom, where information manipulation and digital platform regulation have significant impacts.Existential Dignity and AgencyAt the heart of Ferrando’s argument is the concept of ‘existential dignity’, which she defines as the intrinsic value that all beings possess due to their ability to exist and interact meaningfully with their environment. This idea is particularly important in the context of media suppression and the widespread use of surveillance technologies.Ferrando argues that dignity is threatened when individuals' data is manipulated in ways that go against their fundamental beliefs and agency. She believes that turning human experiences into commodities, as seen in surveillance capitalism, undermines the basic dignity of both individuals and communities.She broadens her exploration of existential dignity to include technological entities and artificial intelligence. Ferrando examines the ethical challenges of integrating AI and robotics into society while preserving the dignity of both humans and non-human entities. This issue is crucial as AI and machine learning advance quickly, often faster than the development of ethical guidelines and regulations.Technological Enhancement and Ethical FuturesIn her exploration of technological advancement, Ferrando examines the complex areas of biohacking, genetic engineering, and AI. She discusses both the potential benefits, such as enhanced abilities and longer lifespans and the ethical and existential risks associated with these innovations.Ferrando's critique becomes particularly relevant where technological advancements can be used to consolidate authority. The use of AI for surveillance and manipulation has the potential to amplify existing power imbalances, threatening democratic principles. In response, she calls for an ethical framework based on transparency, accountability, and the protection of individual rights in the face of rapid technological progress.Posthumanism as Social WisdomThroughout her book, Ferrando emphasises the need to translate academic philosophy into practical social wisdom. She contends that posthumanism provides a route to a more inclusive and ethical future, one that acknowledges and respects the interconnectedness of all beings. This transformation is essential for tackling the existential challenges of our era, ranging from ecological crises to the erosion of privacy and media freedom.‘The Art of Being Posthuman’ delves into the depths of identity, technology, and ethics in our modern era, offering profound insights against the backdrop of escalating media censorship and omnipresent surveillance. Her revelations illuminate the intricate relationship between humanity and technology. Her impassioned plea for a complete overhaul of human rights and ethical data practices resonates with urgency. She emphasises the critical role of media freedom in fostering a more inclusive and equitable society.A free press acts as a watchdog that holds leaders accountable for corruption and abuses. By providing diverse perspectives, a free press empowers citizens to challenge the regime's narrative, disrupting the dictator's ability to control information flow and shape public opinion. Consequently, dictators resort to censorship, intimidation, and violence to suppress dissent and maintain control.From the vantage point of posthumanism, media freedom is crucial for navigating our interconnected world, transcending traditional human-centric perspectives and acknowledging the interconnectedness of all beings, including technological entities and the environment. It amplifies diverse voices, challenges power structures, and fosters collaboration across human and non-human realms. Ferrando's call for a holistic and inclusive approach to posthumanism envisions a future where dignity, agency, and interconnectedness shape ethical considerations, making ‘The Art of Being Posthuman’ essential reading for anyone grappling with human identity and freedom in the digital age.The Art of Being PosthumanAuthor: Francesca FerrandoYear: 2023Publisher: Polity ","summary":"New York University Professor Francesca Ferrando’s latest book, ‘The Art of Being Posthuman’, explores the complex dynamics between identity, technology, and ethics in contemporary society.

This prompted Dahal and Oli to meet Nepal on Friday to discuss the matter.On Thursday, Prime Minister Dahal called on Jhala Nath Khanal, another senior leader of Unified Socialist, and discussed the possibility of the Nepal faction lending support to the main opposition in pursuit of a more advantageous deal.But, according to Khanal, he assured the prime minister that his party would remain within the present ruling alliance and had no intention of quitting the government. The Unified Socialist has two ministers in the federal Cabinet and the party played a crucial role in forming governments in Sudurpaschim and Koshi provinces as well now both Dahal and Oli are looking for similar kinds of support from the party to form a new government in the Madhesh province.But Nepal’s party has its own grievances. “The UML is not cooperating with our chief minister in Sudurpaschim,” said Jagannath Khatiwada, spokesperson of the Unified Socialist. “And, they have not bothered to ask us for our ministerial nominees for the new Koshi Cabinet.” Dirgha Sodari of Unified Socialist is the chief minister of Sudurpaschim, but the UML has not provided him its list of ministerial candidates. While in the Koshi province, Chief Minister Hikmat Karki has not reached out to the UML for the Unified Socialist for ministerial nominations, according to party sources.On Wednesday, opposition parties sought support from Nepal to ensure the continuity of the sitting chief minister Saroj Yadav of the Janata Samajbadi Party in Madhesh Province. “Both Dahal and Oli feared that we might extend support to Yadav,” Khatiwada said.Khatiwada expressed dissatisfaction with the ruling coalition saying, “Although we are in the federal coalition, we are not consulted before taking any decision.”During a meeting of the party’s parliamentary committee on Friday, the prime minister claimed that Nepal had consulted him before attending the meeting with opposition parties.“Nepalji is very much with us, and there is no chance of any change in the coalition,” Dahal said at the meeting. However, UML has taken serious objection to Nepal’s participation in the meeting of the opposition parties. The UML’s concern seems valid as Nepal in recent weeks has been publicly airing his dissatisfaction against the government and the coalition over “continued neglect” of his party by the ruling coalition leaders.According to a leader of the Maoist Centre, Oli expressed his reservations over Nepal’s participation in the meeting of the opposition parties. “It does not look good,” Oli said to Nepal during their meeting on Friday, according to a UML source. “While you are part of the government, you are also participating in opposition party meetings. This is objectionable.”Opposition parties are waiting for the Supreme Court’s verdict regarding the split of Upendra Yadav’s Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal. The party was part of the government, but after the division, a faction led by Ashok Rai is the government and the other faction led by Upendra Yadav is not. Yadav challenged the legality of the split in the court. During the Maoist Centre’s parliamentary party meeting on Friday, Nepal’s participation in the opposition parties' meeting was one of the topics of discussion, and some lawmakers wanted to hear from the prime minister about Nepal's potential move, according to a Maoist Centre leader. “Nepalji had informed me before participating in the meeting of the opposition parties. Do not have doubts about the stability of the government, it is very much intact. He did not attend the meeting to join the opposition alliance,” Dahal said in the party’s meeting, although his remarks raised concerns about the future of the current ruling alliance. Recently, the prime minister secured a vote of confidence with comfortable support. Despite this, he felt the need to reassure his party leaders that the government remains stable and no one is going to unseat him anytime soon. Barely hours after making this claim, Dahal, joined by Oli held a meeting with Nepal at the prime minister’s office and sought his assurance in forming a new government in the Madhesh province.But the Unified Socialist has yet to take a formal decision on whether to support the opposition’s candidate, current chief minister Yadav, or the federal coalition’s candidate from CK Raut’s Janamat Party. Raut’s party is eying the post with support from CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre.“It’s all about give-and-take and bargaining,” said Khatiwada, adding, “If we get credible assurances from the prime minister and Oli that they will provide full support and cooperation at both the centre and provinces, then we will support the process of forming the new government in Madhesh province.” ","summary":"The current political equation is experiencing turbulence from the provincial to central level, and managing dissatisfaction within ruling parties has become a Herculean task for Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and KP Sharma Oli, the UML chair and key architect of the ruling coalition.After Madhav Kumar Nepal, the chair of the coalition member CPN (Unified Socialist), joined a meeting of opposition parties on Wednesday called by the main opposition Nepali Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba, it sent shockwaves through the ruling coalition.

The Unified Socialist has two ministers in the federal Cabinet and the party played a crucial role in forming governments in Sudurpaschim and Koshi provinces as well now both Dahal and Oli are looking for similar kinds of support from the party to form a new government in the Madhesh province.But Nepal’s party has its own grievances. “The UML is not cooperating with our chief minister in Sudurpaschim,” said Jagannath Khatiwada, spokesperson of the Unified Socialist. “And, they have not bothered to ask us for our ministerial nominees for the new Koshi Cabinet.” Dirgha Sodari of Unified Socialist is the chief minister of Sudurpaschim, but the UML has not provided him its list of ministerial candidates. While in the Koshi province, Chief Minister Hikmat Karki has not reached out to the UML for the Unified Socialist for ministerial nominations, according to party sources.On Wednesday, opposition parties sought support from Nepal to ensure the continuity of the sitting chief minister Saroj Yadav of the Janata Samajbadi Party in Madhesh Province. “Both Dahal and Oli feared that we might extend support to Yadav,” Khatiwada said.Khatiwada expressed dissatisfaction with the ruling coalition saying, “Although we are in the federal coalition, we are not consulted before taking any decision.”During a meeting of the party’s parliamentary committee on Friday, the prime minister claimed that Nepal had consulted him before attending the meeting with opposition parties.“Nepalji is very much with us, and there is no chance of any change in the coalition,” Dahal said at the meeting. However, UML has taken serious objection to Nepal’s participation in the meeting of the opposition parties. The UML’s concern seems valid as Nepal in recent weeks has been publicly airing his dissatisfaction against the government and the coalition over “continued neglect” of his party by the ruling coalition leaders.According to a leader of the Maoist Centre, Oli expressed his reservations over Nepal’s participation in the meeting of the opposition parties. “It does not look good,” Oli said to Nepal during their meeting on Friday, according to a UML source. “While you are part of the government, you are also participating in opposition party meetings. This is objectionable.”Opposition parties are waiting for the Supreme Court’s verdict regarding the split of Upendra Yadav’s Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal. The party was part of the government, but after the division, a faction led by Ashok Rai is the government and the other faction led by Upendra Yadav is not. Yadav challenged the legality of the split in the court. During the Maoist Centre’s parliamentary party meeting on Friday, Nepal’s participation in the opposition parties' meeting was one of the topics of discussion, and some lawmakers wanted to hear from the prime minister about Nepal's potential move, according to a Maoist Centre leader. “Nepalji had informed me before participating in the meeting of the opposition parties. Do not have doubts about the stability of the government, it is very much intact. He did not attend the meeting to join the opposition alliance,” Dahal said in the party’s meeting, although his remarks raised concerns about the future of the current ruling alliance. Recently, the prime minister secured a vote of confidence with comfortable support. Despite this, he felt the need to reassure his party leaders that the government remains stable and no one is going to unseat him anytime soon. Barely hours after making this claim, Dahal, joined by Oli held a meeting with Nepal at the prime minister’s office and sought his assurance in forming a new government in the Madhesh province.But the Unified Socialist has yet to take a formal decision on whether to support the opposition’s candidate, current chief minister Yadav, or the federal coalition’s candidate from CK Raut’s Janamat Party. Raut’s party is eying the post with support from CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre.“It’s all about give-and-take and bargaining,” said Khatiwada, adding, “If we get credible assurances from the prime minister and Oli that they will provide full support and cooperation at both the centre and provinces, then we will support the process of forming the new government in Madhesh province.” "},{"hash":"ed97d2c1fdb567f27814407d7470f660ee01baadf4dbc0069469fbaac780a887","title":"is-khanal-prevailing-over-nepal-in-unified-socialist","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/05/31/is-khanal-prevailing-over-nepal-in-unified-socialist","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/thumb8-1717114644.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1717113600000,"source":"kp","category":"politics","content":"Separate meetings of two top leaders of the CPN (Unified Socialist) with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Nepali Congress leader Sher Bahadur Deuba have sparked a debate again whether the new party was divided along factional lines under Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal.Former prime minister Khanal met Dahal on Thursday while the party chair, Madhav Nepal, attended a meeting of opposition parties on Wednesday convened by the main opposition leader Deuba. The meeting held at Deuba’s residence in Budhanilkantha was aimed at realigning the coalition for the Madhesh provincial government.The Madhesh government, led by Upendra Yadav’s Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, has been reduced to a minority after the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) withdrew their support to the provincial government.Senior leader Khanal is believed to have played a role in keeping the party within the present coalition, despite efforts from the party chair Nepal and other leaders to change the coalition.During their 45-minute meeting on Thursday, Prime Minister Dahal and Khanal discussed ongoing political developments, including strategies to give continuity to the leftist alliance in the federal and provincial governments, states a press note released by Khanal’s secretariat.Following the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Unified Socialist leader Khanal, the prime minister also spoke to Unified Socialist chair Nepal. “I talked to Madhav Nepal this morning. He won’t join any other alliance and he is not out of this coalition,” Prime Minister Dahal said while talking to media persons at the Biratnagar airport. Dahal added that he believed the Unified Socialist won’t change the ruling coalition at the federal as well as provincial levels.“Our party backs the present coalition, and we are not likely to change the coalition anytime soon,” said Minister for Federal Affairs and General Administration Bhanu Bhakta Joshi of the Unified Socialist. “From the centre to the provincial level, our party has not considered changing the coalition,” Joshi told the Post. On Wednesday, Congress chief Deuba invited Janata Samajbadi Nepal chair Yadav, who recently left the Dahal government, Loktantrik Samajbadi Party chair Mahantha Thakur and Unified Socialist chair Nepal to his residence to discuss the politics of Madhesh.Saroj Kumar Yadav of the JSP Nepal is the incumbent chief minister of Madhesh. However, he lost the majority in the assembly after the UML and the Maoist Centre withdrew their support to the Yadav government on May 12. After the Janata Samajbadi Nepal pulled the plug on the Dahal government in Kathmandu, the major ruling partners also withdrew their support to the Madhesh provincial government.As per Article 168 (4) of the constitution, the chief minister must prove his majority in the Provincial Assembly within 30 days after a coalition partner withdraws support. Yadav constitutionally has to go for the floor test by June 12 but he is set to do that on June 5.“The Congress and the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal sought the support of our party in Madhesh Province at the Wednesday meeting,” Rajendra Pandey, vice-chair of the Unified Socialist, told the Post. “Our party has not decided on the matter, as the day for the floor test is yet to come.” The opposition parties can secure a majority in Madhesh Province if the Unified Socialist gives the trust vote to Yadav, the chief minister.Meanwhile, a meeting of UML, Maoist Centre and Janamat Party leaders in Janakpur on Thursday reached an agreement to form the provincial government led by a Janamat member. According to the agreement, the Unified Socialist and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party have also agreed to join the coalition in the province. Saroj Kumar Yadav of the UML, Bharat Prasad Sah of the Maoist Centre and Mahesh Prasad Yadav of Janamat Party have signed the agreement but no leaders from the Unified Socialist and Loktantrik Samajbadi have put their signatures on it.The UML is the largest party in the province with 24 seats (excluding the Speaker), the Congress has 22, JSP-Nepal 19, Janamat Party 13, Loktantrik Samajbadi 9, Maoist Centre 9, Unified Socialist 7, Sanghiya Samajbadi 1, Nagarik Unmukti 1, and Rastriya Prajatantra Party 1.In the 107-seat assembly, the UML, the Maoist Centre and the CK Raut-led Janamat alone can’t secure a majority.Notably, the Upendra Yadav-led JSP-Nepal is the only party that has got an opportunity to lead a provincial government continuously after the 2017 elections that first formed the provincial legislature. Lalbabu Raut of Yadav’s party remained the chief minister of Madhesh for the full five-year term in the earlier tenure.After the meeting on Wednesday, Unified Socialist Chief Whip in federal parliament Metmani Chaudhary told the Post that his party would support the Madhesh government to foil the attempts of the ruling parties to change the political equation in Janakpur.“We agreed to foil attempts by the ruling parties [in Kathmandu] to oust the present government in Madhesh,” said Chaudhary. “We will extend our support to the Yadav-led government.”But the party changed its position within hours after senior leader Khanal met Prime Minister Dahal. Though Nepal is the party chair, Khanal often prevails in the party’s decisions, if the recent decisions are anything to go by.Earlier, too, when Unified Socialist chair Nepal decided to join the opposition camp led by the Congress to constitute the government in Sudurpaschim, Khanal had reached out to Prime Minister Dahal which ultimately foiled the plan to side with the Congress-led alliance there.However, Pandey, the party vice-chair, claimed that Nepal, as the party chief, has the authority to make decisions. Pandey also claims that such a decision comes after a discussion in the party.“Sometimes Khanal, the senior leader, might feel that he is the one who takes party decisions, this is just his illusion,” Pandey told the Post.Pandey termed Khanal’s meeting with the prime minister and pressurising the party to change its decision as unacceptable.Is a senior leader of the party prevailing over the party chair?Replying to the question raised by the Post, Khanal said, “If someone takes the unfolding of the events in that way, I have nothing much to say, but I believe our party should continue the present ruling coalition without if and buts.”Khanal also said that, as a communist leader who fought to advance the communist movement in Nepal, he will do everything to make the communist party strong. The Unified Socialist is holding its general convention from June 30 to July 4. Nepal and Khanal are likely to face each other for the party’s top post at the convention.After the UML and the Maoist Centre, the major ruling partners, decided to support the Nagarik Unmukti Party in Sudurpaschim, the Unified Socialist decided to change the camp. A meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Khanal also led to the appointment of Dirgharaj Sodari as the chief minister. Assembly party leader of the Unified Socialist, Sodari was appointed to the post on April 18 despite serious reservations from the UML.Sodari won the confidence motion in the provincial assembly on May 15 but the UML and the Maoist Centre have yet to join the Cabinet. A month after its formation, the Sodari Cabinet has yet to get full shape. Federal Minister for Industry Commerce and Supplies Damodar Bhandari on Thursday criticised the party for its unstable policy. Bhandari, a minister from the UML, accused Unified Socialist chair Nepal, saying, “Due to the dubious role played by the Unified Socialist leadership, the Sudurpaschim government is unable to take full shape.”A group of UML leaders formed the Unified Socialist, led by Madhav Nepal, in 2021. But the party performed poorly in the elections held the following year at all levels. It failed to secure even the status of a national political party in the 2022 general elections.The party, which has 10 seats in the House of Representatives, has been in government for most of the 18 months since.

The Pushpa Kamal Dahal government in February last year had registered the amendment bill proposing that the six-member council nominate office-bearer candidates for constitutional bodies with the approval of its chairperson and at least half of the existing members—or four members in total. While other parties had no reservation on the bill, the UML had been demanding that a majority of the council should be allowed to make decisions, with or without the chairperson’s approval. It had stood against the provision requiring the prime minister's consent for decisions.The largest party in the ruling alliance softened its position at Thursday's meeting, leading to a unanimous decision on the bill. It changed its position as it is now in the government unlike last year when it was the main opposition.“The bill was endorsed unanimously,” said Ram Hari Khatiwada, chairperson of the committee. Now the bill will be presented in both Houses for endorsement. As the lower house panel endorsed it unanimously, it is most likely to be endorsed in the ongoing session of Parliament.As per the Constitution of Nepal, the council is headed by the prime minister. The chief justice, Speaker of the House, National Assembly chair, leader of the main opposition and deputy Speaker are its members. The Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs takes the seat when the council nominates a candidate for chief justice.A clause in the bill says the council meets to take decisions unanimously. If that is not possible, “the meeting shall be deemed to have the required strength if the chairperson and at least 50 percent of the members are present,” reads the amendment bill.Currently, the chairperson and four members of the council must be present to convene its meeting. However, a majority of the total can take the decision if there is no unanimity. If the present bill is endorsed the prime minister's consent is necessary including an agreement of 50 percent of the remaining members for the decision. In the six-member council, the prime minister and the National Assembly chair Narayan Dahal come from CPN (Maoist Centre).

As many as 52 persons were appointed chairpersons and members of various constitutional bodies based on the recommendations of the Oli-led council while Ganesh Timilsina, then chair of the upper house, and then chief justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana lent their support.

People cannot be forced to follow the home minister’s irrational directions,” said Raju Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer. “Respective committee of the House, National Human Rights Commission and other concerned agencies should take note of this decision and direct the concerned agencies to stop ruling people at individual whims.” "},{"hash":"b2437276a7ec0464949472355e8fc16c68e2a132970ab24f57d1e0595b2339da","title":"in-kathmandu-more-than-7-000-children-aged-six-to-eight-years-are-out-of-school","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/kathmandu/2024/05/27/in-kathmandu-more-than-7-000-children-aged-six-to-eight-years-are-out-of-school","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/Screenshot20240527070459-1716772855.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1716768000000,"source":"kp","category":"kathmandu","content":"Over 7,000 children between six and eight years of age are out of school in the Kathmandu district and could miss the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in the ongoing immunisation drive, health authorities estimate.Officials said they only have an estimation of the number of children in that age bracket but do not know their whereabouts.“Children in the floating population, of parents working in construction sectors and factories or of those residing in slum settlements, who do not go to school, are the high-risk groups but they could be deprived of the vaccination programme,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu.“We will run a vaccination programme in health facilities on the last day of the campaign, but we are unsure if all the children missing the vaccine will get inoculated.”The Ministry of Health and Population launched a nationwide immunisation drive on Sunday, targeting over 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 who have missed the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) due to a global shortage. Those children were administered only Type-1 and Type-3 polio oral vaccines and had missed the Type-2 polio vaccine.Officials at the Immunisation Section of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services estimated that thousands of children throughout the country neither go to school nor participate in health care programmes.“Providing health care services, including routine vaccines, to those populations is the most challenging task,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, the section chief. “Chances of those groups missing the services, including the routine vaccines, are always there. We will send health workers to the at-risk areas to find such children.”Healthworkers found over 74,000 children out of school nationwide during the measles-rubella campaign launched in February. “We are aware of the children who are out of school,” said Gautam. “Floating population, scattered slums, working-class people, lack of awareness and poor access to health workers are major challenges to health workers. We will send health workers to the areas designated as risk zones.”Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but the World Health Organisation officially gave the status on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV). The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus. The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus. However, the Type-2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in South Asia to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Health officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.The government's number one priority is childhood immunisation, under which 13 types of vaccines are given free of charge against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis, and typhoid, under the regular immunisation programme.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.However, the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all. This figure was one percent in 2016. The Ministry of Health and Population said that the nationwide vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 percent.

This is considered an epidemic season, in which hundreds of thousands of people get infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases and snakebites.“Over six to eight snakebite victims seek treatment in our hospital daily,” said Dr Bimal Sharma Chalise of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “Number of patients seeking snakebite treatment has gone up after a rise in rainfall activities.”Along with water-borne and vector-borne diseases, snakebites and resulting deaths are common in Nepal during the rainy season.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snake bites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Along with snakebite cases,the number of patients infected with diarrheal ailments, fever and jaundice has also risen in the hospital.“Most of the snakebite victims seeking care at our hospital are either from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from the districts adjoining the Valley,” said Chalise. “Most of the snakebite victims are farmers, women and children who work or play in the fields or go to the jungle to collect fodder for their cattle.”Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health issue usually triggered by food and water safety or hygiene issues. The disease, which has been associated with higher temperatures, is one of Nepal’s leading causes of morbidity and mortality.Doctors at the hospital say around half a dozen diarrheal patients are also seeking treatment every day. Similarly, patients having jaundice and fever due to typhoid are also seeking care at the hospital.Typhoid fever, usually called typhoid, is a highly contagious disease caused by Salmonella typhi, which spreads through contaminated food or water. Studies have shown that the disease can be fatal in up to 10 percent of the reported cases.Typhoid fever has been found throughout the world, but the problem is acute in areas without safe drinking water and sanitation. Nepal has also recorded major typhoid outbreaks in the past, but very few cases have been reported in the last few years.Nepal introduced the typhoid vaccine in the routine vaccination programme in 2022.The Ministry of Health and Population launched a month-long nationwide vaccination campaign against typhoid, during which around seven million children between the ages of 15 months and 15 years were inoculated.“Cases of water-borne diseases and snakebite have started to spike of late,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Hospital. “We should all be cautious about the food and water we eat and drink. We must ensure that food and water is safe before eating.”Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive against the risks. They say that people living in thatched-roof houses are also highly vulnerable to snakebite, as snakes visit such homes in search of rats. They say that people should be asked to keep their houses and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in the bush, avoid walking at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.“Most of the water resources get contaminated during monsoon season, as rainwater gets mixed in the water resources,” Pun said.

The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus. The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus. However, the Type -2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in the South Asia region to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN Health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Gautam said that due to global shortages of the IPV vaccine, children born between April 13, 2016, and October 18, 2018, were inoculated only with the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine.“Children who missed the IPV vaccine will be at high risk of poliovirus infection,” warned Gautam. “So we are launching a campaign to inoculate them.”Health Officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.Childhood immunisation is the number one priority of the government, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, however, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all.

The same vector also spreads elephantiasis or filariasis and Japanese encephalitis.Experts say mosquitoes become infected after feeding on infected birds, especially crows. When the infected mosquitoes bite humans and animals, they spread the virus, which can cause neurological problems and death in infected persons. India has reported a death from the West Nile virus in Kerala and six other cases of infections in Thrissur, Malappuram and Kozhikode districts in recent days. Ojha said that Nepal is a member state of the World Health Organisation and receives every alert issued under the International Health Regulations. “Nepal is in the high-risk zone for an outbreak of the West Nile Virus due to its climate, presence of virus spreading vector, and mobility of people to and from the high-risk zones,” said Ojha. At least two cases of West Nile Virus infection were reported in a study carried out in Nepal in 2009-2010. Of 2,046 serum samples tested to examine the virus, two samples contained fragments of the genome resembling virus lineage 1.Experts say there is no specific treatment for West Nile virus. They suggest drinking plenty of water and fluids, resting, and taking medicine for fever in mild cases. “Those experiencing severe headache, high fever, weakness and confusion should see the doctor at the earliest,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “As mosquito breeding season has started, one should also take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.”Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis, as multiple studies have pointed out. The United Nations’s report “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” states that at least six major vector-borne diseases affected by climate drivers have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also reveals that the warming climate has caused the Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes mosquitos to move to altitudes above 2,000 metres in Nepal. This shift in their distribution has serious implications, as over 100 species of Anopheles transmit malaria, more than 950 species of Aedes spread diseases like dengue, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile virus, and over 1,000 species of Culex transmit Japanese encephalitis, filariasis, and West Nile virus.Vector-borne diseases, or VBDs, are spread by carriers like mosquitoes, sandflies, kissing bugs, and ticks. The report says that viruses like dengue, chikungunya, and Japanese encephalitis are emerging in Nepal's hilly and mountainous areas.Experts say frequent movement of people is also a reason diseases are detected in new areas. When disease vectors bite an infected person, they transmit the disease, and the vectors’ entire generation gets infected.The Ministry of Health has reported over 1,000 cases of dengue infection since January, this year.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar.

They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market.

","summary":"Chicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution.

In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution.

During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time.

It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides.

The Rhinos also qualified for their maiden Asia Cup and ended the year by securing their ticket to the T20 World Cup for the first time since 2014.But all that steel and resilience now seem to have suddenly vanished into the thin air.The year 2024 has been a rollercoaster ride for Rohit Paudel’s Rhinos, even in their roaring and perfect hunting ground—TU Cricket Ground, Kirtipur. They opened the League 2 with a loss against Namibia which ended their 15-match winning streak at home and won only one of their four matches of the home tri-series.They also failed to qualify for the 2025 Asia Cup last month and a four-wicket defeat to less fancied side Hong Kong in the third-place playoff of the ACC Men’s T20 Premier Cup also banished them out of the 2024 ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup.One of their memorable moments came when they swept the three-match bilateral series against Canada in Kirtipur in their opening event of the year.However, their batting has been characterised by unsteadiness since and it was out in the open again against Canada in their first warm-up match of the T20 World Cup.Nepal’s bowling unit has been their strength always and proved key in the middle overs on Monday as well when they struck five times in the space of 27 deliveries limiting Canada from 111-2 in the 14th over to 135-7 in the 18th over, with Abinash Bohara taking 2-27, and Karan KC, Sompal Kami, Gulsan Jha, Lalit Rajbanshi and Sagar Dhakal all picking up one wicket each.Nicholas Kriton’s 50 runs off 39 balls and opener Navneet Dhaliwal’s 32 runs off 27 balls had driven Canada past 100 to give them a great start.Despite a tight bowling from Nepal, Ravinderpal Singh’s explosive 17-ball 41 guided Canada to 183-7.Nepal could never stay in the chase of an 184-run target.Opener Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh struggled again and departed making 10 (16) and 22 (22), respectively.Skipper Paudel has been the most consistent batter for Nepal. He was Nepal’s leading run-scorer last year with 403 T20I runs from 13 innings and was facing Canada having scored 265 runs from four innings that included a century and two half-centuries—all of which came during the five-match T20 series West Indies A.He was out for a duck in his last outing—the fifth T20 against West Indies A—and failed to make a mark again after being dismissed for one.Sundeep Jora (6), Jha (0), Kami (4), Dhakal (5) and Bohara (0) all handled the bat poorly and returned to the pavilion with single digit scores, as Nepal could not only manage 120 runs.Canada’s Dilon Heyliger returned the match figures of 4-20 in this 2.3 over spell. Jeremy Gordon and Saad Bin Zafar took two wickets each while Kaleem Sana and Pragat Singh pocketed one wicket apiece.Malla and Dipendra Singh Airee also had a golden year in 2023.During the Asian Games, Malla scored a century off just 34 balls against Mongolia. The score stands as the second fastest T20I century. Malla scored 402 runs in his 12 innings last year. After struggling with the bat most of this year, he is regaining his shape gradually at a perfect time. He top-scored against Canada with 37 runs off 30 balls, carrying his form from this last match against West Indies A where he scored a valiant 37 not out off 18 balls.Airee is Nepal’s highest run-scorer in the T20Is with 1626 runs from 56 innings. He scored a 50 off just nine balls against Mongolia last year to break the record for fastest fifty in T20s. A month ago, the big-hitting finisher smashed six sixes in an over during the Premier Cup against Qatar, joining the ranks of Yuvraj Singh and Kieron Pollard in achieving the rare feat in men’s T20I. Airee did not bat against Canada.Anil Sah’s batting does not look like a bigger concern. He was outstanding again and comfortably scored 24 runs off 16 balls. He returned to the national team for Nepal’s home series against Canada in February and immediately made an impact with a fifty and an unbeaten century. Although he lost his form following the Canada series win, he has refound his confidence lately.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  ","summary":"Gyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions.

They blame the constitution for the government’s instability, and then the instability for the deepening despondency in the country. They argue stability is possible only if we have a one-party government. However, with a constitutional provision for proportional representation, no party can win a parliamentary majority, making a one-party government impossible. The politicians claim they have no option but to form a coalition government, but coalitions are inherently unstable. The only way to a stable, one-party government is to eliminate the provision of proportional representation. Experience elsewhere shows that a multi-party coalition has little to do with government instability. A government becomes unstable when those responsible for implementing the constitution do not respect the constitutional spirit. Coalition and instabilityMost of Europe has long been governed by coalition governments. Take Germany, for example. Since the establishment of the Federal Republic in 1949, Germany has had a single-party government only once, from 1957 to 1961. All others have been in stable coalitions, which have turned the country into Europe’s economic powerhouse over the years. Germany also uses a mixed first-past-the-post and proportional electoral system. Every voter has two votes: One for the constituency candidate and the other for a political party. The proportional system has not been a handicap for stable governments. Israel has never had a single-party government. Despite the never-ending series of coalition governments, the country has done well economically and militarily. Manmohan Singh ruled India for 10 years as the head of a coalition of several parties. His government is credited with a breakthrough in India’s economy, catapulting the country to the world stage. As a coalition government is not a recipe for instability, a single-party government is not a prerequisite for stability and economic progress. North Korea has had a stable single-party government for a long time. It is an economic basket case. Our own partyless Panchayat regime ensured political stability for 30 years. Yet, all we have from those is the 1,000-km East-West highway and a few factories, all built with foreign aid. Additionally, a single-party majority in the parliament comes with serious risks when the party's leader abuses the constitution to further their ego and personal ambitions. Adolf Hitler came to power using democratic means. Recep Erdogan of Turkey and Victor Orbán of Hungary are recent examples. They have used their majorities in their respective parliaments to muzzle the media and undermine the judiciary; in short, they undermine democracy. Under Narendra Modi’s single-party rule, India’s free media—once a shining light of the Indian democracy—has been bent to serve Modi’s ambitions. The country’s much-vaunted judiciary is compromised; opposition leaders are routinely thrown behind bars; Muslims, who comprise 14 percent of the population, have been marginalised, and secularism is under threat.Instability and political leadersIn the past 76 years, Nepal has written seven constitutions (including the Interim Acts of 1948 and 1951) and trashed six because they did not work. Instead of blaming the constitution for government instability, we should ask why our constitutions have not worked. The conversation between the two prominent politicians, Rishikesh Shah and BP Koirala, in 1968, soon after BP's release from Sundarijal, may provide an answer. I happened to be standing behind the two when they were talking. Shah argued that a flaw in the constitution—an obscure clause which vested emergency powers in the King—allowed King Mahendra to arrest BP and dissolve the parliament. Koirala responded, “Shahji! No constitution is perfect. If those responsible for implementing the constitution have respect for its spirit, nothing like what the King did would have happened”. “You know, Professor,” BP continued, “According to the Constitution of the Soviet Union (The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics), all Republics in the Union had full independence to secede, should they decide to do so. Yet, the Soviets sent their tanks even to independent countries like Hungary and Czechoslovakia when they challenged Moscow's grip on their countries. The British Monarch has several emergency powers, including dissolving parliament, but he does not now exercise them. Clearly, to the Soviets in Moscow, the constitution is just a piece of paper; to British monarchs, precedent, established democratic norms, and tradition are not to be violated”. Democracy and government stability are ensured only when the leaders are honourable and operate with high ethical and moral standards, respecting the spirit of the constitution and established democratic norms. This includes ensuring that the parliament functions properly.We buried the 1990 constitution and ushered in a new one in 2015 but not the political leaders responsible for implementing it. We failed to recognise that changing the constitution does not change the behaviour of leaders whose focus is to enrich themselves and their party. The trio of Sher Bahadur Deuba, KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal is still in command, and their manners have not changed. It is not the constitution but the non-stop jostling for political power among the trio that causes frequent blocking of Parliament and government instability. Some parts of the constitution require more clarity and consistency, but dropping the provision for proportional representation is not one of them.

But that could reflect our failure to imagine two states whose purpose is to bring the two people closer, not to ensure their strict separation.– Project Syndicate "},{"hash":"f563326f63b5d3467d87812b9c3fd264b856bb295e50348f339fe65dfa780a53","title":"eerie-silence","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/05/29/eerie-silence","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2019/third-party/thumb4-1717027018.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1716940800000,"source":"kp","category":"editorial","content":"Media publisher Sirohiya, arrested by the police on orders of Home Minister Lamichhane, has been released after nine days.

The party has done poorly in all elections since its establishment. It has also failed in service delivery despite continuously being in the government since its inception. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal caught up with the party’s General Secretary, Ghanashyam Bhusal, for insights about the Unified Socialist’s upcoming general convention and broader political dynamics. Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer?Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation. After Oli’s election as the party leader, policy issues were undermined. In fact, we were at odds because of the policy issues.What were those policy disputes?We [our faction] believed that after the establishment of democratic republic system, the fight for a political system was almost over as this is the most progressive political system of our time. We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party. The new party was confused about the way forward. The upcoming general convention will formulate clear policies in this connection. What about the leadership? Will the party get new leadership?For the past two decades, I have been advocating that a communist party should adopt the right programmes to bring about social changes. At the time, the Maoists had a policy of seizing state power through force, and the UML was talking only about transforming society through elections. But the UML was basically engaged only in winning elections. In this context, we [a group of UML leaders] came up with some policies that would make substantive changes in such ritualistic practices.Now, I have been saying that our party should be led by a leader who can internalise and effectively implement those policies. We have almost finalised the party’s policy documents. When the documents are circulated among party workers, the debate about who is eligible to implement these policies will start.You often claim to be the proponent of the CPN (Unified Socialist)’s party line. If so, will you claim party leadership to implement those policies?The first condition to become the party leader is that he/she should internalise the policies and programmes adopted by the party. I shouldn’t say that no one besides me has internalised them. It is true that I have been actively leading the debates and discussions to introduce new policies in the party. Party representatives will debate and decide this at the convention.A large number of senior leaders quit the UML to form this party. But it couldn’t even retain its members let alone further expand.There was a need for radical reforms and restructuring in communist organisations and their policies. This should have been done by the country’s largest communist party—the CPN-UML. But the party leadership and its rank and file didn’t realise the need for it. There was no serious policy discussion in the UML. While the leadership of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and its organisation are oriented in the right direction, it’s not properly trained for such restructuring. Therefore, many even accused the party leadership of being just a follower and subservient to the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre. Various sections of society who had praised us for standing against Oli’s wrong decision didn’t appreciate other political moves of our party. Parliament dissolution was a political event. A party needs clear programmes and agenda to keep public support. Unfortunately, we were found wanting in this regard. We should have done something in job creation and increasing production. We will make such things clear at the upcoming convention. Since its formation, the party has been constantly bickered over power sharing with other parties and even party leaders always seem to be wrangling for ministerial berths. Don’t you think such activities weaken the party?This happened as the party lacked clear policies to move ahead. Standing against Oli became sort of its policy as there was deep resentment against him. As far as the leaders’ attachment to power is concerned, the party was born out of power [from Parliament, not from the ground]. So the struggle for power is linked to its genesis. It has been in power ever since its establishment. These allegations were hence natural, and the party leadership couldn’t clarify things. We couldn’t show what we did for the betterment of the society.Party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and other top leader Jhalanath Khanal seem to be working at cross-purposes. Nepal seems closer to the Congress while Khanal has been consistently lobbying for an alliance with the UML and the Maoist Centre.We have almost resolved this issue in the course of finalising the party’s policy document. Our conclusion is that, in general, the Congress mainly represents neoliberals and comprador capitalists. When we lobby for the country’s independent economic policy, the Congress may not agree. The party tilts more towards pro-western ideas in the name of liberalism. We in our party are in consensus that in the long-run we will compete against the Congress. But we shouldn’t forget that we got the current democratic system and the constitution only after fighting jointly with the Congress. So we have to keep our doors open for collaboration with the Congress in order to safeguard this system and the constitution. It is also historically proven that the Congress and left forces should stand together to safeguard democratic system. Thus we have now made our theoretical standing clearer.But in practical aspects, as you said, there are some differences. Party chair doesn’t want to increase distance with the Congress as he worked closely with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and other leaders to fight Oli ji. But Jhalanath Khanal ji is for left alliance.While there are already major communist forces such as the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, why is one more communist force, CPN (Unified Socialist), needed? How do you prove your relevance?The CPN-UML didn’t follow the right policies, even those endorsed by its general conventions. Party chief Oli wants total control of the party organisation, from the centre to the local units. The entire party is mobilised mainly to realise Oli’s personal ambitions. This party can’t work in favour of the society in the long run. The Maoist Centre hasn’t succeeded in transforming itself from war-era rigidity of Maoism. The Unified Socialist is here to correct these two major deviations of Nepal’s communist movement. Had the party raised this issue prominently right since its formation, people would have understood its relevance. We will do it now. This convention will be a landmark event in this connection as well. Many people think that the Unified Socialist will ultimately merge with the UML.Merger is not a solution. Even if you want to bring two parties together, you have to unify them. A merger brings top leaders together based on power sharing, just like the merger of the UML and Maoist Centre in 2018. Such a merger is guided mainly by the interests of certain leaders. That’s why the merger didn’t last. The need now is unification among communist parties based on policies and programmes. Otherwise, it will be nothing more than a gathering of leaders. There is no point in merging the party to make the UML bigger and make Oli prime minister one more time.As a leader of a ruling coalition partner, how confident are you of the stability of this alliance?Given the composition of the present Parliament, we can’t rule out the making and breaking of different coalitions until the next election. Oli ji used to talk of the Unified Socialist as a tumour removed after a surgery. His mindset that he can do anything in Nepali politics has suffered a setback. Therefore, he became ready for this coalition. If he has realised this change, this coalition will last. But if he again tries to manoeuvre to justify his dissolution of Parliament and serve any other interests, there might even be other coalitions.Why has your party been in a state of disharmony with coalition partners right from the beginning?Initially, the prime minister didn’t consult with us while making this coalition. That created misunderstanding. He eventually admitted his mistake in failing to inform us on time and sought our support. So, that chapter was closed. Now we have no issue at the party’s level, and officially, we are committed to this coalition.

Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   ","summary":"United Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal Hanaa Singer-Hamdy has worked for close to 30 years across development and humanitarian contexts in senior management and strategic leadership roles. Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   "},{"hash":"b8cf800b128e5429effac6538b5cdeff14e12e5c92d4968c239f48ce105eb283","title":"interview-with-padam-giri","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/05/05/interview-with-padam-giri","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/padamgiri-1714923097.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1714867200000,"source":"kp","category":"interviews","content":"The budget session of the federal parliament starts Friday without the resolution of the long-standing differences between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate alleged cooperative fraud charges against Rabi Lamichhane, deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs. While several bills await parliamentary approval, whether the House will function smoothly is still uncertain. The Post’s Binod Ghimire sat down with Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, to discuss the government’s plan to make the House productive and its effort to get crucial bills endorsed in the upcoming session. He is also a CPN-UML central committee member. Excerpts:The new session is starting without resolving the old deadlock. How will you ensure its smooth functioning?The Nepali Congress should revisit its demand for the formation of a parliamentary committee targeting a particular person. This is not natural. What are the problems facing the cooperative sector as a whole, which types of fraudulent acts have taken place and who is involved in those cases, however, can be studied. We can constitute a parliamentary committee or other types of panels for such study, which can even recommend actions against those involved in fraud. Why should the main opposition shy away from a detailed study of the entire cooperative sector and want to focus on a particular case and a particular person? I am hopeful the Congress being a responsible democratic party will agree on forming a panel with a broader mandate.The prime minister on Saturday said a probe committee can be formed. What kind of committee is he talking about?He is talking about a committee to study the malpractices prevalent in the cooperative sector, to identify the problems, suggest their solutions while also recommending actions against those involved in fraudulent activities. The main intent behind demanding a probe against a particular person is that once a committee is formed, the party [the Congress] will ask for his resignation. It is an ill-intended demand aimed at creating problems. Media have reported problems in several cooperatives. Would it be feasible to form separate probe committees for each incident? We are in continuous informal discussions with the main opposition and there are plans to discuss the matter formally in an all-party meeting to be held very soon.How will the budget get endorsed if Congress continues to obstruct the House in case the probe panel is not formed as per its demand?Why just probe the home minister and the cooperative where he is allegedly involved? Why not investigate the cooperatives where the leaders from the Congress or any other party might also be involved? We are hopeful that the Congress will analyse whether its demand is rational. I cannot believe it will block budget endorsement.Have you identified why the federal parliament has become so unproductive in terms of bill endorsement?The performance of the parliament is not satisfactory. Getting the bills endorsed as quickly as possible has been my priority ever since taking charge of the ministry. Three bills have been endorsed after I became the minister just two months back. Before that, only one bill had gotten through the parliament in more than one year since the present House of Representatives came into being. That was a matter of shame. Despite the UML then being the opposition party, we had raised the issue in the parliament. It is the government’s responsibility to facilitate the deliberations over the bill and their endorsement. As a law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister, it is my major responsibility to make sure the House sessions are fruitful. I am working accordingly.There are 24 bills under consideration in the federal parliament including 23 under the lower house. I am taking initiatives to get them endorsed in the forthcoming session. The amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TJ) Act, school education bill, bill to amend some Nepal Acts, amendment bill to the Banking Office and Punishment Act, among others, are our top priorities.In January your ministry had identified 109 bills that needed to be presented and endorsed. But only two of them have been registered in the parliament. Why?Our ministry has already consented to different ministries to draft 23 bills. The ministry itself is working on eight more. Several of those bills will be registered in the upcoming session.There are complaints that the bill drafting process is not consultative, which is why many of them are controversial. What is obstructing such broad discussions?I agree that the bills drafted after broad discussions are less contentious. The respective ministries should ensure maximum engagement in the drafting process. If the current bills are drafted without proper consultation, there is room to accommodate diverse voices while they are discussed in the House committees. It won’t be possible to take discussions over all the bills to the public. However, some bills that are closely tied to public concerns need to be discussed at the provincial level or even at the local level, if possible. I also have realised the necessity of broader consultation and commit to it in the days to come.Let’s come to an amendment bill on the Transitional Justice Act. What is stopping the bill from being finalised?The Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the parliament has resolved most contentious issues after long discussions. We are close to finding meeting points on some disputed issues. We continue to engage in formal and informal discussions among the parties, with a plan to endorse it from the upcoming session. The Congress, when in government, didn’t have any differences over the bill. Rather our party had some concerns, which we are trying to sort out.I don’t think it suits the Congress to change its position after being sent to the opposition. People are closely following the position of the different parties on the bill.Listing murder as a serious violation and reduced sentencing are visibly the most contentious issues on the bill. What is the meeting point on these issues?Our party’s [the UML’s] position is clear. All killings of the disarmed people other than in the clashes are serious violations of human rights. All the parties have a common view over reduced sentencing but there are differences over its modality.We must be mindful that our transitional justice process delivers justice to the victims. The process cannot move ahead amid reservations from the victims. It is meaningless to push ahead with a process that is not acceptable to concerned stakeholders including the international community.The discussions among the parties are largely focused on these issues. From next week, the House committee will resume deliberations.A committee to recommend the names of the office bearers in two transitional justice commissions has been formed amid reservations from different quarters. Will it still recommend the names or wait until the bill is endorsed?Let us not forget that the committee was formed in line with a time-bound Supreme Court verdict. How can we ignore the court’s order? A bill doesn’t get endorsed in the government’s interest. It is a prerogative of the sovereign parliament. Demanding a halt to the formation of the recommendation committee when the court has already given its verdict is not a responsible act.I have come to know that the National Human Rights Commission hasn’t sent its representative to the committee, which is wrong. Being a responsible constitutional body it can’t baulk at implementing the court's order. It should send its representative. If there are concerns, s/he can present them before the committee.The committee has inducted two retired judges as its members which was the demands of the victims and the other stakeholders. Similarly, there has been an agreement that two members of the five-member commissions will be retired judges. We have tried to abide by the victims’ concerns as much as we can. When will the Supreme Court get justices in vacant positions?Three positions are already vacant and the fourth will be vacant in a matter of a month or so. Justices for all four positions will be selected in a week or two.Voices are growing mainly from the Congress to amend the constitution to revisit the electoral system.

We need to discuss how.Is there any possibility of the UML and Congress coming together to form a government?This is now a closed chapter.

What is the latest update?We’ve experienced an unprecedented number of fire incidents across Nepal. Around two months ago, we had made projections that something like this could happen. We hosted a national dialogue on disaster with experts from the department of hydrology and meteorology, scientists, foresters and representatives from forest users groups. The experts said this year’s outlook doesn’t look good from the perspectives of fire incidents, mainly because we didn’t get sufficient rainfall this winter. We received only one fifth or 20 percent of average. So, we had sensed the alarming situation. Along with that, we also witnessed soaring temperatures. Average temperatures have risen in hill areas as well. At the emergency meeting on Friday, we briefed top authorities about the likely scenarios due to soaring temperatures and low rainfall. This time, we also witnessed heavy winds that helped spread the fire.Are there other factors too that have made fires this year so disastrous?Inadequate rainfall, increased temperatures and wind gusts are immediate factors. There are two other factors: No fire incidents of this intensity in the past two years and only 1,528 incidents in 2022 and 3,194 in 2023. In 2021, at least 6,537 fire incidents took place, whereas there were only 1,211 incidents in 2020. When you have below average forest fire incidents in the preceding years, there is an accumulation of forest litter. While the litter piled up on the forest floor this time, there was not enough rainfall to dampen it. Rising temperatures and wind gusts added fuel, helping fires spread faster. Thus, the wildfires became more disastrous this time. Nine people have already lost their lives since Nepali New Year (April 13). The death toll of the two weeks is concerning. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane convened an emergency meeting on Friday where secretaries of the ministries concerned and security chiefs, among other senior officials, joined the discussions. We presented this scenario there and drew their attention to the fact that we still have another two months of dry season until the pre-monsoon rainfall. The next two months are going to be challenging. Besides that, there is an increasing trend of stubble burning mainly because youths aren’t available in villages to work in the fields. Due to acute shortage of labour and high cost of clearing fields, people are resorting to burning stubbles, weeds and other remains. There is a perception among the farmers that the ashes work as manure. So, we need massive awareness and training to tackle the situation. People need to be educated about the wider effects of such acts in society. We have also seen unprecedented levels of damage to houses and settlements. When large swathes of forests are burnt, a long-developed ecosystem is destroyed. There are also indirect impacts on human health. In 2019, an estimated 42,100 deaths were attributed to air pollution in Nepal. Besides, the movement of bad quality air from our southern neighbour India is also causing problems. So, this is also a regional problem. You said the ministry convened several meetings in and outside Kathmandu, held discussions among stakeholders and authorities concerned were also alerted. But why have our agencies failed to stop and contain fire incidents?Yes, we have convened a series of dialogues on fire incidents. We also organised events for specific municipalities. The most recent one was in Madhesh Province, where chief district officers of all eight districts in the province, among other officials, were invited. Home minister chaired the meeting. We are taking such initiatives to expedite preparatory measures.In fact, our forest coverage increased drastically in the past three decades. Globally, Nepal is taken as a success story in growing forests. This is positive but it also increases the risk of fires. We don’t have adequate human resources, training and equipment to protect these forests from fire. Also, the increasing trend of youths leaving the country and people migrating from the villages has exacerbated the situation. Women and the elderly who are left behind are more vulnerable to fire incidents. Homesteads of deserted houses are covered by bushes. We also find totally empty settlements. There is no gap between forests and settlements. These factors are causing disastrous fires.What is the government doing to tackle the problem in view of this changed context?We have introduced some new technologies based on our ground reality. Usually, we find people in our context go to the fire incident sites without any equipment and gear. There is also a lack of trained people across the country. So, we are focusing on training members of community forest groups. We now prioritise certain areas identified as hotspots. We are giving three types of training. We are training local volunteers who are working with palikas [local units] and other agencies at the local levels. We give orientation on how to put out fires in grasslands and bushes and how to do it when it spreads as crown fire. When trees start to burn people shouldn’t go there. Only fire brigades are useful in such cases. But fire trucks can’t go to difficult terrains. So, we have introduced portable fire pumps. We learned this from Japan’s national disaster management authority. These pumps are handheld. People can carry them on their own and use them in difficult terrains as well.Can they effectively put out big fires?They are quite effective. For that, you need a pond, a well or other source of water. Since last year, we have already used these water pumps in over 120 places and found them quite effective in dousing fires. At Friday’s meeting we decided to invest more in such pumps. I suggested every ward of local units need to have at least one such portable fire pump. They can’t replace fire trucks but are quite useful for us given our geographical features and even for narrow streets of a city like Kathmandu. You need Rs10 million to buy a fire truck, whereas around 20 portable pumps can be bought for the same amount. The cost ranges from Rs300,000 to around Rs1 million. So each ward can easily afford it. They can pump water from a distant pond or river in hill areas and it can be carried along with water tanks in narrow streets in towns. Maintaining a fire truck and fire brigade is difficult as we need drivers, firemen and their assistants. So, palikas may not be able to afford that. Therefore, we are planning to promote portable fire pumps.In addition, we are designing a training curriculum mainly targeting three sections of people—volunteers of community forest users groups, security agencies including the forest guards and the disaster responders and district level officials who should understand its nuances. We are also running campaigns through various types of awareness materials. In the meantime, we have added search and rescue equipment mainly for security agencies and other personnel deployed in the tasks. Likewise, we have started adopting advanced systems such as helicopters to put out forest fires. First time, we doused forest fires from helicopters through the ‘bambi bucket operations’ in Pathibhara of Taplejung and then in Shivapuri and Tanahu as well.Are palikas and other local agencies effective in tackling these cases?We have found local community forest groups quite active in tackling fire incidents. They may not be able to handle big fires. So they coordinate and work with security agencies. Our legal system has given palikas the lead in such cases. So, our role is to equip the local governments. We handed over 100 portable fire pumps to them while around 14 have been sent to district emergency operation centres. Our focus is on equipping local governments. Of them, some do really well. Some others have average performance while yet others do really poorly. We need to form a group of volunteers in each local unit, train them and equip them with gears. What about the role of provinces? Are they working effectively in disaster management?Provinces are critical especially for undertaking risk assessments and determining which palikas have higher, moderate and lower levels of risks. They can help enhance the capacity of local governments and in reconstruction as well. Some provincial authorities are working as per that spirit, such as in Koshi and Bagmati. Karnali has introduced a new concept of insurance for humans as well as property loss.In recent years, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of big business complexes in Kathmandu and other cities. But they don’t seem prepared to tackle fire incidents or other disasters. How do you see this trend?This is a serious issue. We discussed this matter in Friday’s emergency meeting as well. We need to devise a system to assess risk in such buildings. These buildings need to be inspected and checked for whether there is a fire fighting system in place, adequate exits and evacuation systems. We will work on these issues with local governments as it falls under their jurisdiction.

Japan desperately needs foreign workers due to the shortage of a domestic labour force. Therefore, it is in the interest of both countries to make sure that Nepali people who passed the examination for SSW can find a job smoothly and travel to Japan without excessive financial burden. However, in a recent article, there seem to be some crucial misunderstandings and confusions about the Memorandum of Cooperation Japan and Nepal concluded in 2019, which we fear may complicate the smooth implementation of our agreement (‘Third party involvement in Japan job programme contradicts agreement’, December 21, 2020). The embassy would like to clarify the following.The article mentions, ‘The agreement says that recruitment is to be carried out under a government-to-government (G2G) modality’. This is not true. The Memorandum does not provide any government-to-government procedure for sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal. The contract of employment will be signed by the Nepali workers and their employers in Japan. The Government of Japan doesn’t interfere in the private labour market. On the other hand, the Government of Nepal wants to put the implementation of the employment process under its control by issuing permission to Nepali workers wishing to work in Japan. It rather should be called ‘government-to-business modality (G2B)’. Maybe this misunderstanding derives from the fact that Nepal has concluded migrant worker agreements with other countries only under the G2G modality and has not used the G2B modality.Since last October, 207 Nepalis passed the Japanese language test for care workers and 234 Nepalis passed the technical test for care workers. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to find a job so far. It is desirable they make their own effort to find a job in the Japanese labour market. The article further mentions, ‘both countries had strictly ruled out the role of any third party agencies while hiring and supplying workers to Japan’. This is also untrue. The MOC does not have any paragraph stating to exclude the operation of private recruiting agencies. Paragraph 4 of the Memorandum states that Japan and Nepal can consult on issues related to corrective measures for improper accepting organisations in Japan, or organisations engaging in support for foreign human resources with the status of residence of specified skilled workers, and for the improper activities of the concerned organisations in Nepal. Therefore, the participation of private organisations in the process of sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal is not prohibited. The intermediary agencies to provide Nepali workers with jobs should be registered in Japan in accordance with Japanese laws.The article referred to the possibility that Nepali workers who wish to work in Japan may have to pay for airfare, insurance and medical examination. Since Japan is a free economy country, the Government of Japan can’t enforce Japanese companies to pay these costs for Nepali workers. In practice, most Japanese companies cover these costs in employment contracts, but it depends on the individual contract.The article further stated that ‘Nepal is the only South Asian country from where Japan would be hiring workers for 14 industrial sectors’. Actually, Japan also signed similar agreements with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after Nepal.We hope that this information is helpful for Nepali people to better understand the agreement between the two countries and that those who passed the examination will be able to find a job and go to Japan as soon as possible.The Embassy of Japan in Nepal ","summary":"We understand that many Nepalis look for an opportunity to work in Japan, and their expectations are very high, as Japan opened up its labour market for Nepalis as specified skilled workers (SSW) and a direct flight between Nepal and Japan was opened in 2019.

Actually, Japan also signed similar agreements with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after Nepal.We hope that this information is helpful for Nepali people to better understand the agreement between the two countries and that those who passed the examination will be able to find a job and go to Japan as soon as possible.The Embassy of Japan in Nepal "},{"hash":"4d564e4aa9b147540d5d27c861b9724bce96976aa16a590835a10f4f29687ad6","title":"contributions-to-nepali","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/letters/2020/11/30/contributions-to-nepali","date":1606694400000,"source":"kp","category":"letters","content":"I am very grateful to Deepak Thapa for raising concerns about the fate of Nepali studies in Euro-America, and for his kind words about my own work over the years (‘Nepali language at SOAS’, November 25).

Here, I’m not only addressing the horrendous issue of Chhaupadi itself but also speaking of those women and girls who fall prey to this absurd menstrual practice.Ever thought what travelling back in time would feel like? Many in Nepal do not have to imagine, as such old and evil practises continue to occur in the 21st century!Chhaupadi is a flawed tradition connected to the taboo surrounding menstruation that prohibits Hindu menstruators from participating in normal family activities while on their period, as they are considered impure. Although it is said to be practised in the rural part of the country, it does exist in urban areas, too. Going back to its roots, we could perhaps rationalise that women were asked to stay cautious when menstruating because humans were closely surrounded by wildlife. The stench of blood during their period may have made them more vulnerable to attacks from these animals. But even this absurd line of thought doesn't make much sense anymore. The practise was made illegal in 2005, but cases related to it were reported as recent as 2019. News headlines vouched for fatalities on this account. But why are there such trivial punishments for such an offence? Shouldn’t the punishments be rethought to strongly discourage Chhaupadi altogether?Moreover, the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The more you look into it, there are bound to be cases that have gone unreported because nothing immediately tragic occurred. This letter is a call for all of us to come together to fight this social plague. While the legal implications of such an offence are ambiguous, let's collectively decide that the societal implications of it will be grave. Let's refuse to accept such atrocities for our mothers, sisters and, above all, ourselves.Gauri Tandon, via email ","summary":"While feminine issues are addressed every now and then, not everything is taken seriously, and the unspoken issues go unnoticed.
