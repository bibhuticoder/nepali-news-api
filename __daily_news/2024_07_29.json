We\nhave been scaling up the Safe Delivery App and the accompanying programme\nacross the world, and I’m beyond happy that we’ll now also be supporting midwives\nand other healthcare professionals in Nepal in ensuring safer births for women and\nbabies,” says Anna Frellsen, CEO of Maternity Foundation.  \nThe Nepali version of the App, which contains thirteen modules, has been developed\nin collaboration with UNFPA and Family Welfare Division, Department of Health\nServices, Ministry of Health and Population and other partners.\nIn addition to the new Nepali version, the digital tool is also available in five global\nversions based on WHO guidelines (English, French, Arabic, Spanish and\nPortuguese) and more than 30 language versions, adapted to national contexts and\nneeds.\n\n\n\n"},{"hash":"28dc77d62f2300909fe67768264be6b86f69ed0eb1759b112b7a0e6b0368841e","title":"new-record-created-by-pasang-namgel-sherpa","date":1722038400000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/travel-and-tourism/new-record-created-by-pasang-namgel-sherpa","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/pasang_namgel1722074459_1024.jpg","category":"travel-and-tourism","content":"\n Senior climbing guide,  Pasang Namgel Sherpa, has successfully summited Broad Peak this morning, July 27, 2024.  Imagine Nepal trekking Company  confirms Pasang's conquering of all 14 of the world's highest peaks.

Among the affected families, hundreds have been displaced from their homes. Owing to the government’s apathy, those who have been taking refuge in schools, community homes and in barns of the neighbours and relatives have been deprived of immediate relief money to build temporary shelters.“We don’t have the budget even to provide an immediate relief amount to those displaced in various disasters,” said Anil Pokhrel, chief executive officer of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA). “Hundreds of families are still waiting for relief money so that they can build makeshift shelters.”Living in schools, community homes and cattle sheds for a long time is not easy. School administrations often ask the displaced people to vacate, as their presence disrupts regular classes. Officials concede that displaced people make daily rounds of the local authorities and homes of elected representatives, hoping to get the first tranche of relief amounts, but they return disappointed.“We have asked for Rs250 million to provide immediate relief to the displaced, so that they can start building temporary shelters, but the Ministry of Finance has released only Rs30 million. This is insufficient to meet the needs of hundreds of victims,” said an official at the authority, asking not to be named, as he is not authorised to speak to the media. Officials admit that the authority is unable to release relief money not only for those displaced during the ongoing monsoon, but also for the victims of the rain-related disasters from 2020.They say the number of disaster victims, who have been waiting for relief amounts, is in the thousands.“There are over 1,700 displaced families in our district,” said Rabiraj Dhital, Information officer at District Administration Office, Sindhupalchok. “Of the total number of displaced, around 1,000 have received the first tranche to begin building houses, and 400 have received the second tranche. The reality is that most victims’ homes remain unfinished due to the authorities’ failure to offer timely relief, leaving them in pitiable conditions.”The government has decided to provide Rs550,000 to the disaster victims. Of this amount, 15 percent will come from the respective local units, 30 percent from the provincial government, and 55 percent from the federal government.“Had the federal and provincial government agencies told us that they would not provide anything, we would have made a decision on the relief amount ourselves,” said Aitaman Tamang, chairman of Melamchi Municipality. “Every day, displaced people come to my office and even to my home asking for relief, but I can’t make any decisions.”Officials at the NDRRMA said that the delay by the Cabinet in approving recent changes in relief-related guidelines is the main reason displaced people haven’t received relief money. “Those displaced by the Jajarkot earthquakes got Rs50,000 in immediate relief to start building temporary shelters,” said chief executive officer Pokhrel. “The guidelines’s approval would allow similar support for families affected by other disasters, particularly floods, fire, and landslides.”Pokhrel said that the guidelines have now been submitted for the Cabinet’s approval, and once approved, the authority will be able to provide similar support to families affected by floods and landslides.Nepal is highly vulnerable to natural disasters like earthquakes, landslides and floods. The country, however, struggles to effectively manage large-scale disasters, experts say. They say the reactive approach of the authorities concerned is responsible for the loss of lives and property.The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has forecast above-normal rains and above-average temperatures the monsoon, which could unleash extreme weather events such as flooding, inundation, and landslides.Several districts have already experienced incidents of landslides, floods and lightning since the monsoon season began.According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, at least 1,140 people have died, while 120 others are missing due to landslides, floods, and lightning since June 10.Officials at the authority said 86 people—41 males and 40 females—have been killed in landslides, 26 in floods—11 males and 15 females—and 23 more in lightning strikes. Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees.Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.The NDRRMA estimates that 1.81 million people and 412,000 households will be affected by monsoon this year. Of them, 83,000 households will be directly hit, and 18,000 families will require rescue from monsoon-related disasters.

Officials admit that the authority is unable to release relief money not only for those displaced during the ongoing monsoon, but also for the victims of the rain-related disasters from 2020.They say the number of disaster victims, who have been waiting for relief amounts, is in the thousands.“There are over 1,700 displaced families in our district,” said Rabiraj Dhital, Information officer at District Administration Office, Sindhupalchok. “Of the total number of displaced, around 1,000 have received the first tranche to begin building houses, and 400 have received the second tranche. The reality is that most victims’ homes remain unfinished due to the authorities’ failure to offer timely relief, leaving them in pitiable conditions.”The government has decided to provide Rs550,000 to the disaster victims. Of this amount, 15 percent will come from the respective local units, 30 percent from the provincial government, and 55 percent from the federal government.“Had the federal and provincial government agencies told us that they would not provide anything, we would have made a decision on the relief amount ourselves,” said Aitaman Tamang, chairman of Melamchi Municipality. “Every day, displaced people come to my office and even to my home asking for relief, but I can’t make any decisions.”Officials at the NDRRMA said that the delay by the Cabinet in approving recent changes in relief-related guidelines is the main reason displaced people haven’t received relief money. “Those displaced by the Jajarkot earthquakes got Rs50,000 in immediate relief to start building temporary shelters,” said chief executive officer Pokhrel. “The guidelines’s approval would allow similar support for families affected by other disasters, particularly floods, fire, and landslides.”Pokhrel said that the guidelines have now been submitted for the Cabinet’s approval, and once approved, the authority will be able to provide similar support to families affected by floods and landslides.Nepal is highly vulnerable to natural disasters like earthquakes, landslides and floods. The country, however, struggles to effectively manage large-scale disasters, experts say. They say the reactive approach of the authorities concerned is responsible for the loss of lives and property.The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has forecast above-normal rains and above-average temperatures the monsoon, which could unleash extreme weather events such as flooding, inundation, and landslides.Several districts have already experienced incidents of landslides, floods and lightning since the monsoon season began.According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, at least 1,140 people have died, while 120 others are missing due to landslides, floods, and lightning since June 10.Officials at the authority said 86 people—41 males and 40 females—have been killed in landslides, 26 in floods—11 males and 15 females—and 23 more in lightning strikes. Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees.Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.The NDRRMA estimates that 1.81 million people and 412,000 households will be affected by monsoon this year. Of them, 83,000 households will be directly hit, and 18,000 families will require rescue from monsoon-related disasters.

Therefore, Annex 13 investigations do not concern themselves with apportioning blame or liability.Any judicial or administrative proceedings to apportion blame or liability will be separate. In Nepal, there is no single example of a judicial or criminal proceeding in 108 air incidents spanning the country’s 71-year-old aviation history.

Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. ","summary":"Within days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image.

Among the four state elements—sovereignty, territory, population and government—Nepal fares well in three but governance. Its strength lies in its capacity to endure overbearing upheavals that occasionally occur. Since the Anglo-Nepal War (1814-15), which led to the signing of the Sugauli Treaty, Nepal has not compromised its territory. This has been possible through timely, realistic foreign policy within the parameters of bilateral treaties with India and China. Such trends continue even today, despite the extension and diversification of policies. Popular movements have overthrown regimes ranging from Rana autocracy to monarchy; power has transferred smoothly from traditional monarchy to republic. The Nepali state thus remains unruffled by the general belief that monarchy and Nepal’s existence were coterminous or that one could not survive without the other. The Nepal Army, considered the mainstay of power and had served the Ranas and the Shahs, changed its status by supporting the new democratic republic. The Nepali state did not realise any threat to its existence during the 10-year-long Maoist insurgency or later in the wake of instabilities triggered by political parties. But it must be admitted that political parties have acted in unison while facing major political crises or defending the cause of democracy. They steadfastly proclaimed the republican constitution in 2015, resisting outside pressure to defer its announcement to make it more inclusive by addressing the demands of Madhesh parties. Nevertheless, a common feeling is that major political parties have failed to deliver on the minimum aspirations of the public as they are excessively indulged in petty personal and party interests. As a result, the governance crisis, fraught with dangers to other state elements, persists. Since sovereignty and fixed territory are the major elements, the Nepali state has a solid border stretching from the Mechi River in the east to the Mahakali River in the west, Tibet (China) to the north and India to the south (on three sides). Nepal has maintained a fixed boundary with its neighbours for over 200 years. It is highly unlikely that the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity will be jeopardised in the future because of geopolitical limitations that prevent us from being cavalier in handling foreign policy. Moreover, strategic autonomy, often used as a cliché in international relations, is a relative term employed only when allowed to do so in the given political context. All powers, big or small, strong or weak, have limitations and cannot always independently act as they want. The United States, China, Russia, or any other power cannot impose their respective decisions in the face of counter-actions to be undertaken by other hostile powers. For instance, the Russian invasion of Ukraine or China’s restraint on taking strong action against Taiwan, despite displaying aggressive postures, are some examples of limited autonomy of powers. Russia is badly entangled in its invasion of Ukraine, as the Western powers and a few others have not only condemned the Russian aggression but also taken countermeasures to foil its mission. The sovereignty of the state can be preserved only by relying more on prudent domestic and foreign policy, not on arming the state to the teeth. It is particularly so in Nepal’s context, whose very location does not allow it to be indifferent to the sensitivities of its neighbours, China and India. Such limitations have helped maintain Nepal’s long civilisational tradition and history of an independent sovereign nation-state. Fixed territory, recognition of independence and sovereignty buttressed by sound external policy are the country’s strengths. Recurring issues of minor territorial disputes with neighbours do not amount to the loss of settled international borders. Interestingly, in Jhapa, there are two places, Satighatta and Kechana Kawal, where Nepal’s border extends across the Mechi River, creating enclaves like those found in other countries. Surprisingly, no territorial disputes concerning these enclaves have arisen between Nepal and India, but the grudges of local Nepali citizens for being ignored by the state haunt the rulers. People who constitute an element of the state can be described according to the nature of the regime. In traditional monarchical regimes, as were prevalent in many countries of the world, people were/are treated as raiti or praja (subject), having no freedom of expression against the rulers. In such regimes, subject political culture prevails, thus forcing the people to be indoctrinated accordingly. Contrarily, in a democracy, people participate in the political process, which makes the government responsible for them. Popular legitimacy is, therefore, the essence of democratic governance. When such legitimate rights are denied, people revolt against the regimes, as happened in Nepal in 1990 and 2006. Legitimacy has different dimensions that transcend economic, political, social and international. It can be broadly called performance legitimacy, which is concerned with governability. If the system fails to cater to the minimum needs of the general public or fails to reduce socio-economic disparities, then the system begins to face mounting challenges that sometimes turn into rebellion. So, governance and legitimacy are inextricably linked. Today, liberal democracies or authoritarian regimes with limited pluralism seem to confront the crises of performance legitimacy and are increasingly becoming vulnerable to uncertain developments. Nepal’s social structure is solid, as the people live in peace and harmony amid socio-political degradation and despair. Social scientists prefer to call such a matrix as syncretic and synthetic. Religious bigotries are little known to Nepalis. Nevertheless, since the primacy of politics is well accepted, political parties have invariably failed to set an example by demonstrating their governability. Yet, Nepal’s exercises are not as alarming as many pundits tend to present. The country has been able to manage crises that creep into the body politic. The elected leaders are expected to be more sensible in consolidating the gains of the new democratic order.

But there’s another, equally important part of this microbial community that remains far less known: the virome.The virome consists of all the viruses that inhabit our bodies. This includes those that infect humans cells, bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) and the viruses we aquire from our diet and environment. Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth, with an estimated 10³¹ viral particles globally and about 10¹³ in each human being. For centuries, viruses have been seen mainly as causes of disease. But research suggests that viruses influence our health in important ways.Bacteriophages, for instance, play a crucial role in regulating the bacterial populations in our gut. By keeping harmful bacteria in check, they help prevent conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and obesity.Certain bacteriophages can also enhance the immune system’s ability to combat bacterial infections. They do this by breaking down the outer membranes of harmful bacteria—releasing antigens that stimulate immune responses.Some viruses that interact directly with our immune system even help maintain its balance—potentially protecting us from illnesses. For instance, herpesvirus, which causes cold sores and mononucleosis (mono), can alter immune responses. It does this in many ways—such as by promoting the production of specialised immune cells, altering the gene expression of cells and even suppressing anti-inflammatory responses. These changes may potentially reduce risk of developing secondary infections and allergic responses later in life.Conversely, some viruses might contribute to chronic inflammation by persistently activating immune pathways. The balance of these interactions is critical. A healthy virome helps fend off infections and support overall health.

Bioinformatics tools and databases, such as ViromeQC and the Gut Virome Database, may further support the identification and classification of viral sequences—making it easier to explore these complex communities.These innovations also mean researchers better understand the complexity of the virome and its role in human health.For example, research published earlier this year which tracked infants and their mothers found significant differences in their viromes. This indicates that an infant’s virome is shaped by factors such as diet and environment, rather than being inherited from the mother.Another study showed that newborns typically have no detectable virome at birth, but quickly acquire a diverse array of viruses, mainly bacteriophages, shortly after birth. These viruses are probably picked up from their environment, diet and the people they’re in close contact with.Alterations in the virome have been linked to various diseases, as well. For instance, changes in gut viral populations have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Patients with IBD often have higher levels of certain bacteriophages, suggesting these viruses may play a role in the disease’s development.Understanding the virome could revolutionise medicine and public health. One exciting possibility is phage therapy, where bacteriophages are used to target and destroy harmful bacteria. This approach could offer a powerful tool against antibiotic-resistant infections. Identifying specific virome changes could also lead to new diagnostic markers for diseases—possibly enabling earlier and more accurate interventions.The virome’s interaction with the immune system could hold promise for new vaccines and immune therapies, as well.

But there’s another, equally important part of this microbial community that remains far less known: the virome.The virome consists of all the viruses that inhabit our bodies. This includes those that infect humans cells, bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) and the viruses we aquire from our diet and environment. Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth, with an estimated 10³¹ viral particles globally and about 10¹³ in each human being. For centuries, viruses have been seen mainly as causes of disease. But research suggests that viruses influence our health in important ways.Bacteriophages, for instance, play a crucial role in regulating the bacterial populations in our gut. By keeping harmful bacteria in check, they help prevent conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and obesity.Certain bacteriophages can also enhance the immune system’s ability to combat bacterial infections. They do this by breaking down the outer membranes of harmful bacteria—releasing antigens that stimulate immune responses.Some viruses that interact directly with our immune system even help maintain its balance—potentially protecting us from illnesses. For instance, herpesvirus, which causes cold sores and mononucleosis (mono), can alter immune responses.

This is because the industry is beset by deep-rooted corruption and mismanagement as the country builds airports worth billions of rupees but fails to attract flights. Improving safety remains a far cry.On different occasions, global aviation watchdogs have voiced serious concerns about the capability of Nepal’s civil aviation authority to oversee safety issues.In the past year and a half, more than 100 people have lost their lives in plane crashes—despite air travel being the world’s safest and most regulated industry in the world. Wednesday’s crash is the seventh under Pradip Adhikari, the director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal who fits into all political systems, and the fourth fatal one of his tenure.Here are a few examples of how policy corruption has paralysed the Nepali aviation industry, the lifeline of the country’s tourism industry and transport in the mountain region. A few years back, a parliamentary sub-committee headed by Madhav Kumar Nepal had ordered the government to immediately split the civil aviation body due to its dual role of doing business and regulating the sector. Nepal, the CPN (Unified Socialist) leader, sent Prem Ale to head the tourism ministry a few months later. Ale stopped the bills from being tabled in the lower house for discussion, although the upper house had passed them.Then, Jeevan Ram Shrestha was appointed tourism minister. On his first day, he announced that he would wait to meet the European Commission’s request to separate Nepal’s civil aviation into regulatory and service-providing organisations.After that, Sudan Kirati was picked as the tourism minister by the Maoist Centre. He took the initiative to register the civil aviation bills in Parliament.Kirati had accused Director General Adhikari of consistently failing to ensure aviation safety, as five aircraft incidents and accidents, including three major disasters, have occurred under Adhikari’s watch.Sources said then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal summoned Kirati and Adhikari and ordered them to work “in tandem”. Kirati then stopped talking about the separation.The issue was then taken up by the parliamentary International Relations and Tourism Committee, which directed Dahal, then prime minister, to table the civil aviation bills in the House of Representatives as soon as possible. The directive was issued in December last year. “The bills have been languishing for a long time. As we doubt the civil aviation ministry will table them in Parliament, we have directed the Prime Minister's Office to do so,” Raj Kishore Yadav, chairman of the committee, had told the Post. A few months later, when the Post approached Yadav to inquire about any progress on the bills, Yadav replied that a split “was not necessary”. The budget for this fiscal year, too, makes no mention of the plan to split the aviation body, after including it in the federal government’s document for three consecutive years.In April, lawmaker and member of the International Relations and Tourism Committee Udaya Shumsher Rana told an interaction that he was informed by a former tourism minister that there is an “invisible” hand preventing the passage of two crucial civil aviation bills. In August 2022, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the United Nations aviation watchdog, formally asked Nepal to split the civil aviation body and ensure a proper regulatory system. However, the Civil Aviation Authority chose to keep the report secret.A former director general said the tourism industry is bearing the repercussions as planes come down each passing year due to a lax regulatory system. “People are dying due to ‘policy corruption.’”On a sunny Wednesday, nineteen people, including two crew members, were on the Saurya Airlines flight to Pokhara. The 50-seater bombardier CRJ 200 with registration mark 9N-AME was flying 15 technicians to the city, where the jet’s heavy maintenance C-check was planned. At 11:11 am, the plane took off from the runway’s southern end (Koteshwar). But just a few seconds after the takeoff, people around the airport heard a loud “bang”. “That was an unusual sound. It was a big bang like a bomb [exploding],” said a top official of a private airline, who was a close witness to the crash.Video footage obtained by the Post shows that the jet rolled and climbed around 80-90ft from the ground. It then tilted towards the right and instantly came down. It hit the ground and burst into flames.The plane then rolled down into a ravine.The cockpit slammed into a cargo container, and it was stuck there, which observers say saved the pilot-in-command, Manish Ratna Shakya, the chief of the operation department at Saurya Airlines.“The pilot survived. He is in stable condition,” said DIG Dan Bahadur Karki, spokesperson for Nepal Police. “It was a miracle.”The fuselage came apart, hit the slope of the tabletop airport, and ricocheted 50 metres away, finally coming to rest on the muddy ground.Eighteen people, including the co-pilot and a foreigner, died. The cockpit and tail were intact.The 21.4-year-old aircraft was inducted into the Saurya Airlines fleet on March 14, 2017.CCTV footage shows that the nature of the crash was similar to last January’s Yeti Airlines crash in Pokhara.Experts suspect many factors, including an engine failure, a bird strike, and poor maintenance.“The investigation will tell the truth,” said Subash Jha, spokesman for Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport. This is the second biggest crash inside the Kathmandu airport after the US Bangla, a Dhaka-based airline, accident in March 2018 killed 52 of the 71 passengers aboard. Experts observing the crash closely say that, given the nature of the plane’s fall, the right engine might have stopped working and the aircraft eventually lost the “control panel” mode. This narrow panel, located centrally in front of the pilot, can be used to control heading, speed, altitude, vertical speed, vertical navigation, and lateral navigation.“The aircraft has banked,” said an aircraft engineer. A banked turn (or banking turn) is a turn or change of direction in which the aircraft banks or inclines, usually towards the inside of the turn.“Had it been the left engine, it could have potentially crashed into at least two big planes parked at the tarmac of the airport and the domestic terminal. The impact was huge. The plane just exploded.”One official at the safety department of the civil aviation body suspected a potential bird strike. “What happens when a bird enters an aircraft engine? If an aircraft engine ingests a bird, it can result in engine failure.”“In such a case, if the pilot failed to judge and identify which of the two engines is the problematic one, it could lead to such a situation.”But a senior airline executive countered the argument.“The aircraft has two engines. Even if one engine fails, it would be difficult to climb, but only if it has a full load. The 50-seater plane was carrying just 17 people, a third of its capacity. I don’t believe a bird strike downed the plane.”He, however, suspects poor maintenance. On Wednesday, the plane had taken off after 30 days on the ground.In many cases, a plane stored for several weeks or months could encounter problems if it is flown without a proper inspection. Saurya does not have a hangar in Kathmandu.A civil aviation body official confirmed that the 9N-AME had been on the ground for 30 days.“The engine exploded. Given the nature of the explosion, foreign object damage (FOD) to an aircraft engine can be suspected. FOD happens when a foreign object impacts the engine. Since there are no proper hangers for the storage of its planes in Kathmandu, FOD cannot be ruled out,” said the expert, dismissing the bird strike theory.A senior air safety specialist, who wished not to be named because the investigation is ongoing, said both events—a bird strike and FOD—cannot be ruled out.“Only the flying captain, the lone survivor, and the black box can tell us what exactly happened,” said the air safety specialist. “However, to stop unnecessary rumours, the investigation team should record the captain’s statement and release a preliminary report immediately.”Aviation analyst Hemant Arjyal wrote on the social media platform X: “We do not know what actually happened in today’s crash, but engine seems to be the culprit. And technically, IF a multi-engine aircraft suffers an engine failure during the takeoff roll, THE AIRCRAFT WILL YAW TOWARDS THE FAILED ENGINE.”The airline company has been in a financial crisis for several years. Its financial health deteriorated especially after the Covid pandemic.Last year, it submitted a plan to the civil aviation body to switch to ATR-72-type aircraft and promised to maintain safety standards of the existing fleet until it imported the ATR planes. However, airline officials say they could not secure investment to replace their fleet.However, the civil aviation body overlooked the airline’s financial condition, which is obviously a major safety concern.“With Nepal’s key festival just over two months away, Saurya, which had a total of three aircraft, was planning a full maintenance of the Bombardier that crashed on Wednesday to remain afloat. The Bombardier CRJ200 had 200 engine hours left for full maintenance,” according to insiders. Full maintenance alone does not necessarily ensure full safety of flights.Now the airline is left with just one airworthy plane, and authorities are unlikely to allow the company to operate for the same reason. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli paid a rare visit to the crash site on Wednesday.Saurya Airlines had also laid off staff due to financial problems last year. Despite several attempts, the airline officials could not be reached for comments.According to insiders, poor aircraft maintenance could be one of the potential crash factors, as keeping planes airworthy is costly.Engineers who wrote “fit to fly” too died in the crash.Yet in the immediate aftermath of the crash, there is also a lot of confusion.Another aviation expert ruled out the possibility of poor maintenance. “The entire maintenance team was on the plane. Why would they be on a suicide mission if the plane was ill-maintained?”However, the crash has shed light on different aspects of regulatory failure.It was later found that among the entire maintenance team, two passengers [one child and a woman], the son and wife of a Saurya technician, were flown in the plane cleared for maintenance, which is against the rule.“This suggests the regulator’s negligence,” said Sanjiv Gautam, former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. “How can the regulator allow passengers on the ferry flight? That’s sheer negligence.”A ferry flight involves flying an aircraft from one location to another without passengers or cargo, typically for maintenance purposes.Aviation in Nepal is beset with deep-set corruption and mismanagement.The frequent crashes have deterred foreign tourists. Especially high-end tourists have been avoiding travel outside Kathmandu by air because they worry about safety, according to tour operators.Global aviation watchdogs have questioned the civil aviation body’s dual role and urged Nepal to split the organisation into two entities—service provider and regulator—to enhance the safety of flyers.However, successive governments have not shown much interest, although they have spent over Rs 500 million on drafting the civil aviation bills.Following the September 2012 crash of Sita Air Flight 601 in the Manohara river, which killed 19 people, including seven British citizens, the European Commission imposed a blanket ban on Nepali airlines from flying into the 27-nation bloc in December 2013.It’s been 11 years, and the ban has not been lifted as Nepal has failed to address safety deficiencies.According to Nepal’s civil aviation body, nearly 950 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955. And just in a year and a half, more than 100 people have perished in air crashes, indicating higher casualties as bigger aircraft are involved in recent accidents.In January 2023, a Yeti Airlines plane crashed in Pokhara, killing all 72 people on board, in the third biggest air accident in terms of casualties. The crash happened two weeks after the inauguration of the China-funded airport.The first big air accident in Nepal happened on September 28, 1992, when an Airbus A310 belonging to Pakistan International Airlines slammed into a hillside at Bhattedanda near the Kathmandu Valley, killing 167 people on board.Before that, on July 31, 1992, an Airbus A310 of Thai Airways crashed in Ghyangphedi, killing 113 on board.The government on Wednesday formed a five-member commission headed by Ratish Chandra Lal Suman, former director general of Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, to investigate the crash. ","summary":"There is a saying about Nepal’s aviation industry: Every new tourism minister is greeted by at least one crash. This is because the industry is beset by deep-rooted corruption and mismanagement as the country builds airports worth billions of rupees but fails to attract flights. Improving safety remains a far cry.On different occasions, global aviation watchdogs have voiced serious concerns about the capability of Nepal’s civil aviation authority to oversee safety issues.In the past year and a half, more than 100 people have lost their lives in plane crashes—despite air travel being the world’s safest and most regulated industry in the world. Wednesday’s crash is the seventh under Pradip Adhikari, the director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal who fits into all political systems, and the fourth fatal one of his tenure.Here are a few examples of how policy corruption has paralysed the Nepali aviation industry, the lifeline of the country’s tourism industry and transport in the mountain region. A few years back, a parliamentary sub-committee headed by Madhav Kumar Nepal had ordered the government to immediately split the civil aviation body due to its dual role of doing business and regulating the sector. Nepal, the CPN (Unified Socialist) leader, sent Prem Ale to head the tourism ministry a few months later. Ale stopped the bills from being tabled in the lower house for discussion, although the upper house had passed them.Then, Jeevan Ram Shrestha was appointed tourism minister. On his first day, he announced that he would wait to meet the European Commission’s request to separate Nepal’s civil aviation into regulatory and service-providing organisations.After that, Sudan Kirati was picked as the tourism minister by the Maoist Centre. He took the initiative to register the civil aviation bills in Parliament.Kirati had accused Director General Adhikari of consistently failing to ensure aviation safety, as five aircraft incidents and accidents, including three major disasters, have occurred under Adhikari’s watch.Sources said then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal summoned Kirati and Adhikari and ordered them to work “in tandem”. Kirati then stopped talking about the separation.The issue was then taken up by the parliamentary International Relations and Tourism Committee, which directed Dahal, then prime minister, to table the civil aviation bills in the House of Representatives as soon as possible. The directive was issued in December last year. “The bills have been languishing for a long time. As we doubt the civil aviation ministry will table them in Parliament, we have directed the Prime Minister's Office to do so,” Raj Kishore Yadav, chairman of the committee, had told the Post. A few months later, when the Post approached Yadav to inquire about any progress on the bills, Yadav replied that a split “was not necessary”. The budget for this fiscal year, too, makes no mention of the plan to split the aviation body, after including it in the federal government’s document for three consecutive years.In April, lawmaker and member of the International Relations and Tourism Committee Udaya Shumsher Rana told an interaction that he was informed by a former tourism minister that there is an “invisible” hand preventing the passage of two crucial civil aviation bills. In August 2022, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the United Nations aviation watchdog, formally asked Nepal to split the civil aviation body and ensure a proper regulatory system. However, the Civil Aviation Authority chose to keep the report secret.A former director general said the tourism industry is bearing the repercussions as planes come down each passing year due to a lax regulatory system. “People are dying due to ‘policy corruption.’”On a sunny Wednesday, nineteen people, including two crew members, were on the Saurya Airlines flight to Pokhara. The 50-seater bombardier CRJ 200 with registration mark 9N-AME was flying 15 technicians to the city, where the jet’s heavy maintenance C-check was planned. At 11:11 am, the plane took off from the runway’s southern end (Koteshwar). But just a few seconds after the takeoff, people around the airport heard a loud “bang”. “That was an unusual sound. It was a big bang like a bomb [exploding],” said a top official of a private airline, who was a close witness to the crash.Video footage obtained by the Post shows that the jet rolled and climbed around 80-90ft from the ground. It then tilted towards the right and instantly came down. It hit the ground and burst into flames.The plane then rolled down into a ravine.The cockpit slammed into a cargo container, and it was stuck there, which observers say saved the pilot-in-command, Manish Ratna Shakya, the chief of the operation department at Saurya Airlines.“The pilot survived. He is in stable condition,” said DIG Dan Bahadur Karki, spokesperson for Nepal Police. “It was a miracle.”The fuselage came apart, hit the slope of the tabletop airport, and ricocheted 50 metres away, finally coming to rest on the muddy ground.Eighteen people, including the co-pilot and a foreigner, died. The cockpit and tail were intact.The 21.4-year-old aircraft was inducted into the Saurya Airlines fleet on March 14, 2017.CCTV footage shows that the nature of the crash was similar to last January’s Yeti Airlines crash in Pokhara.Experts suspect many factors, including an engine failure, a bird strike, and poor maintenance.“The investigation will tell the truth,” said Subash Jha, spokesman for Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport. This is the second biggest crash inside the Kathmandu airport after the US Bangla, a Dhaka-based airline, accident in March 2018 killed 52 of the 71 passengers aboard. Experts observing the crash closely say that, given the nature of the plane’s fall, the right engine might have stopped working and the aircraft eventually lost the “control panel” mode. This narrow panel, located centrally in front of the pilot, can be used to control heading, speed, altitude, vertical speed, vertical navigation, and lateral navigation.“The aircraft has banked,” said an aircraft engineer. A banked turn (or banking turn) is a turn or change of direction in which the aircraft banks or inclines, usually towards the inside of the turn.“Had it been the left engine, it could have potentially crashed into at least two big planes parked at the tarmac of the airport and the domestic terminal. The impact was huge. The plane just exploded.”One official at the safety department of the civil aviation body suspected a potential bird strike. “What happens when a bird enters an aircraft engine? If an aircraft engine ingests a bird, it can result in engine failure.”“In such a case, if the pilot failed to judge and identify which of the two engines is the problematic one, it could lead to such a situation.”But a senior airline executive countered the argument.“The aircraft has two engines. Even if one engine fails, it would be difficult to climb, but only if it has a full load. The 50-seater plane was carrying just 17 people, a third of its capacity. I don’t believe a bird strike downed the plane.”He, however, suspects poor maintenance. On Wednesday, the plane had taken off after 30 days on the ground.In many cases, a plane stored for several weeks or months could encounter problems if it is flown without a proper inspection. Saurya does not have a hangar in Kathmandu.A civil aviation body official confirmed that the 9N-AME had been on the ground for 30 days.“The engine exploded. Given the nature of the explosion, foreign object damage (FOD) to an aircraft engine can be suspected. FOD happens when a foreign object impacts the engine. Since there are no proper hangers for the storage of its planes in Kathmandu, FOD cannot be ruled out,” said the expert, dismissing the bird strike theory.A senior air safety specialist, who wished not to be named because the investigation is ongoing, said both events—a bird strike and FOD—cannot be ruled out.“Only the flying captain, the lone survivor, and the black box can tell us what exactly happened,” said the air safety specialist. “However, to stop unnecessary rumours, the investigation team should record the captain’s statement and release a preliminary report immediately.”Aviation analyst Hemant Arjyal wrote on the social media platform X: “We do not know what actually happened in today’s crash, but engine seems to be the culprit. And technically, IF a multi-engine aircraft suffers an engine failure during the takeoff roll, THE AIRCRAFT WILL YAW TOWARDS THE FAILED ENGINE.”The airline company has been in a financial crisis for several years. Its financial health deteriorated especially after the Covid pandemic.Last year, it submitted a plan to the civil aviation body to switch to ATR-72-type aircraft and promised to maintain safety standards of the existing fleet until it imported the ATR planes. However, airline officials say they could not secure investment to replace their fleet.However, the civil aviation body overlooked the airline’s financial condition, which is obviously a major safety concern.“With Nepal’s key festival just over two months away, Saurya, which had a total of three aircraft, was planning a full maintenance of the Bombardier that crashed on Wednesday to remain afloat. The Bombardier CRJ200 had 200 engine hours left for full maintenance,” according to insiders. Full maintenance alone does not necessarily ensure full safety of flights.Now the airline is left with just one airworthy plane, and authorities are unlikely to allow the company to operate for the same reason. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli paid a rare visit to the crash site on Wednesday.Saurya Airlines had also laid off staff due to financial problems last year. Despite several attempts, the airline officials could not be reached for comments.According to insiders, poor aircraft maintenance could be one of the potential crash factors, as keeping planes airworthy is costly.Engineers who wrote “fit to fly” too died in the crash.Yet in the immediate aftermath of the crash, there is also a lot of confusion.Another aviation expert ruled out the possibility of poor maintenance. “The entire maintenance team was on the plane. Why would they be on a suicide mission if the plane was ill-maintained?”However, the crash has shed light on different aspects of regulatory failure.It was later found that among the entire maintenance team, two passengers [one child and a woman], the son and wife of a Saurya technician, were flown in the plane cleared for maintenance, which is against the rule.“This suggests the regulator’s negligence,” said Sanjiv Gautam, former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. “How can the regulator allow passengers on the ferry flight?

Be it a bronze, silver or even a gold.Nepali athletes will compete in seven different events at the 2024 Paris Olympics where they will be driven by a single goal—like in previous participations—to win at least one Olympic medal.The Summer Olympics in Paris officially kicks off on Friday.Long-distance runner Santoshi Shrestha, badminton player Prince Dahal, judoka Manita Shrestha Pradhan, shooter Sushmita Nepal, swimmers Alexander Shah and Duana Lama and table tennis player Santoo Shrestha will be representing Nepal at the Olympics in Paris this year.Nepal made their Olympics debut in 1964 by sending six athletes—marathon runners Bhupendra Bahadur and Ganga Bahadur Thapa, and boxers Namsing Thapa, Bhim Bahadur Thapa, Ram Prasad Gurung and Om Prasad Pun are Nepal’s first Olympians—to Tokyo and has competed in all Summer Olympics except Mexico 1968.-Unofficial medals-A total of 86 Nepali athletes have participated—in athletics, swimming, boxing, shooting, judo, weightlifting, archery and taekwondo—in the international multi-sport event before Paris, failing to make a breakthrough on each occasion.However, technically, Nepal has not been without a medal at the Games.Tejbir Bura is the first and the only Nepali to get a gold medal in Nepal’s Olympic history.Bura, a mountaineer from the Gurkha Regiment, was awarded a gold medal for his alpinism effort at the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix, France—the first ever Winter Olympics—as part of the 1922 British Mount Everest expedition. It was a mixed team and thus was not recognised as an official medal for Nepal.Bidhan Lama also won a bronze medal in Taekwondo at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. But this was an unofficial bronze medal as taekwondo was then an exhibition event.A total of 120 men and 62 women martial artists from 35 nations competed across eight different weight categories in the demonstration sport in Seoul. Lama defeated Ebenezer Ghansah of Great Britain in the men’s finweight (50kg) class in the round of 16, Choi Chan-ok of West Germany in the quarter-finals before losing to American Juan Miguel Moreno in the semis.Taekwondo entered the Olympics programme in Sydney 2000.Unfortunately, Nepal’s performance at the Olympics has so far been disappointing and winning a medal has been a distant dream. And, it has appeared that players from Nepal have mostly taken the Olympics platform either to gain international experience or set national records.After taekwondo was officially introduced at the Olympics, Sangina Baidya became the first Nepali player to qualify for the Olympics at Athens 2004 after she won a bronze medal in the Asian Qualifying Tournament in Bangkok, Thailand. Deepak Bista then won a bronze in the Asian qualifying event in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam to qualify for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Both Baidya (women’s 49 kg weight category) and Bista (men’s 80 kg) failed to get past the preliminary round, also losing the repechage events.-Can Santoo light up table tennis in Olympics debut?-But table tennis player Santoo could go a step further than Baidya and Bista in Paris.Santoo won men’s singles gold at the South Asian Qualification Tournament in Kathmandu in May this year, becoming only the third Nepali player to qualify for the Olympics—which also set the stage for Nepal’s debut in table tennis competition at the Games.Following the qualifying tournament in Kathmandu, Santoo returned to Australia, where he is pursuing a Master’s Degree in Information Technology, for further training.“Santoo has been preparing well. He has been sharing photos and videos of his regular training and getting feedback from us,” Santoo’s coach Rajendra Kapali told the Post. “He trained with stronger sparring partners in Australia, which has also improved his preparations for the Olympics,” Kapali added.Twenty-four-year-old Santoo Shrestha is the lowest seeded table tennis player among the 67 competitors in Paris and has been placed into the bottom place of the preliminary round.He will need to beat Diaw Ibrahima of Senegal in the preliminary round on July 27 to progress into the round of 64.Shrestha is a four-time national champion and the winner of one silver medal and four bronze medals at the 2019 South Asian Games. He had teamed up with his coach Nabita Shrestha at the SAG in the mixed doubles.“Santoo is an attacking player. He is a champion of the mind games and understands his opponents. I believe Santoo will present a tough challenge to his opponents,” Nabita said.-Introduction of badminton-Nepal is also making its debut in badminton in Paris, 32 years after the sport was officially included in the Olympics in Barcelona 1992.Dahal has been drawn in a tough Group P for the men’s singles competition alongside world number two Viktor Axelsen of Denmark, 2016 European U17 Championships Nhat Nguyen of Ireland and experienced Israeli Misha Zilberman, who was a bronze medallist at the European Badminton Championships in 2022. The 20-year-old Dahal, a winner of the 2018 Dubai International Junior Series, is at his prime. He rose to the top of Badminton World Federation’s list of men’s juniors in 2022. He is also a silver medallist at the 2019 South Asia U-21 Championships.“I have brought a lot of improvement in my game in the past six months. I am confident I can give a good fight in Paris,” said Dahal, who prepared for the Olympics in Sri Lanka.“It is good that I have been drawn with top players. I take this draw very positively. Win or lose… I will gain a lot of positives from the Olympics,” Dahal added.Dahal, who entered the Paris 2024 on universality spot, will begin his Olympics campaign against Axelsen on July 27 at the Porte de la Chapelle Arena.A total of 41 players (from 36 countries)—split into 13 groups of three or four—are competing in the men’s singles badminton at Paris 2024. The group winners will advance to the knockout stage. Each game of the round-robin tournament will be played in a best-of-three format. -‘Golden girl’-Nepal is also sending an athlete in the women’s marathon for the first time in 28 years.Last time, Bimala Rana Magar represented Nepal in the women’s marathon at Atlanta 1996. Nepal first sent its athletes in the women's marathon at Seoul 1988 when Raj Kumar Pandey and Menuka Rawat had taken part. Since Sydney 2000, Nepal has been participating only in short and middle distance events in women’s athletics.Santoshi, also known as ‘golden girl’, is going to revive Nepal’s marathon history at the Paris Olympics.The 30-year-old long distance runner started doing the marathon only in January this year but made it a fairytale debut by winning gold medal in the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Dhaka Marathon, also breaking the national record in the process. Santoshi took 2 hours 46 minutes and 23 seconds to complete the 42.195 kilometres distance, eclipsing the previous record held by Pushpa Bhandari.Santoshi said she aims to improve her record and is determined to complete the marathon in 2 hours and 40 minutes.“I am worried about the weather and the routes which could possibly be obstacles during the race. But I have been training off road, on pitch [asphalt] roads…everywhere to prepare for Paris,” added Santoshi, who was a gold medallist in the 10,000 metres race at the 13th South Asian Games.One major concern for Santoshi will be the metatarsal injury on her feet.“I have been careful with my injury while training. I have been attending therapy, gym and doing massage,” she added.Santoshi has won more than three dozen golds in domestic competitions.The women’s marathon takes place on August 11—the final day of Paris 2024.-Beyond Heat?-Nepal has traditionally been well represented in swimming at the Olympics since making its debut in 1996 Atlanta. Nisma Gurung and Sita Ram Shahi represented Nepal in Atlanta.Since then, ten more swimmers including Prasiddha Jung Shah, Nayana Shakya, Karishma Karki, Sirish Gurung, Gaurika Singh and Alexander Shah have participated at the Olympics.But their performances have been limited to setting national records and none of them have gone past the heat round.Alexander will be the third Nepali swimmer after Prasiddha (Beijing 2008 and London 2012) and Gaurika (Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020) to participate in the consecutive editions of the Olympics. Alexander will compete in the men's 100m freestyle in Paris.Baikuntha Manandhar appeared at the Olympics four successive times (Montreal 1976, Moscow 1980, Los Angeles 1984 and Seoul 1988) while Hari Bahadur Rokaya (Seoul 1988 and Barcelona 1992) and Tika Bogati (Seoul 1988 and Atlanta 1996) represented Nepal twice in athletics. Boxers Dal Bahadur Rana Magar (Los Angeles 1984 and Seoul 1988) also participated two times.Alexander holds the national record in men’s 100 m freestyle with a time of 52.17 seconds, which he set during the World Aquatics Champions in Doha. He had improved his own previous timing of 53.41 seconds set during Tokyo 2020.Duana Lama will compete in the women’s 200m freestyle and aim to break the record of 2 minutes 11.94 seconds set by Gaurika at the 20th National Swimming Championships in 2017.“Our target at the Olympics is to improve our national records. Given the preparations of Alexander and Duana, we will achieve that goal,” said former player and swimming coach Nayana Shakya, who participated in the 100m breaststroke at Athens 2004.The heats of the women’s 200m freestyle and men’s 100m freestyle will take place on July 28 and July 30 respectively.Judoka Manita Shrestha Pradhan and shooter Sushmita Nepal are the other players representing Nepal at the Paris 2024.Shrestha Pradhan, who qualified via continents quota based on Olympics point ranking, will compete in women’s 57 kg weight category. Her coach Deve Thapa, a former Olympican, hopes Shrestha Pradhan will win at least one bout in the competition.Shrestha Pradhan, 25, said she is ready to accept the challenge.“The Olympics is the biggest sporting stage. It is the dream of every athlete to participate at the Olympics. It was my dream too. I am prepared to challenge any opponent,” said Shrestha Pradhan.A total of 372 judokas will be competing across 14 weight categories in Paris. Men’s and women’s events will have an equal 186 participants. Judo competition begins on July 27.The 24-year-old Sushmita aims to break the national record in women’s 10m air rifle and get past the preliminary round.“I will try my best to get a good score. My target is to set a national record in the event and progress beyond the preliminary round,” said Sushmita.The shooting begins on July 28.

Nisma Gurung and Sita Ram Shahi represented Nepal in Atlanta.Since then, ten more swimmers including Prasiddha Jung Shah, Nayana Shakya, Karishma Karki, Sirish Gurung, Gaurika Singh and Alexander Shah have participated at the Olympics.But their performances have been limited to setting national records and none of them have gone past the heat round.Alexander will be the third Nepali swimmer after Prasiddha (Beijing 2008 and London 2012) and Gaurika (Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020) to participate in the consecutive editions of the Olympics. Alexander will compete in the men's 100m freestyle in Paris.Baikuntha Manandhar appeared at the Olympics four successive times (Montreal 1976, Moscow 1980, Los Angeles 1984 and Seoul 1988) while Hari Bahadur Rokaya (Seoul 1988 and Barcelona 1992) and Tika Bogati (Seoul 1988 and Atlanta 1996) represented Nepal twice in athletics. Boxers Dal Bahadur Rana Magar (Los Angeles 1984 and Seoul 1988) also participated two times.Alexander holds the national record in men’s 100 m freestyle with a time of 52.17 seconds, which he set during the World Aquatics Champions in Doha. He had improved his own previous timing of 53.41 seconds set during Tokyo 2020.Duana Lama will compete in the women’s 200m freestyle and aim to break the record of 2 minutes 11.94 seconds set by Gaurika at the 20th National Swimming Championships in 2017.“Our target at the Olympics is to improve our national records. Given the preparations of Alexander and Duana, we will achieve that goal,” said former player and swimming coach Nayana Shakya, who participated in the 100m breaststroke at Athens 2004.The heats of the women’s 200m freestyle and men’s 100m freestyle will take place on July 28 and July 30 respectively.Judoka Manita Shrestha Pradhan and shooter Sushmita Nepal are the other players representing Nepal at the Paris 2024.Shrestha Pradhan, who qualified via continents quota based on Olympics point ranking, will compete in women’s 57 kg weight category. Her coach Deve Thapa, a former Olympican, hopes Shrestha Pradhan will win at least one bout in the competition.Shrestha Pradhan, 25, said she is ready to accept the challenge.“The Olympics is the biggest sporting stage. It is the dream of every athlete to participate at the Olympics. It was my dream too. I am prepared to challenge any opponent,” said Shrestha Pradhan.A total of 372 judokas will be competing across 14 weight categories in Paris. Men’s and women’s events will have an equal 186 participants. Judo competition begins on July 27.The 24-year-old Sushmita aims to break the national record in women’s 10m air rifle and get past the preliminary round.“I will try my best to get a good score. My target is to set a national record in the event and progress beyond the preliminary round,” said Sushmita.The shooting begins on July 28.

This marks a regression from the previous term, when women held four out of 20 positions, which is already a low number. Such invisibilisation of women is concerning in a country where women comprise 51.1 percent of the population. The current composition of the Cabinet raises serious questions about Nepal and the newly appointed government's commitment to gender equality and social inclusion (GESI). It is not only the women who have been sidelined; there are no Dalits in Oli’s Cabinet.The recent appointments suggest that our political leaders no longer attempt to maintain the \"illusion of inclusion\" or \"tokenistic representation\", given that women’s representation in the Cabinet dropped from a low 20 percent to a concerning 9 percent. It reflects a serious lack of power position for women in political decision-making. If women still lack visible power in such leadership positions, is there any hope of an invisible or hidden power working in their favour? A mirage of inclusionHistorically, Nepali women’s exclusion from open spaces of power has been a common practice, with numerous women leaders having to fight battles against patriarchal norms. Women have struggled for the right to vote, inherit property, or even join the so-called male-dominated professions like politics. The exclusion of women representatives from political spaces further undermines their ability to claim any space. If women are continually shut out from high-level positions such as the Cabinet of Ministers, it is unlikely that hopeful youth can see meaningful representation. This situation sends an extremely disheartening message to young women who aspire to join political leadership in a federal and democratic Nepal. The fact that the political ambitions of many women may be unattainable in a system that perpetuates patriarchy and misogyny is severely demoralising.A power cube framework explains that women can access power in certain spaces, forms and levels while others remain inaccessible. In terms of power levels, since time immemorial, women have predominantly exerted influence at the household level. However, through activism and women’s rights movements at the local, national and international levels (creating a pyramid of power), dents have been made to rightly put a few women in decision-making positions. In the last elections, female representatives at the local level (elected and nominated) comprised approximately 14,465 out of 35,097. In contrast, at the national level (National Assembly and House of Representatives), there were just 115 women out of 334 elected representatives. This difference underscores how structures of hidden inequality perpetuate gendered power dynamics, which are distinctly unequal. In terms of forms of power and spaces claimed by women, they tend to emphasise the structural, discursive and symbolic barriers women face. Structurally, women have historically held fewer formal positions of power, and the current Cabinet composition only reinforces this disparity. Discursively, women's issues are often sidelined or superficially addressed in political discourse, lacking the depth and seriousness they deserve. Symbolically, fewer women in power send a detrimental message about the perceived capabilities and roles of women in leadership, further entrenching gender biases as well as imposter syndrome. The barriers withinAt a personal level, the individual experiences and challenges female political leaders face in positions of power are critical. They must navigate a predominantly male environment, facing biases and obstacles in their work alongside manoeuvering petty politics often thrown at them by subordinates with conscious/sub-conscious patriarchal mindsets. Institutionally, political parties and other actors promote or hinder women's decision-making. The lack of proactive measures to ensure women's active representation and participation indicates a failure at the institutional level to support gender equality and inclusion. Societally, public perceptions and cultural attitudes toward women in leadership remain a significant barrier, with deep-seated patriarchal norms and values that continue to undermine women's political ambitions and achievements.Nepal's regression is part of a global and regional trend of declining women's political representation and rising right-wing sentiments. Only 13 percent of countries have effectively implemented gender quotas, resulting in disparities in women's political representation. Globally, women make up just 23.3 percent of Cabinet ministers. In South Asia, India's local-level progress hasn't translated nationally, with only 74 women making up the 2024 Lok Sabha. Our situation mirrors these global trends, where political, social and cultural factors undermine equality. Right-wing populist governments often exacerbate this issue by prioritising traditional gender roles and enacting policies that undermine gender equality. But this narrative sets the world back to times before the First Wave of Feminism and hence, second-class citizenship.Compared to the previous term, the 45 percent reduction in women's representation in the Cabinet is a significant step backwards and must not be ignored. In Nepal, the electoral representation system mandates that women hold 33 percent of seats in federal and provincial parliaments and 40 percent in local governments. Despite these measures, women remain significantly underrepresented in executive roles. This raises pertinent questions regarding our leaders’ sense of accountability, as it seems they no longer care about the optics of representation, at the very least. Concerns about whether party-heavy agendas and personal gain have led to the dismissal of issues concerning women and social minorities must be addressed.Reclaiming political spacesNepal seems to be struggling to move beyond the second wave of feminism, which focuses on legal inequalities, to the third wave and beyond, which addresses broader issues of inclusivity and intersectionality. Unsurprisingly, both women in the new Cabinet come from upper-caste Brahmin-Chettri communities, which yet again pose questions about the representation of women from marginalised communities that are severely lacking in top-ministerial positions. Who will remind the patriarchally inclined leaders of the history of hard work and contributions of women leaders to public life, which the former seem so conveniently to erase or forget?The current state of the Cabinet is not just a disappointment; it is an outrage. It signals a potential reversal of the efforts toward creating a more inclusive and equitable Nepali society. We must question whether our leaders are actively perpetuating the false narrative that 'women are not interested in politics' or 'not capable enough to navigate the complexity of the domain' by erasing their opportunities to claim leadership roles in the first place. And whether this tactic is aimed at further silencing women leaders.This underrepresentation profoundly impacts the potential for generational progress and the overall ecosystem of progressive development. It also restricts the diversity of perspectives in decision-making processes, which is crucial for formulating comprehensive and inclusive policies. Research by the UN Women indicates that gender-diverse leadership teams tend to foster more innovative and effective governance strategies, contributing to more equitable and sustainable societal outcomes. The systemic exclusion of women from high-level political roles not only undermines the democratic principle of equal representation but also stifles the social and economic advancements that arise from inclusive leadership.It is time political actors recognised the importance of representational leadership and took concrete steps to ensure that women, particularly those from marginalised communities, have a seat at the table and real decision-making powers. Alongside 'shattering the glass ceiling,' the phenomenon of climbing the ‘broken ladder’ must be mended.

A potential shortage of these items will lead to a rise in unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions and maternal and neonatal deaths.Multiple officials at the Ministry of Health complained that it has been too difficult to convince officials at the Finance Ministry about the importance of family planning programmes.“Most officials think that the country’s population witnessed the lowest growth in eight decades, so continuation of family planning programmes is not necessary,” an official at the Health Ministry said on condition of anonymity, as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “But decline in population growth rate and providing family planning services are totally two different things.”Nepal’s population growth rate stood at 0.92 percent per annum in the past decade, according to officials.“The growth rate of the population has declined due to various factors, including internal and external migration,” said Dr Prakash Dev Panta, a demographer. “However, the fertility rate has not declined. If authorities stop family planning services, then again unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and maternal and neonatal deaths will rise, which have reduced over the years after making huge investments in the programmes.”The UNFPA’s “State of World Population 2022” report titled, “Seeing the Unseen”, says half of the 1.2 million pregnancies in 2017 in Nepal were unintended and nearly 359,000 were aborted.“Unintended pregnancy is a reality for millions each year, accounting for nearly half of all pregnancies,” said the UNFPA’s report. “Sixty percent of these unintended pregnancies will end in abortion.”The UN agency’s report stated that the toll of these pregnancies is—and has for long been—unseen. “Though we can estimate healthcare costs, monitor school dropout rates and project levels of workforce attrition due to unintended pregnancies, these only scratch the surface. No number could adequately represent the loss of life, agency and human capital that results from unintended pregnancies,” the report added.Unintended pregnancy is often, tragically, linked to violence.

This commitment includes improving access to rights-based family planning services and reducing the unmet need for contraceptives.Last year, too, the Health Ministry, due to a fund crunch, borrowed 50,000 contraceptive implants from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).

Similarly, Unified Socialist has yet to name its 206 central committee members and 18 office bearers, according to party leaders.Political observers and analysts say that delaying the convention process to elect central committee and committee members reflects a decline in internal democracy within political parties.“Usually, a party’s general convention is a platform for its members, but if it turns into a rubber-stamp session, party leaders gain more control,” Keshav Dahal, a political analyst, told the Post. “When leaders want to fill party committees with their allies and confidants, it is often easier through direct appointments than through proper voting.” Dahal added that because every party has its factions, leaders often stall the selection process to manage these groups, which is why the selection process takes time, Dahal said.The Unified Socialist had issued a circular during its convention held in Kathmandu, instructing the selection of the remaining committee members and central committee members within 10 days of the conclusion of the convention. But even after more than two weeks, it has failed to fill the positions. As many as 1,849 representatives from across the country had participated in the party's national convention last month. But instead of electing central committee members through a vote, it opted for a consensus model. The party, which was established in August 2021 after a split from CPN-UML, feared that holding elections might polarise representatives and weaken the party. The praesidium chairman of the party's National Convention, Jhala Nath Khanal, announced a 93-member central committee from the Convention hall on the same day he was elected as senior leader. As per the statute of the party, Unified Socialist will have a 299-member central committee including 21 officers. This means the party still needs to appoint 206 out of 299 central committee members and 18 out of 21 committee members. Additionally, the party must also finalise its standing and politburo members.Party leaders say the election process for the remaining central committee members and other positions will begin at the party meeting on July 25. “Since the party leaders were busy compiling the information needed for selecting central committee members, the party missed the appointment deadline,” Jeevan Ram Shrestha, a party leader, told the Post. “The party has a set criteria for selecting central committee members, and we have gathered related information from every district. The process to make the appointments will begin at the party meeting on Thursday [July 25].”The Upendra Yadav-led JSP-Nepal concluded its unity general convention on June 12, but even a month later, it has not elected party committee members. Though the party released the names of 215 central committee members and a nine-member central executive committee on July 11, almost a month after concluding its convention, it has yet to name its office bearers.At the unity convention held in Janakpur from June 10 to June 12, Yadav was unanimously selected as the party's central chairman and was entrusted with the responsibility of selecting officials and central members. “Our party has a nine-member central executive committee, however, we are yet to select the office bearers,” Prakash Adhikari, a federal lawmaker from the party and a member of the nine-member central executive committee, told the Post. “It will take us a few more days to finalise the office bearers.”Before the party decided to halt the election process, 23 candidates—17 men and six women—had filed their candidacies for the five positions of vice chairpersons; six candidates were vying for two general secretary posts, and 12 candidates—nine men and three women—had filed their candidacies for the three deputy general secretary positions.Besides, three leaders were in the fray for the treasurer position, and 34 leaders were contesting for seven secretary positions.

Additionally, the party must also finalise its standing and politburo members.Party leaders say the election process for the remaining central committee members and other positions will begin at the party meeting on July 25. “Since the party leaders were busy compiling the information needed for selecting central committee members, the party missed the appointment deadline,” Jeevan Ram Shrestha, a party leader, told the Post. “The party has a set criteria for selecting central committee members, and we have gathered related information from every district. The process to make the appointments will begin at the party meeting on Thursday [July 25].”The Upendra Yadav-led JSP-Nepal concluded its unity general convention on June 12, but even a month later, it has not elected party committee members. Though the party released the names of 215 central committee members and a nine-member central executive committee on July 11, almost a month after concluding its convention, it has yet to name its office bearers.At the unity convention held in Janakpur from June 10 to June 12, Yadav was unanimously selected as the party's central chairman and was entrusted with the responsibility of selecting officials and central members. “Our party has a nine-member central executive committee, however, we are yet to select the office bearers,” Prakash Adhikari, a federal lawmaker from the party and a member of the nine-member central executive committee, told the Post. “It will take us a few more days to finalise the office bearers.”Before the party decided to halt the election process, 23 candidates—17 men and six women—had filed their candidacies for the five positions of vice chairpersons; six candidates were vying for two general secretary posts, and 12 candidates—nine men and three women—had filed their candidacies for the three deputy general secretary positions.Besides, three leaders were in the fray for the treasurer position, and 34 leaders were contesting for seven secretary positions.

That the ruling parties had blown the issue out of proportion 18 months after the letter addressed to the embassy made it clear that it was politically motivated, he claimed. Deputy Speaker Rana on February 26 last year wrote a letter to the US Embassy, requesting visa interviews for herself and five others. She faces pressure to quit, after the letter was leaked recently.She requested the embassy to arrange interview dates for six people, including herself. Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar, and Dhan Prasad Gurung were the other people named in the letter. Rana had written that she wanted the interview dates to be preponed as they were attending the 67th session of the Commission on the Status of Women, scheduled to be held in New York from March 6 to 17, 2023. Experts and retired parliamentary officials criticised her for corresponding with diplomatic agencies without informing the Parliament Secretariat and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.After the central committee meeting on Thursday, RSP officials tried to downplay the issue saying that their inquiry had found that the letter hadn’t been registered at the US Embassy in Kathmandu.“The letter has not been registered at the embassy. Nor do we have the evidence of any financial dealings,” said Jha.On July 21, RSP lawmaker Sumana Shrestha, defending Rana in Parliament, said that a media trial was underway to assassinate the character of the Deputy Speaker. Shrestha had said they were ready to leave the post if the ruling parties asked for it. “If you need a seat on the Constitutional Council, ask for it. But a woman’s character should not be assassinated in this manner,” Shrestha had said. After the central committee meeting on Thursday, Jha said allegations against Deputy Speaker Rana were discussed in the central committee.“We challenge the other parties to prove that the letter was registered at the Embassy,” Jha told the Post. “During our informal investigation, we found that no recommendation letter by Rana was registered at the US Embassy.” He added that the letter was dated 18 months ago, and no one was found to have taken any benefits from the recommendation. Her intentions were not wrong, Jha said.Since the deputy Speaker is no longer a member of the party, RSP was not in a position to make any organisational decision related to her, he added.“Complaints against her have been filed to the Parliament Secretariat and the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the legislature.

Can the Deputy Speaker still command Parliament?\" he asked. \"There is the Parliament Secretariat to facilitate the visa process if anyone of Parliament has to travel abroad. The Deputy Speaker has breached the norm by writing the letter herself.\"He claimed Rana's move had brought shame not just to Parliament but the whole country. \"The Deputy Speaker's Office cannot act as a consultancy to facilitate the visa process,\" he said.On February 26, 2023 she had written to the consular general at the Embassy of the United States in Kathmandu to arrange interview dates for six people including herself. Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar and Dhan Prasad Gurung were the other people named in the letter.Rana wrote that as they were attending the 67th session of the Commission on the Status of Women that was being held in New York on March 6 to 17, 2023, she wanted the interview dates to be preponed. She is now being criticised for misusing her position to make undiplomatic requests.Deputy Speaker, a constitutional position, is an ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council that recommends chiefs and members of constitutional bodies and the chief justice.Opposition lawmakers, however, claimed that the issue was blown out of proportion because the ruling alliance is in a minority in the Constitutional Council. Sumana Shrestha, a Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) lawmaker, said Rana's character was being assassinated because the ruling alliance is in a minority in the Constitutional Council. The council has two members each from the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre), one from the RSP and the next is the chief justice.\"Ask for [Rana's] support, we can give. But can you ruin the character of someone by calling them a human trafficker [because the ruling alliance is in a minority]?\" she asked. \"Character assisination is unacceptable. Let us check how everyone has used their letterheads in the past.”She said there must be the criteria for using the letter. She accused the major parties of resorting to a media trial of the deputy Speaker.Stating that the world knows how a lawmaker behaved in Parliament and on the streets demanding visa for an individual, she said the current criticism was nothing but a planned move against Rana. Gyan Bahadur Shahi, a Rastriya Prajatantra Party lawmaker, had led a mass protest against the US Embassy for denying visa to cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane.Though there can be moral questions for writing the letter, Madhav Sapkota, a CPN (Maoist Centre) lawmaker, said, the way the letter was brought to the public domain now gives enough room to suspect the motive.\"We condemn the move if it is being done with an aim to bulldoze decisions from the Constitutional Council,\" he said. \"As an opposition party, we will strongly oppose such moves.\" Rana also claims that there have been coordinated attempts to attack her. Issuing a statement on Friday, she said, “The attempt to scandalise the letter I wrote out of compassion, after a year and a half, is nothing but a move orchestrated against me,” reads the letter.“Those who know me well are aware of my nature. I may have many personal shortcomings, and there may be many who try to take advantage of that, but I have never engaged in unethical actions, nor will I ever do.\" Experts in the field say the issue is not as light as Rana is trying to portray.Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, said the deputy Speaker must be held accountable for her act.It would be hasty to conclude that writing the letter was an act of human trafficking, Thapa told the Post. “But it is clearly a misuse of authority.\"Rana must take responsibility for her wrongdoings, he said. Writing for herself was not a problem but including the names of those who are not related to Parliament in any way is problematic, Thapa argued.An official at the secretariat claimed that Rana had tried to get the secretariat to write the letter. That didn't happen as then-general secretary Bharat Raj Gautam didn't agree to it, said the official. \"She wrote the letter herself as the general secretary refused to involve the parliament secretariat in it.\" ","summary":"The ruling and opposition parties have started a blame game over Deputy Speaker Indira Rana's move to write a letter to the American Embassy in Kathmandu to allocate convenient visa interview dates for individuals without clear statuses.While some ruling party lawmakers demanded a probe into the matter, opposition lawmakers including those from the Rastriya Swatantra Party said it was a non issue.During the special time in the House of Representatives on Sunday, Nepali Congress lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada demanded a committee to probe the correspondence by Rana.\"A letter requesting dates for US visas has been received.

Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar and Dhan Prasad Gurung were the other people named in the letter.Rana wrote that as they were attending the 67th session of the Commission on the Status of Women that was being held in New York on March 6 to 17, 2023, she wanted the interview dates to be preponed. She is now being criticised for misusing her position to make undiplomatic requests.Deputy Speaker, a constitutional position, is an ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council that recommends chiefs and members of constitutional bodies and the chief justice.Opposition lawmakers, however, claimed that the issue was blown out of proportion because the ruling alliance is in a minority in the Constitutional Council. Sumana Shrestha, a Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) lawmaker, said Rana's character was being assassinated because the ruling alliance is in a minority in the Constitutional Council. The council has two members each from the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre), one from the RSP and the next is the chief justice.\"Ask for [Rana's] support, we can give. But can you ruin the character of someone by calling them a human trafficker [because the ruling alliance is in a minority]?\" she asked. \"Character assisination is unacceptable. Let us check how everyone has used their letterheads in the past.”She said there must be the criteria for using the letter. She accused the major parties of resorting to a media trial of the deputy Speaker.Stating that the world knows how a lawmaker behaved in Parliament and on the streets demanding visa for an individual, she said the current criticism was nothing but a planned move against Rana. Gyan Bahadur Shahi, a Rastriya Prajatantra Party lawmaker, had led a mass protest against the US Embassy for denying visa to cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane.Though there can be moral questions for writing the letter, Madhav Sapkota, a CPN (Maoist Centre) lawmaker, said, the way the letter was brought to the public domain now gives enough room to suspect the motive.\"We condemn the move if it is being done with an aim to bulldoze decisions from the Constitutional Council,\" he said. \"As an opposition party, we will strongly oppose such moves.\" Rana also claims that there have been coordinated attempts to attack her. Issuing a statement on Friday, she said, “The attempt to scandalise the letter I wrote out of compassion, after a year and a half, is nothing but a move orchestrated against me,” reads the letter.“Those who know me well are aware of my nature. I may have many personal shortcomings, and there may be many who try to take advantage of that, but I have never engaged in unethical actions, nor will I ever do.\" Experts in the field say the issue is not as light as Rana is trying to portray.Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, said the deputy Speaker must be held accountable for her act.It would be hasty to conclude that writing the letter was an act of human trafficking, Thapa told the Post. “But it is clearly a misuse of authority.\"Rana must take responsibility for her wrongdoings, he said. Writing for herself was not a problem but including the names of those who are not related to Parliament in any way is problematic, Thapa argued.An official at the secretariat claimed that Rana had tried to get the secretariat to write the letter. That didn't happen as then-general secretary Bharat Raj Gautam didn't agree to it, said the official. \"She wrote the letter herself as the general secretary refused to involve the parliament secretariat in it.\" "},{"hash":"68554eec221355a3da6e07d43f43a05aea850a9ed1992b4b7b825c761383d68e","title":"petition-against-oli-s-appointment-forwarded-to-constitutional-bench","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/07/21/petition-against-oli-s-appointment-forwarded-to-constitutional-bench","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/thumb1-1721559372.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1721520000000,"source":"kp","category":"politics","content":"The constitutional bench of the Supreme Court will hear a writ petition challenging the appointment of CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli as prime minister.A single bench of Justice Bal Krishna Dhakal on Sunday forwarded the case to the constitutional bench, citing the need for a ‘serious constitutional interpretation’.“The matter raised in the writ petition involves serious questions of constitutional interpretation, and its resolution should be done by the constitutional bench.

While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesn’t just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. “They need options that won’t affect their income; a crackdown won’t work.”Dawadi emphasises that KMC shouldn’t view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure ‘disabled-friendly.’ Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. “People with disabilities should be involved in planning,” she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.“On many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,” he explains. “The footpath has become just a showpiece.”Rishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmandu’s footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministry’s Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMC’s recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishi’s organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.“The constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,” Adhikari said. “Forget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.”Rishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, “forcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.” This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.“Despite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,” Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. “This reflects a major failure of the state’s duty,” he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the country’s road infrastructure. “We don’t know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,” she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. “Without clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, it’s hard for us to find our destinations,” Ray says. “As I can’t hear, I rely on signs for guidance.”Ray also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. “Crossing the road can be chaotic,” he notes. “With drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.”Ray was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didn’t suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMC’s new footpaths and railings are a step forward but “they are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.”According to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term ‘disabled-friendly’ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an ‘inclusivity checklist’ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. “What about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?” he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. “There’s no guidance or facilities for us,” she said.Shrestha criticises the KMC’s approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. “Construction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,” he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. “While we’re committed to making footpaths accessible, we’re not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,” he said.“We’ve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we can’t address every issue alone.”Baburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. “We are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,” he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.“We’ve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmandu’s pavements and roads, but that doesn’t mean they’re not problematic,” Kumal says. “Accessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.” ","summary":"In Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions.

Officials said the move aims to ensure smooth transfer of waste as roads to the landfill often become impassable during the monsoon, preventing the passage of garbage trucks.“We have deployed three excavators, two bulldozers and two loaders to clear landslide debris along the road to the Bancharedanda landfill,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. “Also, we have kept five more vehicles on standby for immediate deployment if needed.”Every year, during monsoon season, the road to landfill sites gets obstructed in multiple places, obstructing the transfer of house waste collected in the three districts of the capital city—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Apart from these, some local levels of Kavrepalanchok also discard garbage at the landfill site at Bancharedanda.The metropolis officials said that they had purchased 10 high-pressure pumps to drain floodwaters from inundated settlements.“Five pumps have already been sent to the high-risk areas along riversides,” said Shrestha. “These can quickly pump away floodwaters.”The city office started repairing the Sisdole road leading to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district just a few weeks before the start of the monsoon. Officials said Rs30 million had been allocated for repairs, which included fixing potholes, concreting roads, and other works.Around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised, according to officials.Besides monsoon-induced road obstructions, garbage disposal is sometimes disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions cause weeks-long halt to door-to-door garbage collection, leading people in the Valley to discard their trash on streets.Officials said that a high-pressure pump is being used to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground.Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The City office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.The city office recently sold non-degradable waste worth Rs700,000.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled.

Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.“Every Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,” said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. “Decisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.

The policy aims to ramp up support for the economy, which has been slowing, said Adhikari. “The policy targets gradual economic recovery by controlling inflation, stabilising interest rates, and ensuring credit demand.”The central bank said monetary policy had transitioned to an “easing, cautious” mode to address the demand of the private sector, which is the driver of economic growth.With easing measures, the central bank expects a double-digit private sector credit growth, increasing by 12.5 percent year-on-year in 2024-25.“The monetary policy is favourable for the private sector. It aims at economic recovery through productive use of private-sector credit,” said Chandra Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the apex private sector body. “There was a problem. Money had piled up in banks, and businesses were not getting it to invest. The policy has untied the knot.”The central bank said the private sector pumped Rs5.27 trillion into the economy in the last fiscal year, which ended on July 15. This accounts for 92 percent of Nepal’s economy.The growth of the construction sector also stalled in the period. In the last fiscal year, the sector, with a contribution of 5.41 percent to the economy, is projected to have dropped to 2.07 percent. To address the sector’s grievances, the monetary policy has extended the interest payment deadline for contractors to November.“It’s welcoming, though it is late,” said Rabi Singh, president of the Federation of Contractors’ Associations of Nepal. “But this is just a temporary arrangement.”“We had recommended the government for recapitalisation of the loans and interest for 2 to 5 years to stabilise the construction industry’s capital structure,” he said.The government defaulted on payment for contractors, forcing hundreds of projects to halt and eventually cause the construction sector, one of the key economic indicators, to enter a recession. “Still, we need the assurance of enough cash flow for the development of the critical infrastructure, which is also the basis for jobs creation.”Singh said the construction sector has been working on projects amounting to Rs600 billion.The central bank said the measures to cut interest rates are intended to enhance market liquidity and support economic activity in a low-inflation environment. The upper ceiling interest rate corridor has been decreased by 0.5 percentage points to 6.5 percent, and the policy rate has been reduced by 0.5 percent, to 5 percent.According to market analysts, if banks’ interest rates are low, people generally tend to invest. This will allow liquidity injections in the market without it being absorbed by the banks and the central bank.The monetary policy stated that the high liquidity in the banking system would support businesses and individuals and ease the difficulties of the private sector.The central bank said mobilising the banks’ liquidity through the private sector would support the federal government’s ambitious economic growth target. “This monetary policy will help us reach the 6 percent economic growth targeted by the federal government by keeping inflation at around 5 percent,” said Governor Adhikari. He said the central bank would manage liquidity and inject capital into the productive sector to achieve the target growth.According to the annual account estimates by the National Statistics Office, Nepal’s economic growth was estimated at 3.87 percent in the last fiscal year, in an optimistic scenario.The World Bank said in its April Nepal Development Update that economic growth is projected to accelerate to 4.6 percent in the current fiscal year, a way below the government target.“This recovery is largely attributed to the easing of monetary policy, assuming the productive use of private-sector credit,” the multilateral funding agency said. “Private sector credit contracted in the last fiscal year due to the tighter regulation on working capital loans, high lending rates, and weak domestic demand.”“The reforms to improve the business environment could attract more private investment,” according to the World Bank.On Friday, the central bank announced it would review the current working capital loans guideline. Banks and financial institutions offer short-term working capital loans to finance a company’s everyday operations.At present, industrialists and businesspeople get working capital loans of up to 25 percent of their annual turnover.For those taking more working capital loans than the set threshold, the deadline for borrowers to repay the excess credit has been extended to mid-July 2025. The central bank said it aims to maintain seven months of forex reserves to cover goods and services imports in the ongoing fiscal year 2024-25. The central bank said it would coordinate with the government to formulate necessary laws to regulate and supervise savings and credit cooperatives.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has flagged a risk to Nepal’s economy that could trigger social unrest if the ongoing cooperatives problems are not sorted out.It said that several cooperatives have collapsed in the past six months, causing a loss or freezing of client savings and creating small-scale social unrest. The IMF warned that problems in the savings and cooperatives sector are expanding.The leading cause of the failure is investment in illiquid and underperforming cooperatives’ assets, which impact repayment capacity, combined with some cases of fraud.The monetary policy said it would facilitate the government’s initiative to return Rs500,000 to each cooperatives depositor by recovering them from the directors’ properties.With a growing number of companies being blacklisted, the central bank said it had worked out a policy for the companies that are associated with the blacklisted companies but have not committed any offence.Under the policy, if one firm is blacklisted in a joint venture, it will not be mandatory to keep the other in the bad book if it has committed no offence.At present, if a person or organisation that is blacklisted owns 15 percent or more shares in any other firm, personally or institutionally, the director and executive head of such a firm or company can also be blacklisted. The central bank said it would provide collateral-free loans to migrant workers based on the assurance that remittances would be sent to the bank accounts in their home country.The NRB has extended the deadline for loan repayment to microfinance customers who failed to pay loans under various circumstances. Monetary policy has increased the limit on home loans. The bank said that the limit on home loans taken for the first time would be increased to Rs25 million from Rs20 million. It has increased the foreign exchange limit for Demand Draft/Telex Transfer facilities when importing goods to $50,000 from the existing $35,000.The existing limit for importing goods through ‘document against payment’ and ‘document against acceptance’ has been increased from $60,000 to $100,000.The monetary policy has removed the limit on share mortgage loans for institutions, which is currently Rs200 million. However, no new provision has been made on personal or individual loan limits. Currently, the share mortgage loan limit for individuals is Rs150 million, and individual share investors have been demanding an increase in this limit.  ","summary":"Nepal’s private sector has been sailing in troubled waters.

Ekata Vyas, who campaigns on behalf of the Nepali students—estimated to number at least 60—told the Post that she is hoping for positive results this time. She has received positive feedback and responses from New Delhi and the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu. The monthly stipend ranges from IRs 90,000 to 1,20,000.Besides taking up the matter, the foreign national doctors, mostly from Nepal, took up the issue before 2011. According to the Nepali doctors who are serving in AIIMS, a case was filed in the Delhi High Court against the discriminatory provision over the stipends and arrears in 2011. The Delhi Court gave its verdict in favour of the students on July 16. In 2013, however, the AIIMS filed a counter case which was made absolute on December 4, 2017, after 27 hearings, most of them just formalities marked by absences on the bench and of defendants.

The Indian Embassy in Kathmandu also confirmed to India’s Ministry of External Affairs that Indian students in similar courses are getting stipends equal to their Nepali counterparts from their respective institutions in Nepal.

The presence of faecal coliform means that the drinking water being used by locals of Thaiba is contaminated with sewage, according to doctors.At least four people had tested positive for cholera that spread in the Thaiba-based rehab earlier this week.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient.Of the four infected patients, one in serious condition was admitted to the intensive care unit of the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Teku, Kathmandu. Another patient, who was admitted in the same hospital, was discharged on Wednesday, but has not gone home because the rehab has closed and he has nowhere else to go. Faecal coliform had also been detected in the study carried out on water samples collected from Godawari Municipality before the onset of monsoon.As monsoon season is an epidemic season, in which most sources of drinking water get contaminated, presence of deadly microbes—E coli, faecal coliform in drinking water is not unusual during the monsoon season, health officials say. Even jar water, which is widely considered safer compared to water from other sources, gets contaminated during the monsoon season.What concerns them much is the apathy of the responsible agencies in launching awareness drives about the risks and other preventive measures. Most local authorities across the country halted testing of drinking water just before the start of monsoon citing budget constraints.Doctors say this is not the first time that the water used by people in the Valley was found contaminated with potentially deadly microbes. What concerns them more is that water quality has not improved significantly.“Consumption of water contaminated with human faeces causes diarrheal infections,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “Whatever the source, one must ensure that water is safe before drinking.”According to Basaula, the number of diarrheal cases has started rising in the hospital, and contaminated water and food are the main culprits. He said there are chances of outbreaks of diarrheal infections in multiple places where water from contaminated sources is being distributed.“Around six diarrheal patients seek treatment in our hospital every day,” said Basaula. “One must be careful about the quality of food and water before consumption.”Doctors say consumption of contaminated water not only causes diarrheal infections and deadly cholera but also increases the chances of contracting dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.Initiating awareness drives and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to save people from water-borne diseases, according to them. A combination of careful surveys, provision of safe drinking water, good sanitation and hygiene standards, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of infection, they say. ","summary":"Drinking water samples collected from the “Drugs-Free Society”, a Thaiba-based rehab hit by a cholera outbreak, have tested positive for faecal coliform.Officials at the Health Office Lalitpur, have reported the presence of the deadly microbes in all water samples including those from the water utility and well water.“Faecal coliform, a deadly microbe, has been detected in all water samples from the cholera-hit rehab,”said Shree Bhadra Sharma, a lab technician at the Health Office Lalitpur. “We have started chlorinating the water to tackle the contamination.”Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, lives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces. The presence of faecal coliform means that the drinking water being used by locals of Thaiba is contaminated with sewage, according to doctors.At least four people had tested positive for cholera that spread in the Thaiba-based rehab earlier this week.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient.Of the four infected patients, one in serious condition was admitted to the intensive care unit of the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Teku, Kathmandu. Another patient, who was admitted in the same hospital, was discharged on Wednesday, but has not gone home because the rehab has closed and he has nowhere else to go. Faecal coliform had also been detected in the study carried out on water samples collected from Godawari Municipality before the onset of monsoon.As monsoon season is an epidemic season, in which most sources of drinking water get contaminated, presence of deadly microbes—E coli, faecal coliform in drinking water is not unusual during the monsoon season, health officials say.

An additional 60 people who came in close contact with the deceased have been identified as a high-risk group by local health authorities, according to media reports.This is the fifth outbreak of Nipah virus in Kerala since 2018, according to media reports. Last year too, health authorities in India confirmed at least two deaths and three other cases of the viral infection, including a child, in the southern Indian state.Nipah is a zoonotic virus, transmitted from animals to humans, and causes a lethal swelling of the brain in humans. Transmission generally occurs when people come in close contact with infected animals or through the consumption of the meat of infected animals, according to doctors. The World Health Organisation has classified the Nipah virus as a priority pathogen due to its potential to trigger an epidemic.Transmission generally occurs when people come in direct contact with infected animals—pigs, fruit bats or through consumption of contaminated foods and meat of infected animals, according to health officials. Doctors say cases of human-to-human transmission of the virus have also been reported in many places, including in India, among the families and caregivers of the infected people.Health officials said no treatment for the Nipah virus is available. Without a vaccine having been developed, health workers provide symptomatic treatments only. “We have alerted all our sentinel sites across the country to the risks,” said Ojha. “Health workers are requested to send samples of the suspects for lab testing.”Doctors say Nepal is at risk of an outbreak of the Nipah virus, as fruit bats, which are the primary hosts of the virus, might also be present there. The Nipah virus was first detected in 1999 after farmers and others who came in close contact with infected pigs in Malaysia and Singapore developed severe respiratory problems and inflammation in the brain.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 300 people were diagnosed with the disease then, and more than 100 of them died.Experts said that authorities should take the issue seriously as the virus is far deadlier than the coronavirus, with up to 75 percent death rate in humans. “The virus is much more infectious and deadlier than other respiratory viruses currently in circulation,” Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, told the Post. “Even if the primary hosts of the virus are fruit bats and pigs, this virus is transmitted from human to human through secretion and excretion. The authorities must step up surveillance.”Doctors say that fruit bats from India, which carry the Nipah virus, can easily enter Nepal due to the proximity and similar environments. Moreover, due to the free movement of people between the two countries, there is always a high chance of any disease seen in India entering Nepal.The incubation period of Nipah infection is 4 to 14 days, and its symptoms include fever, headache, convulsions, and respiratory and neurological problems.The World Health Organisation said that although the virus has caused only a few known outbreaks in Asia, it infects a wide range of animals and causes severe disease and death in people, making it a public health concern.

I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified.

I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff.

Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. ","summary":"“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood.

Many voters had arrived before dawn.“I work cleaning houses and my four grandchildren depend on me. I earn just $15 per week and that is enough to eat one day but not the next,” said Luisa Gonzalez, 61, who voted in the state of Bolivar, traditionally a ruling party bastion.“We have spent years looking for change. I was a Chavista, but people have changed,” she said, using the term for ruling party supporters, a reference to the late President Hugo Chavez.Maduro’s government has presided over an economic collapse, the migration of about a third of the population, and a sharp deterioration in diplomatic relations, crowned by sanctions imposed by the United States, the European Union and others which have crippled an already struggling oil industry.Maduro said if returned to power he would guarantee peace and economic growth, making Venezuela less dependent on oil income.Dozens of voters cast ballots at the Venezuelan consulate in the Spanish island of Tenerife, with others gathered outside waving flags and cheering. Migrants around the world reported difficulties registering and only a small percentage of the large Venezuelan diaspora was expected to be able to vote.The Chavez legacyMaduro voted early in the morning in Caracas and said the result announced by the National Electoral Council would be recognized and defended by the armed forces and the police.Maduro said he would decree a national dialogue on Monday, using a term that typically means conversations between the government and opposition, businesses, communities and others.Many Maduro supporters speak enthusiastically of his mentor Chavez, and see Maduro, in power since Chavez’s death in 2013, as a continuation of Chavez’s legacy of helping the poor.Others told Reuters they saw Maduro’s record as mixed but that they would back him.“There are things that without doubt need to improve in our country, but this government has lived through sanctions and blockades like no other. That’s why I back President Maduro and think he deserves another chance,” said Jose Lopez, 57, as he waited to vote in central Valencia.Gonzalez and Machado have promised major changes and said a fresh start may motivate migrants to return. The two opposition leaders have said they expect the military to uphold the results of the vote.Venezuela’s military has always supported Maduro, a 61-year-old former bus driver and foreign minister, and there have been no public signs that leaders of the armed forces are breaking from the government.Thirty-seven people have been arbitrarily detained since Friday in connection with the elections, Gonzalo Himiob, the vice president of human rights organization Foro Penal, said on X, and at least 20 remain detained. ","summary":"Venezuelans were awaiting results late on Sunday in the most consequential election in a quarter-century of socialist party rule, with President Nicolas Maduro confident of victory even as the opposition has attracted impassioned support and warned of possible irregularities.Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado has been the star of the coalition campaign, despite a ban on her holding public office that forced her to pass the torch to candidate Edmundo Gonzalez, a 74-year-old ex-diplomat known for his calm demeanor.Gonzalez has won backing even from some former supporters of the ruling party, but the opposition and observers raised questions ahead of the vote as to whether it would be fair, saying decisions by electoral authorities and the arrests of opposition staff were meant to create obstacles.Maduro – whose 2018 reelection is considered fraudulent by the United States, among others - has said Venezuela has the world’s most transparent electoral system and has warned of a “bloodbath” if he loses.Attorney General Tarek Saab told Reuters on Sunday evening that he did not anticipate any violence and that except for some isolated incidents voting had been peaceful.He expected results on Sunday night, he added.Less than a block from Saab’s office in central Caracas, dozens of ruling party supporters arrived together on motorcycles outside Andres Bello secondary school, the country’s largest voting center, scuffling with opposition supporters gathered outside.The crowd dispersed after about 20 minutes.The Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict said on X that armed groups of the motorcycle-riding ruling party supporters known as ‘collectives’ were reported in six states and Caracas.Earlier, Marlyn Hernandez, the head of voting at the school, told Reuters about 50% of the 11,493 people registered at that polling place had voted as of 5:20pm.The figure was in line with estimates released by the opposition campaign that just under 55% of people had voted nationwide.Government officials cheered the voting in evening comments on state television.“Love won,” said Jorge Rodriguez, a ruling party lawmaker and the head of Maduro’s campaign.In their own evening remarks, Gonzalez and Machado repeated a call for opposition witnesses to remain at polling places for the vote count and not leave until they had their copy of the results.The opposition official meant to observe the overall national count at the electoral authority, Delsa Solorzano, had not been allowed to enter the facility, though other opposition witnesses had, the opposition said.A legal restriction bars publication of polling from a week before the election until official results are announced, although several exit polls began circulating on social media in the late afternoon.Reuters journalists in seven locations around the country had reported morning lines outside polling stations, including some that opened late or where voting was moving slowly. Many voters had arrived before dawn.“I work cleaning houses and my four grandchildren depend on me. I earn just $15 per week and that is enough to eat one day but not the next,” said Luisa Gonzalez, 61, who voted in the state of Bolivar, traditionally a ruling party bastion.“We have spent years looking for change. I was a Chavista, but people have changed,” she said, using the term for ruling party supporters, a reference to the late President Hugo Chavez.Maduro’s government has presided over an economic collapse, the migration of about a third of the population, and a sharp deterioration in diplomatic relations, crowned by sanctions imposed by the United States, the European Union and others which have crippled an already struggling oil industry.Maduro said if returned to power he would guarantee peace and economic growth, making Venezuela less dependent on oil income.Dozens of voters cast ballots at the Venezuelan consulate in the Spanish island of Tenerife, with others gathered outside waving flags and cheering. Migrants around the world reported difficulties registering and only a small percentage of the large Venezuelan diaspora was expected to be able to vote.The Chavez legacyMaduro voted early in the morning in Caracas and said the result announced by the National Electoral Council would be recognized and defended by the armed forces and the police.Maduro said he would decree a national dialogue on Monday, using a term that typically means conversations between the government and opposition, businesses, communities and others.Many Maduro supporters speak enthusiastically of his mentor Chavez, and see Maduro, in power since Chavez’s death in 2013, as a continuation of Chavez’s legacy of helping the poor.Others told Reuters they saw Maduro’s record as mixed but that they would back him.“There are things that without doubt need to improve in our country, but this government has lived through sanctions and blockades like no other. That’s why I back President Maduro and think he deserves another chance,” said Jose Lopez, 57, as he waited to vote in central Valencia.Gonzalez and Machado have promised major changes and said a fresh start may motivate migrants to return.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. ","summary":"What animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

These issues are major causes of maternal mortality and morbidity in South Asia, posing a significant challenge to women’s sexual and reproductive health as well as social well-being and economic prospects.In Nepal, nearly half of the pregnancies are unintended and 60 percent of them end up in abortion. This directly correlates with gender inequality, socio-economic status and restrictions on sexual and reproductive rights. Early and unintended pregnancies also pose a huge barrier to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3.7, which ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services, including family planning, information and education and integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes. Nepal's National Planning Commission 2020 states, \"The government of Nepal’s target for SDG 3.7.1, is that 74% of allwomen age 15–49 have a met need for family planning with modern methods by 2022 and 80% by 2030.\"Advancement of contraceptivesOver the past few decades, there have been tremendous advances in the development of new contraceptive technologies, and a wide variety of family planning methods have been introduced. According to the National Demographic Health Survey 2022 (NDHS), 57 percent of currently married women are using a method of contraception, 43 percent are using a modern technique, and 15 percent are using a traditional method. There has been a decline in the unmet need for family planning from 32 percent in 1996 to 21 percent in 2022, which is possibly due to contraceptives.While different methods of contraception have prevented unintended pregnancies, emergency contraceptives are on the rise today. Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) are safe and effective drugs, recommended to be used within 72 hours after unprotected sexual intercourse, after accidents like condom rupture or missed pills, or if women are forced against their will to prevent pregnancy. ECPs help women avoid the adverse outcomes of unwanted pregnancies and reduce the risk of induced abortion. Offering emergency contraception is a crucial service delivery intervention for reducing this unmet need for contraception. As the name itself says, emergency contraceptives are intended only for occasional and emergency use. Counselling for the use of these pills should include options for regular contraception and advice on the correct methods in cases of perceived method failure. Concerns regarding ECPsNepal first introduced emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) through a social marketing programme in 2004. Since then, its use has risen, particularly in the last decade. The serious concerns regarding the potential use of ECP as a substitute for other contraceptives are similar to those voiced in response to the increased use of abortion in Nepal. The increased availability of over-the-counter and easy accessibility of emergency contraceptives has raised concerns regarding their safe use, misuse and potential consequences. The trend of taking ECPs as an alternative method of contraception should be seriously considered, particularly among youth. The wide advertisements, banners and posters around street corners stating it is an “easy way to the difficult situation” have misled them to either abandon or consider not using the contraceptive method regularly. It provides easy options for women to avoid unwanted or unplanned births without having to face social stigmatisation.Globally, the increasing use of ECPs has been described as an epidemic in which women are reportedly “eating contraceptives like chocolates” in Kenya and “popping them like candy” in India. The condition is similar in the context of Nepal today, where the pills are taken as a substitute for regular contraceptives. It might replace the regular use of oral combined pills, which in turn can lead to menstrual irregularities because of off-and-on withdrawal bleeding. This problem not only harms women but also potentially increases sexually transmitted diseases (STI) and HIV when condom use is replaced by repeated, indiscriminate use of emergency contraceptives. It will also deprive young women and girls of reaching out to the gynaecologist for appropriate counselling services and to consider various options regarding regular contraceptives. There is no doubt that emergency contraceptives provide a woman with the opportunity to have unprotected intercourse and ensure that every pregnancy is wanted. However, repeated misuse of emergency contraceptives needs to be evaluated for a better understanding of the positive and negative impacts of ECPs, which is critical in guiding the discourse in the right direction. Existing policies lack comprehensive implementation guidelines for the distribution of emergency contraceptive pills, necessitating integration. Comprehensive sexual health programmes and education campaigns through social media, workshops, community outreach initiatives on reproductive health and family planning methods and emergency contraceptives should be conducted. Health education on ECPs should be integrated into the curriculum to bridge the knowledge gap among youths. Similarly, equipping teachers to offer detailed sex education in urban and rural schools, incorporating public education campaigns to raise awareness about ECPs and their importance as a backup method of contraception, integrating counselling services into healthcare settings, and enhancing the competencies of paramedics, community leaders and female community health volunteers to provide basic adolescent services are urgently needed. The media, programme implementors, service providers, decision-makers and policymakers should have the right and accurate information on ECPs. There is an urgent need to disseminate information regarding family planning, pregnancy risks and contraceptive use to dispel myths and ensure the proper use of ECPs. An integrated approach is required to address the interrelated factors and create an enabling environment in which adolescents are fully aware, informed and equipped to properly utilise contraceptives and related services. As Jeff Sheffield, chairman of FIGO’s Contraception and Family Planning Committee, said, “Globally, young people, especially adolescents, do not have access to reliable, up-to-date information related to sexual and reproductive health, including contraception. This information can help inform their decisions and potentially save lives.” Let’s ponder this issue seriously.  ","summary":"Unintended pregnancy, teenage pregnancy and induced abortive procedures with complications are some common reproductive health problems affecting millions of females worldwide.

The half-mast national flag does his task of hanging his head in shame.A European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) delegation that conducted an on-site assessment of Nepal’s air safety last September pointed out several safety concerns, clearly mentioning a couple of airline carriers and CAAN as the offending parties. An assessment report submitted to CAAN’s Adhikari raised concerns about discrepancies in the work of the Flight Operations Division and the Airworthiness Inspection Division. It noted significant gaps in overseeing fatigue related to duty period regulations and ensuring comprehensive compliance checks. The report also suggested improvement in CAAN’s oversight capabilities, personnel management, staff training and certification processes.How the CAAN has responded to the European Commission’s concerns about Nepal’s air safety over the years is there for all to see: More crashes and more killings. The commission’s request to bifurcate the civil aviation body into regulatory and service-providing institutions has fallen on deaf ears.

Their concern is often about democracy being in some kind of danger, although it is mostly a case of false flagging. But there is one kind of democracy they rarely talk about—the intra-party sort. Practising internal democracy seems much more difficult than seeking it elsewhere. A couple of party conventions in the past few months have highlighted the lack of internal democracy among Nepali political parties. The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal), which concluded its three-day ‘unity general convention’ on June 12, elected Upendra Yadav as chairperson. Although the party announced its central committee members and central executive committee members after a month of the convention, it has failed to pick office bearers. Likewise, the CPN (Unified Socialist), which completed its six-day ‘national convention’ on July 5, elected Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhala Nath Khanal, and Ghanashyam Bhusal as chairman, senior leader, and general secretary, respectively, through consensus among the party’s top leaders. However, the party has yet to name its 206 central committee members and 18 office bearers.Once Yadav of the JSP-Nepal was elected to the chair unopposed, he halted the process to elect the office-bearers and central committee members, scheduled for June 13. Twenty-three candidates—17 men and six women—had filed their candidacies for the five positions of vice chairpersons, and six were vying for two posts of general secretary. Twelve aspirants—nine men and three women—had filed their candidacies for the three posts of deputy general secretary. Similarly, the Unified Socialist has yet to appoint 206 of 299 central committee members and 18 of 21 committee members in addition to finalising standing committee and politburo members. Party insiders say the top brass was busy scrutinising the backgrounds of the aspirants before making a final selection. But scrutinising may mean picking ‘yes’ men and women, especially considering the volatile nature of these parties which are either splinters from a big party or have seen their colleagues break away to form other parties.Apart from these rather fringe parties in Parliament, those that are more mainstream also struggle with the question of internal democracy. The Rastriya Swatantra Party’s joint meeting of central committee and parliamentary party set the tone for the party’s cult culture, with Rabi Lamichhane picking officer bearers considered close to him. There have also been controversies regarding an alleged manipulation of the proportional representation list to include near and dear ones of the party top brass.The situation in the top three parties—Nepali Congress, CPN (UML) and Maoist Centre—is no better. The Congress reflects a perennial vertical division of the Deuba and Koirala camps; the UML is increasingly being consolidated around the “father” figure of KP Sharma Oli, and the Maoists remain as enamoured as ever by the authoritative personality of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. With individual preferences rather than democratic values ruling the roost, the parties sustain on a feudal system offering handouts, or “tika” in the local parlance, to the sycophants while pushing away those who work hard and question the top brass. If there is one sphere that has seen a thriving “Afno Manchhe” culture—which anthropologist Dor Bahadur Bista so eloquently critiqued in his book Fatalism and Development—it is the political parties of Nepal today.  ","summary":"Nepali political parties of the Left, Right and Centre never tire of speaking about democracy.

Likewise, the CPN (Unified Socialist), which completed its six-day ‘national convention’ on July 5, elected Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhala Nath Khanal, and Ghanashyam Bhusal as chairman, senior leader, and general secretary, respectively, through consensus among the party’s top leaders. However, the party has yet to name its 206 central committee members and 18 office bearers.Once Yadav of the JSP-Nepal was elected to the chair unopposed, he halted the process to elect the office-bearers and central committee members, scheduled for June 13. Twenty-three candidates—17 men and six women—had filed their candidacies for the five positions of vice chairpersons, and six were vying for two posts of general secretary. Twelve aspirants—nine men and three women—had filed their candidacies for the three posts of deputy general secretary. Similarly, the Unified Socialist has yet to appoint 206 of 299 central committee members and 18 of 21 committee members in addition to finalising standing committee and politburo members. Party insiders say the top brass was busy scrutinising the backgrounds of the aspirants before making a final selection. But scrutinising may mean picking ‘yes’ men and women, especially considering the volatile nature of these parties which are either splinters from a big party or have seen their colleagues break away to form other parties.Apart from these rather fringe parties in Parliament, those that are more mainstream also struggle with the question of internal democracy. The Rastriya Swatantra Party’s joint meeting of central committee and parliamentary party set the tone for the party’s cult culture, with Rabi Lamichhane picking officer bearers considered close to him. There have also been controversies regarding an alleged manipulation of the proportional representation list to include near and dear ones of the party top brass.The situation in the top three parties—Nepali Congress, CPN (UML) and Maoist Centre—is no better. The Congress reflects a perennial vertical division of the Deuba and Koirala camps; the UML is increasingly being consolidated around the “father” figure of KP Sharma Oli, and the Maoists remain as enamoured as ever by the authoritative personality of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. With individual preferences rather than democratic values ruling the roost, the parties sustain on a feudal system offering handouts, or “tika” in the local parlance, to the sycophants while pushing away those who work hard and question the top brass. If there is one sphere that has seen a thriving “Afno Manchhe” culture—which anthropologist Dor Bahadur Bista so eloquently critiqued in his book Fatalism and Development—it is the political parties of Nepal today.  "},{"hash":"820f9315a73168c301cf208aa70c3ce98f3d30a7c5320364e62ab35ada4dcdb6","title":"crush-it-again","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/07/23/crush-it-again","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/thumb15-1721744192.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1721692800000,"source":"kp","category":"editorial","content":"Nepal, a country that was long in the clutches of poliovirus, made a significant stride when in 2014 the United Nations declared it “polio-free”. However, the recent detection of type-3 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV)—active viruses in the oral polio vaccine—in Kathmandu’s sewage samples collected from the confluence of the Tukucha and Bagmati Rivers indicates a potential outbreak. Although no one has been infected, the presence of the virus in sewage is in itself concerning. This calls for a prompt response from the authorities, as it could put Nepal’s achievements on polio at risk. According to the World Health Organisation, polio or poliomyelitis mainly affects children under five (but anyone unvaccinated is at risk). It is a water-borne disease and is transmitted through unhygienic habits, droplets or aerosols, faecal contamination, infected utensils, food and water. Infection from the virus has declined (by 99 percent) worldwide since 1988, but the WHO warns that “as long as a single child remains infected, children in all countries are at risk”. South Asian countries Pakistan and Afghanistan have also reported wild polio in wastewater in recent months. This means the risk of contagion in Nepal is far from over, and we can no longer be complacent. The emergence of VDPVs, as per the WHO and studies, is associated with low immunisation coverage. Vaccination is thus crucial to contain the spread of polio. Nepal has undertaken many vaccine campaigns against it. Still, as per the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, at least 4 percent of children aged 12-23 months have not been jabbed against any disease. The vaccine coverage rate for polio, according to the Health Ministry, is 95 throughout the country. So, the virus could strike under-vaccinated and unvaccinated children at any time. For successful eradication of the poliovirus back in 2014, the country’s efforts included routine vaccine campaigns, door-to-door calls, additional national and subnational mass vaccination campaigns, surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis, mop-up campaigns, and the introduction of injected vaccines in addition to oral vaccines. It’s time the government and healthcare authorities dusted off their old knowledge and kits. However, studies show that vaccines alone don’t help. A recent article, “Polio in Gaza: What Does This Mean For the Region and the World?” in The Conversation highlights how maintaining sanitation and hygiene can help eradicate polio.Health authorities and donor agencies have arranged special vaccination drives in Lalitpur, Kathmandu and Bhaktapur and are launching the campaign from today, and it will continue till July 27. They must ensure that not a single child is deprived or missed and also focus on virus surveillance in other districts and start jabbing children wherever necessary. Despite this initiative, a recent Post report highlights a significant disparity in the country’s approach to sample collection: They are taken from five tributary rivers in the Kathmandu Valley, Koshi, Madhesh and Gandaki provinces; other provinces are excluded. This isn’t comprehensive enough as poliovirus could be detected anywhere, given the constant flow of people, in and out of the country.The situation demands that the government develop country-wide monitoring, vaccination campaigns and sanitation programmes without further ado. If these measures are not prioritised, it could be a matter of time before we have another polio wave on our hands.   ","summary":"Nepal, a country that was long in the clutches of poliovirus, made a significant stride when in 2014 the United Nations declared it “polio-free”.

The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource.

Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource.

Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy.

As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  ","summary":"The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli. As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid.

They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith.

The National Examination Board had enforced the ‘non-graded’ category from this year. The underperformance of the majority of school students has stirred a fresh debate about the test system. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former National Planning Commission member Usha Jha, who led the committee that recommended the government to adopt the letter grading system.How do you analyse the SEE results published on Thursday?People have reacted to it with shock, not me. In fact, on the basis of the teaching system that is being practised in our schools, I think the results are good. We get the results based on what and how we teach students. Over 52 percent of students have been categorised as non-graded. We need to identify and address the causes behind the bad results. I have heard some people blame the letter grading system. This is wrong. A form of letter grading system was already there. We only suggested an upgraded form of the system. If we start blaming the system, we won’t find the real cause of the problem. What may be the real causes that you are hinting at?The first is the poor quality of teachers in our country. A form of letter grading system was there even before. But it had two loopholes. First, the government took an approach whereby all students would pass. That gave an impression to the students that they don’t need to study hard. That degraded the quality of their education. Second, there was a system of giving marks based on the students’ performances in theoretical and practical exams. Of the total 100 marks, the practical exams made up 35 marks. Most students were given maximum marks in the practical exams. That helped them get higher grades even if they didn’t do well in theoretical exams. This system encouraged students to neglect theoretical studies. That has caused huge damage to our education system. The letter grade system introduced this year has closed those loopholes. But the letter grading system requires a learning environment. The system was introduced without adequate preparation for its effective implementation. Also, the Covid pandemic disturbed preparatory works at the time. We should have drastically improved classroom teaching practices, and trained teachers across the country because their teaching methods are outdated. They weren’t trained on the grading system. They give lectures and encourage students to memorise while the letter grading system requires a thorough process and encourages result-oriented learning. It doesn’t prioritise marks. Our teachers and schools lacked the capacity to implement the new system. Teachers weren’t trained and prepared. Even now, most teachers don’t know what the letter grading system is. The system is necessary to make our students compete in global markets.While we upgraded the system, we didn’t upgrade the schools and teachers. Our teachers engage only in routine and formal responsibilities such as completing textbook courses before the examinations. This system should be properly internalised not only by teachers and students but also school management, palikas [local units] and parents of the students. Only then can it be effectively implemented. These are the major reasons behind the poor results. How is the students’ performance evaluated in the letter grading system?First, teachers should study a lot. They take reference of the subject matter from the textbook and teach students giving a broader perspective of the matter. They have to engage the students practically on the issue. The students should be regularly evaluated based on their participation and response in study and activities. The teachers should teach them and constantly monitor whether they are learning and making progress. The marking should be based on that. So, in this system, the examination starts from day 1 and everyday activities contribute to their marks. It also takes other activities such as behaviour, understanding, presentation into consideration. Therefore, it is called a regular assessment system based on a thorough process, unlike the traditional three-hour-long yearly examination method. If the teachers aren’t competent to carry out these activities, this idea can’t yield good results. They badly need capacity enhancement. The pedagogy should be remodelled.What was the rationale behind the decision to implement this system?One reason was to upgrade our education’s standard on par with the international standards and make our students fit for global markets. In the course of formulating this policy, we undertook a comprehensive research of international practices. Based on that evidence-based research, we submitted a report to then education minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. The government studied and endorsed it. Basically, this system was introduced with an objective of upgrading our education system in the changed context. But we lacked preparations to implement this idea.We will make a mistake if we change this system. I heard that the education minister [Sumana Shrestha] decided to make some changes in the policy and allow all non-graded students to sit for chance examinations, whereas the system says only those students who secured non-grades in two subjects can retake exams for the same subjects. There is no point in changing the method to favour even the students who have failed in all the subjects. She should have made it clear what factors made her change the criteria overnight. I cannot understand why the minister made the decision in a haste without considering its impact.In fact, our next step should have been capacity enhancement of teachers. The minister took some right decisions such as separating teachers from political parties. But an incumbent minister changing a system that was implemented by a previous minister would cause a problem. She could have formed a panel to conduct a study to find if the letter grading system is the main cause behind the students’ underperformance. But changing a policy through an order didn’t look good.Results show our students are very poor in mathematics, science and English. What could be the reasons?This is unfortunate. We saw similar trends in previous years as well. Mathematics and science are becoming more challenging. One reason is the lack of sufficient teachers for these subjects. Also, some teachers are under-utilised. Some teachers don’t go to the schools. So special measures need to be taken to manage teachers mainly for these subjects. Otherwise, we will have similar results in the coming years.The committee under your leadership recommended that those getting a GPA below 1.6 have to choose technical courses and those willing to study Grade 11 must score above 1.6 GPA. What was the idea behind that recommendation?The idea was to end the situation of halting students’ study and activities because of their lower grades. We have a government body in the form of the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) which has been offering dozens of vocational training based on the needs and interests of people. So our youths can join a suitable CTEVT course. We need more people in vocational fields. Skilled people aren’t available in the country. A large number of people working in technical fields in Nepal are from India. We included the provision in consultation with CTEVT officials. Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel had also prepared a broad plan to implement the letter grading system and integrate the vocational part in our education system. The present government should improve the education system by enhancing teachers’ capacity and encouraging youths to join vocational training to fill the gaps in the employment market. Are the infrastructure and resources available in our education system sufficient to implement the grading system?Some schools lack even essential resources while in some we find misuse or underuse of resources. So, our education ministry should carry out a comprehensive mapping and find where teachers are required, where they are underutilised and where they are idle. Then, the government can make optimum use of the teachers and make additional investment on need-basis. Such an approach will yield better results. In general, our academic institutions lack resources as there is a trend of allocating insufficient budgets for the education sector. Yes, the letter grading system needs more investment. We have to work on teachers’ capacity enhancement and to provide learning materials to students. When you make an activity participatory, you certainly need resources and investments.Do we need to review our teacher recruitment process and our pedagogy in the universities that produce teachers?The government can consider new requirements while recruiting teachers and train them accordingly. Also, we need to update our curriculum and pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. I have doubts about the quality of our graduates, post-graduates and even PhD holders due to the poor teaching and learning environment of our academic institutions. There is a need for more coordination and collaboration between the government and universities to address such issues.In the end, I want to stress that the government should adopt a clear and consistent policy and avoid ad-hoc decisions. The letter grading system is the best and we should push for that despite the challenges in its implementation. Just that it should have been enforced after enhancing teachers’ capacity. The problems we have now are due to lack of preparation. ","summary":"In the Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) conducted this year, over 52 percent of students failed to graduate to grade 11.

So our youths can join a suitable CTEVT course. We need more people in vocational fields. Skilled people aren’t available in the country. A large number of people working in technical fields in Nepal are from India. We included the provision in consultation with CTEVT officials. Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel had also prepared a broad plan to implement the letter grading system and integrate the vocational part in our education system. The present government should improve the education system by enhancing teachers’ capacity and encouraging youths to join vocational training to fill the gaps in the employment market. Are the infrastructure and resources available in our education system sufficient to implement the grading system?Some schools lack even essential resources while in some we find misuse or underuse of resources. So, our education ministry should carry out a comprehensive mapping and find where teachers are required, where they are underutilised and where they are idle. Then, the government can make optimum use of the teachers and make additional investment on need-basis. Such an approach will yield better results. In general, our academic institutions lack resources as there is a trend of allocating insufficient budgets for the education sector. Yes, the letter grading system needs more investment. We have to work on teachers’ capacity enhancement and to provide learning materials to students. When you make an activity participatory, you certainly need resources and investments.Do we need to review our teacher recruitment process and our pedagogy in the universities that produce teachers?The government can consider new requirements while recruiting teachers and train them accordingly. Also, we need to update our curriculum and pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. I have doubts about the quality of our graduates, post-graduates and even PhD holders due to the poor teaching and learning environment of our academic institutions. There is a need for more coordination and collaboration between the government and universities to address such issues.In the end, I want to stress that the government should adopt a clear and consistent policy and avoid ad-hoc decisions. The letter grading system is the best and we should push for that despite the challenges in its implementation. Just that it should have been enforced after enhancing teachers’ capacity. The problems we have now are due to lack of preparation.
