The two nations that do not share borders are mobilizing high-end weaponry to attack each other and kill human lives.1 April 2024, the Israeli military attacked the Iranian consulate in Syria. A strike against a non-military facility in a third nation, a nation not directly involved in the conflict, infringes international law and constitutes a war crime. Moreover, on 13 April, Iran responded by attacking Israel‚Äôs land. Both nations have pointed their guns directly at each other, and there are growing concerns in the international community that the attacks could escalate into another war.\nThe Israel-Hamas War in Gaza has killed 30,000 since last year, and news outlets reported on dire situations in Gaza, running out of space for proper burial. The war that has persisted in the region over the past century continuously overshadows the prospect of the coexistence of the human race.\nIt is a clear indication that the greatest victims of war are innocent civilians. How could those lost lives ever be brought back? What could compensate for the outcry of children and the anguish of the youth in devastated dwellings?\nHWPL strongly supports the voices of the citizens, the true protagonists of the global village, who oppose war and call for peace. All nations of the global community must uphold the citizens‚Äô demands, thereby ceasing the unjust war and joining to accomplish peace. Organizations worldwide, in alliance with HWPL as peace solidarity, urge Iran and Israel to put a stop to the acts of aggression immediately and to come forward for conversations to usher in peace.\nHWPL recommend that the international community take necessary measures to facilitate the formation of amicable relations between the two nations and provide humanitarian aid. It would be reasonable for all countries to support an international legal instrument for peace that embodies the long-yearned path to peace and to comply with its contents so that we leave a legacy of peace for future generations. HWPL will not spare its efforts for peace and cessation of wars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"hash":"c94f8e4afac88e1cb0fb370ada56857a008186039807d76728b22d93ca250d67","title":"Nepal and Korea are preparing for a high-level visit to strengthen ties and cooperation between their countries.","date":1715126400000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/global/preparation-of-high-level-visit-between-nepal-and-korea","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/korea1715163613_1024.jpg","category":"global","content":"Nepal and South Korea will celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations.\n\n**High-level officials will visit Nepal for the anniversary.**\n\nThe two countries have been close partners, especially in investment and employment:\n\n* South Korea is the 4th largest investor in Nepal.\n* Hyundai's assembly plant will open in Nepal soon.\n* Over 44,000 Nepalis currently work in South Korea, mostly in agriculture and production.\n* Nepalis will now also work in service and forestry sectors in Korea.\n* Nepalis who return from South Korea often start businesses, creating jobs in Nepal.","summary":"Nepal and South Korea prepare for high-level exchange, mark 50th diplomatic anniversary with events, increased investment, and expanded job opportunities for Nepalis in Korea."},{"hash":"e723ab3067a8adddaf32c9827d2897f76acc62350800bee739d3b29786c034f6","title":"Japan and Nepal have similarities and a strong relationship, as stated by Japan's Foreign Minister Kamikawa Yoko.","date":1714867200000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/global/japan-and-nepal-share-many-things-in-common-japan-s-foreign-minister-kamikawa-yoko","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/japan_foregn_minister1714872450_1024.jpg","category":"global","content":"**Similarities between Japan and Nepal:**\n\n* Mountainous terrain\n* Democratic governments\n\n**Assistance from Japan to Nepal:**\n\n* Support for democratization\n* Support for legal system development\n* Aid after earthquakes (e.g., blankets, rescue teams, funding for reconstruction)\n* Infrastructure construction (e.g., roads, tunnels)\n* Support for agriculture, education, healthcare\n\n**Growing ties between Japan and Nepal:**\n\n* Direct flights between the two countries\n* Over 170,000 Nepalis living in Japan\n* Cooperation in \"Women, Peace and Security\"\n\n**Japan's commitment to supporting Nepal's development**\n\n* Assistance in a wide range of fields\n* Focus on building resilience and stability\n* Support for Nepal's graduation from Least Developed Country category","summary":"Japan and Nepal, both mountainous countries with democratic histories, have faced earthquakes and supported each other, with Japan providing assistance in infrastructure, development, and \"Women, Peace and Security.\""},{"hash":"92ad5a4c56c6702ac1fca8e9aea40059b95bd75ed4ab056b7e61b7be50879246","title":"not-to-go-to-foreign-employment-through-illegal-route-embassy","date":1715431496377,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/global/not-to-go-to-foreign-employment-through-illegal-route-embassy","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/embassy_of_nepal1714535848_1024.jpg","category":"global","content":"Nepali Embassy in Pakistan warns against illegal foreign job offers.

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East‚Äîa close-knit settlement of 425 houses‚Äîwas considered the Maoists‚Äô ‚Äòbase area‚Äô during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. ‚ÄúYouths started going to America about six-seven years ago,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.‚Äù Budha‚Äôs own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US‚Äîa country that the Maoists used to call their ‚Äòenemy‚Äô, an ‚Äòimperialistic force‚Äô. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors‚Äô pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. ‚ÄúAfter the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn‚Äôt live in the village peacefully,‚Äù said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, ‚ÄúWhen will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!‚ÄùDhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. ‚ÄúNow we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal‚Äôs trip abroad],‚Äù Nanda Kala said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no point staying here.‚ÄùStories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.‚ÄùFor six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. ‚ÄúWhen I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,‚Äù he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak‚Äôs wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt know what exactly happened,‚Äù said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak‚Äôs trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, ‚ÄúI only have memories.‚ÄùLack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‚ÄòWorkers of the world, unite!‚Äô, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there‚Äôs nothing he can do. ‚ÄúHow could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?‚Äù he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn‚Äôt herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. ‚ÄúMeter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,‚Äù he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang‚Äôs Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. ‚ÄúOnly those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,‚Äù he said.One can infer from Pandey‚Äôs statements that the families of such illegal travellers don‚Äôt want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn‚Äôt include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‚Äòbase areas‚Äô of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. ‚ÄúThis is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,‚Äù Shrestha said. ‚ÄúThe Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.‚Äù Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency‚Äôs ‚Äòbase areas‚Äô is due to the political system‚Äôs abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. ‚ÄúThe traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDevelopments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.‚Äù(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.
