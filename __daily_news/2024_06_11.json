The Pancheshwar project was planned nearly three decades ago on the Mahakali river on the Nepal-India border to generate electricity, facilitate irrigation, and control floods. Despite its huge prospects, the project has failed to make progress as Nepal and India have failed to resolve contentious issues like sharing of the project’s costs and benefits. Speaking to the press upon landing in Kathmandu, Prime Minister Dahal reiterated the claims he made with the journalists at the Embassy of Nepal in New Delhi.Dahal had paid a courtesy call on Indian President Droupadi Murmu at the President’s office on Monday. They discussed matters of bilateral interest, the Embassy of Nepal wrote on social media.During the meeting with Prime Minister Dahal, Indian President Murmu emphasised India’s priority for Nepal, reads the press statement released by the Indian President’s secretariat. “Nepal is a priority partner under India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, and [President Murmu] conveyed India’s commitment to further strengthen unique ties.” Prime Minister Dahal’s secretariat said the meeting delved into topics of utmost importance, including centuries-old Nepal-India relations and strengthening people-to-people connections. On Monday, newly appointed Indian Union Minister S Jaishankar paid a courtesy call on Prime Minister Dahal at the Taj Hotel, where the prime minister was staying. During the meeting, they discussed bilateral relations and the implementation aspect of the agreements reached between the two countries. Jaishankar was the External Affairs Minister in the immediate past Cabinet of the Modi government. He retained the same ministry later on Monday.Minister Jaishankar assured that the Indian government was diligently working to expedite the agreements made in the past and that satisfactory progress had been made, according to a member of the Nepali delegation. The Indian minister also reaffirmed the commitment to strengthen relations. In the meeting, Prime Minister Dahal extended his congratulations to Jaishankar and also expressed his optimism about the future of bilateral ties and people-to-people relations between Nepal and India during Jaishankar’s new tenure as the minister. A Nepali delegate who was present in the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Jaishankar described the meeting as a semi-formal one, but the two leaders discussed important issues. “During the meeting both sides discussed matters relating to bilateral issues,” said a Nepali delegate member on the condition of anonymity. “India is keen to expedite some projects, which we could sense while participating in the meeting.”Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured 240 seats in the 14th Lok Sabha election. Despite BJP falling 32 seats short of securing a majority of its own in the 543-strong assembly, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) that he led commanded the majority, paving the way for Modi’s historic third term as prime minister. Modi has now become the second Indian leader to serve as prime minister for the third consecutive term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of independent India.During the meeting with the Indian minister Jaishankar, Prime Minister Dahal was accompanied by his daughter Ganga Dahal, Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri, Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal, and other officials from the Nepali Embassy in India. Prime Minister Dahal on Monday also met with the delegation of the Federation of India Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). During the interaction both sides discussed the possibilities of investment in Nepal, said the Prime Minister Dahal’s secretariat.During the meeting, Dahal urged Indian investors to launch ventures in Nepal. “Nepal has created an investment-friendly environment through comprehensive legal reforms,” Dahal’s secretariat quoted him as saying at the meeting with the Indian business community. “We urged Indian investors to explore opportunities in tourism, energy, agriculture, and other sectors.”FICCI President Anish Shah said that he and his members are interested in investing in Nepal’s energy and tourism sectors.  ","summary":"Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that he has urged his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi to resolve contentious issues through the bilateral mechanisms between the two countries.Prime Minister Dahal, who travelled to New Delhi on Sunday to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the Indian prime minister, met him at Rashtrapati Bhawan after the ceremony.“During my meeting with Indian Prime Minister Modi after the oath-taking ceremony [Sunday evening]...I called for implementing the agreements signed between the two governments during my official visit to India last June,” Dahal said while interacting with Nepali journalists at the Nepali Embassy in Delhi before flying back to Kathmandu. “I spoke to the prime minister and the federal minister [S Jaishankar] about the need to resolve disputes by activating the border mechanism as well as the South Asian Association Regional Cooperation,” Prime Minister Dahal said. “I am hopeful that discussions on these matters will proceed through the existing mechanisms.” Prime Minister Dahal appeared optimistic that the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project will also move ahead.

Despite BJP falling 32 seats short of securing a majority of its own in the 543-strong assembly, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) that he led commanded the majority, paving the way for Modi’s historic third term as prime minister. Modi has now become the second Indian leader to serve as prime minister for the third consecutive term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of independent India.During the meeting with the Indian minister Jaishankar, Prime Minister Dahal was accompanied by his daughter Ganga Dahal, Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri, Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal, and other officials from the Nepali Embassy in India. Prime Minister Dahal on Monday also met with the delegation of the Federation of India Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). During the interaction both sides discussed the possibilities of investment in Nepal, said the Prime Minister Dahal’s secretariat.During the meeting, Dahal urged Indian investors to launch ventures in Nepal. “Nepal has created an investment-friendly environment through comprehensive legal reforms,” Dahal’s secretariat quoted him as saying at the meeting with the Indian business community. “We urged Indian investors to explore opportunities in tourism, energy, agriculture, and other sectors.”FICCI President Anish Shah said that he and his members are interested in investing in Nepal’s energy and tourism sectors.  "},{"hash":"57d424362ca6a937206b62c337c519cccdc92d74de08bf083c5c050f48ded9d6","title":"modi-3-0-won-t-bring-much-change-in-india-s-nepal-policy-ex-envoy-saran","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/06/11/modi-3-0-won-t-bring-much-change-in-india-s-nepal-policy-ex-envoy-saran","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/RSSIMG20240610WA0000-1718068269.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1718064000000,"source":"kp","category":"national","content":"Former Indian foreign secretary and ambassador to Nepal Shyam Saran has said that India’s Nepal policy is unlikely to change during the third term of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Saran, who was in Kathmandu to attend a regional conference organised by ICIMOD, is one of the key architects of India’s Nepal policy after the political changes of 2005–2006 in Kathmandu.Speaking at an interaction organised by Centre for Social Innovation and Foreign Policy (CSIF), a private research centre, on Monday, the veteran Indian diplomat also reviewed the India’s policy towards Nepal in the past decade; impacts and constraints of India’s ‘Neighborhood First’ policy; and what India can do in the future to overcome those constraints among others issues like climate change, economy, trade and transit.“There will be more continuity than departure in India’s foreign policy in coming days—in rhetoric or style,” he said. “The regional parties in the new Modi government are overwhelmed with domestic issues and they do not have a stated foreign policy position that can bring about a change.”On India's Nepal policy, he said that India is comfortable with Nepal as long as Nepal is satisfied.Saran, who is considered close with the previous Congress I establishment of India, stated that some of the cross-border connectivity projects between Nepal and India were conceived during the government of Congress I, which also ruled India for a decade.“Be it railways, roads or integrated check posts and others—these cross-border connectivity projects were launched and conceived during the previous establishment,” Saran said. “Congress I and its allies ruled India for almost a decade until 2014, when Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party won the elections.”Saran said that Modi did “in-person” diplomacy. Saran did not criticise Modi’s foreign policy but was cautious with his views. “He [Modi] tried to make a big change in the foreign policy but he did not succeed that much,” he said.Speaking about India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, Saran said that neighbouring countries occupy a special role in shaping India’s foreign policy. Countries in the region can work together in areas like geopolitics, geoeconomics and geoecology, among others, he said.Saran also detailed the evolution of the ‘Neighborhood First’ policy, some of its prominent features and its attendant risks if the true spirit of the policy, which came to limelight after 2014, remains unfulfilled.“India is a huge country, it looks after its own interests and does not interfere with neighboring countries’ affairs that much,” said Saran, who was the ambassador of India to Nepal when the latter was going through momentous political changes in 2005-06.Moreover, Saran advised the Indian establishment to open up the Indian market for the rest of the South Asian nations in terms of trade, commerce and various kinds of transit facilities. “In terms of trade and business, South Asia is less integrated and South Asian countries are doing merely five percent intra-regional trade,” he said. “It does not mean that South Asian nations should depend on India but they must come together and cooperate with India on issues like trade, commerce and transit facilities.”Saran added, “When I was ambassador in Kathmandu 20 years ago, we did not imagine cooperation in the field of energy and power but now it is possible.” Saran cited the BBIN, the sub-regional framework between Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal, as an example of intra-regional cooperation.“The main thing is, we have to change the mindset,” said Saran. “India and other South Asian nations should come together for common progress and prosperity.”On China, he said that Chinese influence in Kathmandu was much higher in the 1960s than it is now. Saran added that the open border between Nepal and India should remain so and there is no need to change its status which is unique in the world.“India is the partner of choice and Nepal is free to choose its partner,” said the former Indian foreign secretary who also held several important portfolios after he retired from the Indian foreign service.“One important thing is, we know Nepal little and Nepalis also do not understand India that much,” Saran said. “Both sides should invest more to understand each other.”On Monday’s event, various diplomats, professors, retired generals, members of think-tanks and journalists held an interaction with Saran on various topical issues regarding India’s foreign and regional policy.

Although the draft reached the Ministry of Law and then to the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. However, the process has been delayed due to frequent changes in the government.Last year, the Industry Ministry cancelled the previous process and started a fresh process by forming a committee.The committee recommended setting up a pilot consumer court in an appropriate location within the Valley, in coordination with or on the advice of the Judicial Council, considering the current condition of the country and available resources, the official said.

In September 2019, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies submitted draft legislation to establish a consumer court to the Ministry of Law, which then forwarded it to the Judicial Council. As the process was delayed, the Supreme Court on February 20, 2022 ordered the government to establish consumer courts in all provinces to protect buyers' interests amid repeated cases of unfair market practices.A division bench of justices Bam Kumar Shrestha and Nahakul Subedi issued the order after the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights Nepal moved the court. But there isn’t any indication yet of such a court being established in any of the country's seven provinces.The Industry Ministry official said they realised that setting up one consumer court per province would not be practical as people will have to travel long distances for their cases, so the draft has proposed setting up consumer courts in each district gradually. A consumer court is a specialised court which primarily deals with consumer-related disputes, conflicts, and grievances. The court holds hearings to adjudicate these issues.The public has long been demanding a consumer court to bring unscrupulous traders under a legal framework within a fast-track system.Since consumers do not want to get involved in complex court cases, particularly at the Supreme Court, this has emboldened unscrupulous traders, observers say. They believe that once consumer courts are established, filing complaints will become easier and there will be fewer hassles.Consumer rights activists said that they are hopeful that the government will follow through on its announcement made in the annual budget and set up consumer courts. “With the policies and programmes for upcoming fiscal year 2024-25 mentioning the formation of consumer courts and the government allocating budget for it, we are hopeful that the court will be established in the coming fiscal year despite the long delay,” said Bishnu Prasad Timilsina, the general secretary of the Forum for Consumers' Rights.The Law Minister and Industry Minister have also committed to establishing consumer courts, and the Supreme Court has already issued an order to this effect, therefore it is expected that this time it will be implemented, Timilsina said. “And just setting up the courts alone will not be enough, they have to be effective.”\"Consumer courts need to be digitised so that consumers who have become victims can easily file their cases through applications, ensuring quick processing, and track the proceedings through digital mediums,\" Timilsina said.      ","summary":"The government plans to establish a consumer court in the Kathmandu Valley as a pilot in the coming fiscal year 2024-25.Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun made the announcement on May 28 while unveiling the budget for the fiscal year 2024-25.

The Upendra Yadav-led party is holding the mega event at a time the party has suffered multiple setbacks. Seven of its 12 federal lawmakers split the JSP-Nepal and registered a new outfit—Janata Samajbadi Party—at the Election Commission last month. The party of Upendra Yadav, who headed the party that had continuously led Madhesh provincial government since 2018, has been pushed to the opposition bench in the provincial assembly. Yadav, who was deputy prime minister and health minister in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Cabinet until last month, has been ousted from the federal government as well. Despite such adverse circumstances, Yadav is poised to be the party chief again, most likely unopposed.Yadav rose to power after successfully spearheading a Madhesh movement in 2007 demanding rights for the historically marginalised Madheshi people. Though the demand for federalism had been raised by various quarters even in the past, it was Yadav-led agitation that eventually forced the Nepali state to introduce the federal system in the country. He formed Madheshi Janadhikar Forum-Nepal under his own leadership. Since then he has always been at the helm of a party. He has merged his party with various outfits, multiple times, only to split again.With the rise of Madheshi parties in the aftermath of the second people’s movement in 2006, people—not only from the southern belt of the country but also from most marginalised communities—had high hopes for a paradigm shift in Nepali politics. The big parties traditionally holding power, namely the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, had felt pressure. But within years of their joining governments in Kathmandu, people were disenchanted by their performance. A section of people expected that the regional parties would do better when allowed to lead provincial governments. They failed in the province as well.In Nepal, communist leaders and parties have been infamous for persistent disputes and divisions, mostly after the 1990 political change. When parties mushroomed in Madhesh, they beat the communists in terms of infightings and divisions. There is not a single party in Madhesh that remained intact, which is disappointing for those who expected that regional forces would build pressure on traditional forces through better delivery.Mismanagement, lack of organisational discipline, non-transparency and top leaders’ monopoly in decision-making have become common traits of Madhesh-based parties. Big parties such as the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre are criticised for being monopolistic and rather undemocratic. But, newer forces proved themselves worse. For instance, at least the big parties have been holding their general conventions as per the constitutional provision. Their provincial, district and village units are also elected through a process. For example, the UML is now electing its district leaders through conventions. When they fail to pick leaders in consensus, they readily go for a vote. Top leaders may favour those loyal to them but even these loyalists must nonetheless follow the process. That is why the UML is considered the most organised party in the country. The Congress also follows at least basic democratic norms while electing its leaders and making important decisions. But we don’t see the same in Madhesh-based and other newly emerged forces. This is unfortunate. Only political parties that are well-organised, democratic and transparent in their activities will have the moral strength to mount pressure on big forces. Those who can’t maintain democracy and transparency in their own organisations can’t ensure it in the government when they come to power. We hardly find any leader in Madhesh handing over party leadership to other leaders through a democratic process. We hope that in the ongoing convention Yadav’s JSP-Nepal can bring policies to make the party organisation more transparent and democratic.

A 2007 Human Rights Watch report on the “untouchables” of India observed, “The only parallel to the practice of untouchability was apartheid in South Africa.” The HRW has declared caste discrimination a form of “hidden apartheid”—an apt observation for Nepal as well.In the past years, caste hatred and exclusion have become more concealed yet pervasive in the Himalayan region; caste has also spread its tentacles in the global diaspora. Last month, Amnesty International criticised the government’s utter apathy and lack of accountability on the persistent plight of Dalits. The communist-populist alliance in government doesn’t seem to heed the call for change. This is clear from recently announced government policies, programmes and budgets for the fiscal year 2024-25. The authorities are bent on keeping caste hierarchy and untouchability sacred and solid. Budget for ‘Dalit skills’On March 21, 2022, attending a Dalit function in Kathmandu, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal declared that he was making a big announcement for the dignity and freedom of the “untouchables”. So much so that, he said, they would not forget it in over a century. He hasn’t made his supposedly phenomenal Dalit project explicit, but some Dalits still haven’t given up their hopes. Something came with this year’s budget for the Dalit community: Rs200 million to enhance Dalits’ traditional skills to create employment and promote their livelihood. This small yet seemingly significant budget has buoyed some Dalits. After all, as everybody says, something is better than nothing. However, I’m sceptical about the effectiveness of the Dalit-centred budget. Is it a big enough pot of money to significantly impact the target population? Most people would say “No”. Even some prominent Dalit NGO personalities close to the governing parties have expressed their dissatisfaction with the amount. Equally, are Dalits the only beneficiaries of this new scheme? I don't think so. The details of the intended 200-million project haven’t been developed yet. But it seems many non-Dalits will also get the support, especially those close to the ruling parties and leaders. There are at least two reasons for my understanding. First is the very name of the entity the government plans to establish to use that money: A separate body called the “Dalit, Neglected and Oppressed Class Upliftment and Development Corporation.” The use of so many words is likely intended to involve the beneficiaries from different castes and social groups. My suspicion stems from the second fact: In today’s Nepal, traditional Dalit skills—such as goldsmithing, tailoring, woodworking, and shoemaking—are no longer exclusively practised by Dalits. Once commercialised, many castes including the apex groups, have started these trades. So, skill enhancement projects will probably not be offered only to Dalits. I am not suggesting Dalits should have exclusive rights over these essential skills. It is neither practical nor proper to make such a case. My point is that it is probably wrong to think that the budget is for the betterment of Dalits. Untouched untouchabilityI have a serious objection to the utter lack of sensitivity towards the problems of Dalits, mainly the persistent practice of untouchability (hidden apartheid) in government policies, programmes and the budget. There is no single statement in the policies that mentions untouchability, let alone try to address it. The same applies to the state and local authorities under the federal system. The biggest irony is found in the Karnali Province, where the Province Head, Tilak Pariyar, is a Dalit man with a long history of fighting against the state as part of the Maoist movement, with ending caste oppression as a primary goal. On May 23, he presented 84-point policies and programmes of the province. Study it in detail, and aside from lip service here and there, there is no serious concern about the situation of Dalits in Karnali who have been facing caste humiliation and violence like nowhere else in the country. Yet the authorities seem totally blind to the realities! Recommended policy objectives What should a responsible government do, both in Kathmandu and Karnali? First, the federal capital should become sensitive towards the plight of Dalits, who suffer tremendously due to popular beliefs and practices of ritual impurity. Then, the federal capital should design a national policy framework that could be followed by the lower authorities.On a Sunday press meet, Caste Watch Network (CWN), a newly launched Dalit campaign group, recommended two fundamental policy objectives for tackling the complex problem of untouchability.First, the state should introduce new laws and policies—sticks and carrots—to enforce the constitutional and legal provisions against untouchability. It could, for example, forge a policy of immediately suspending government officials guilty of excluding and humiliating Dalits. Elderly people who discriminate against Dalits could be deprived of their elderly pensions for two years or so. Any temple practising Dalit exclusion could be deprived of state support in the form of money and sacred offerings and sacrificial animals (yes, even the historical and famous temples like Gorakhkali and Manakamana do practise a form of social exclusion). The second important policy objective would be to reform the religion. Some people frown at my suggestions about initiating religious and cultural reform, which they think takes many decades, if not centuries.While we cannot easily rewrite casteist texts like Manusmriti and Parasaramriti, it is possible to achieve the reformation of some religious beliefs and practices over time. For that, the secular state should stand firm against religious dogma and formulate proper laws and implement them. If no religious and/or cultural reform were possible at all, we would still be burning our mothers and sisters and other women alive on the sati pyres. If reform weren’t possible, we wouldn’t see a section of Bahuns drinking alcohol and consuming pork, and, as alluded to earlier, engaging in tailoring, drumming, shoemaking and goldsmithing. Upper castes have deceived Dalits. They have forced religious and cultural transformations in areas that benefit them materially and in other ways. And they have been opposed to the reform of those areas of religious and cultural traditions that would ensure equal rights for Dalits. For example, a Bahun doesn’t become polluted by drinking and drumming; these transgressions do not anger his deities. But he thinks he and his family, lineage and other deities and spirits become polluted if a drummer enters his house. Religious-cultural reform is not as tough as it seems. Governments and authorities at all levels should introduce new laws and policies and spend large sums to change the spiritual, religious and cultural spheres. Without this, we cannot do away with untouchability. ","summary":"Nepal is a de facto caste-apartheid state.

This virus was found to be linked to dairy cattle outbreaks. It is a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), and its mortality rate is estimated to be higher than 50 percent. This unusual virus transmission route, i.e., from cattle/unpasteurised raw milk to humans, triggered a grave concern among policymakers and scientists worldwide. Generally, bird flu is transmitted to humans through close contact with infected live or dead birds. It is somewhat surprising that the data (from 1997 to 2014) released by the World Health Organization (WHO) showed the H5N1 bird flu virus was widely circulated among children. However, the significance of the bird flu virus circulating in children remains unknown, sparking several questions: What is the source of the virus infections in children? Is the virus easily transmitted through senior family members to the children? Why does the H5N1 bird flu infection appear as a mild illness in children, despite its estimated mortality rate of over 50 percent? Do the antibodies generated after the H5N1 bird flu infection provide sufficient protection from future infections? Is H5N1 bird flu still widely circulating among children, particularly in areas experiencing outbreaks mainly in poultry farms?The first human H5N1 bird flu cases were first reported in Hong Kong in 1997. Symptoms include fever (often higher than 38 degrees Celsius), cough, sore throat, malaise and body ache. The disease can quickly progress to severe pneumonia and neurologic changes. However, the bird flu virus transmitted from cattle or raw milk did not show severe symptoms in humans in the United States. While two confirmed cases showed mild symptoms, such as pink eyes or conjunctivitis, the third presented with a cough without fever and eye discomfort with watery discharge. The reason behind different symptoms of the same virus in different people is not well understood at the moment. However, human bird flu cases from cattle/raw milk observed in the US underscores the need to revise the clinical case definition of influenza-like illness (ILI), the main criteria for performing laboratory tests to confirm the virus. The current case definition for ILI is fever (higher than 38 degrees Celsius) and cough with onset within the last 10 days, meaning bird flu cases with pink eyes or conjunctivitis may go unnoticed, especially among dairy farmers. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently advised workers (who work in dairy farms) to use personnel protective equipment, such as masks, gloves, boots and goggles, to minimise the risk of H5N1 bird flu infection. The virus has been found in the raw milk of dairy cows. Hence, it is also advised to consume pasteurised milk to avoid possible bird flu infection.In Nepal, dairy farm workers do not use PPE. Therefore, they are at risk of getting infected with several organisms, including the H5N1 bird flu virus, although it has not yet been reported in cattle in our country. Nevertheless, the Government of Nepal should pay attention and initiate surveillance to identify possible cattle-human bird flu transmission. We have been experiencing bird flu (H5N1) outbreaks almost every year for over 14 years. A 21-year-old male died of H5N1 bird flu in Nepal in 2019, although the source of infection, in this case, could not be determined. What is surprising is that based on WHO data (from 1997 through 2014), the H5N1 bird flu virus was seen most frequently in children below 15 years (nearly 45 percent of all confirmed cases), followed by 15-30, 31-50 and over 50 years of age groups respectively. Strikingly, the H5N1 bird flu was even more common among children under five. It shows that the H5N1 virus can readily reach the child population but is less severe and has lower death rates compared to adults. However, studies on the source of the H5N1 bird flu infection in the child population remain scarce. Safe and effective vaccines against the influenza virus are available in the global market, and people are advised to get vaccinated yearly, especially in the most vulnerable groups such as older people with underlying health problems, children, pregnant women and immunocompromised people. Regrettably, no vaccines for human use against H5N1 bird flu are available. Experts believe and even predict that H5N1 bird flu may appear as the next pandemic, which may pose unprecedented challenges to the healthcare system as did by multiple waves of Covid-19 not long ago. “Oseltamivir (Tamiflu)” is an antiviral medicine effective against H5N1 bird flu in humans. Patients infected with H5N1 bird flu from cattle/raw milk in the US were also treated with this medicine and recovered uneventfully. In fact, oseltamivir has been used worldwide for the treatment and prophylaxis of seasonal flu. Developing a safe and effective vaccine against H5N1 bird flu is necessary to combat potential “H5N1 pandemic” threats. ","summary":"Recently, at least three people were diagnosed with influenza A (H5N1), commonly known as “bird flu”, in the United States. This virus was found to be linked to dairy cattle outbreaks. It is a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), and its mortality rate is estimated to be higher than 50 percent. This unusual virus transmission route, i.e., from cattle/unpasteurised raw milk to humans, triggered a grave concern among policymakers and scientists worldwide. Generally, bird flu is transmitted to humans through close contact with infected live or dead birds. It is somewhat surprising that the data (from 1997 to 2014) released by the World Health Organization (WHO) showed the H5N1 bird flu virus was widely circulated among children. However, the significance of the bird flu virus circulating in children remains unknown, sparking several questions: What is the source of the virus infections in children? Is the virus easily transmitted through senior family members to the children? Why does the H5N1 bird flu infection appear as a mild illness in children, despite its estimated mortality rate of over 50 percent? Do the antibodies generated after the H5N1 bird flu infection provide sufficient protection from future infections? Is H5N1 bird flu still widely circulating among children, particularly in areas experiencing outbreaks mainly in poultry farms?The first human H5N1 bird flu cases were first reported in Hong Kong in 1997. Symptoms include fever (often higher than 38 degrees Celsius), cough, sore throat, malaise and body ache. The disease can quickly progress to severe pneumonia and neurologic changes. However, the bird flu virus transmitted from cattle or raw milk did not show severe symptoms in humans in the United States. While two confirmed cases showed mild symptoms, such as pink eyes or conjunctivitis, the third presented with a cough without fever and eye discomfort with watery discharge. The reason behind different symptoms of the same virus in different people is not well understood at the moment. However, human bird flu cases from cattle/raw milk observed in the US underscores the need to revise the clinical case definition of influenza-like illness (ILI), the main criteria for performing laboratory tests to confirm the virus. The current case definition for ILI is fever (higher than 38 degrees Celsius) and cough with onset within the last 10 days, meaning bird flu cases with pink eyes or conjunctivitis may go unnoticed, especially among dairy farmers. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently advised workers (who work in dairy farms) to use personnel protective equipment, such as masks, gloves, boots and goggles, to minimise the risk of H5N1 bird flu infection. The virus has been found in the raw milk of dairy cows. Hence, it is also advised to consume pasteurised milk to avoid possible bird flu infection.In Nepal, dairy farm workers do not use PPE. Therefore, they are at risk of getting infected with several organisms, including the H5N1 bird flu virus, although it has not yet been reported in cattle in our country.

It was up to Washington to ensure that Israel abides by it, he added.He said Hamas accepted the formula stipulating the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a swap of hostages held in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israel.\"The US administration is facing a real test to carry out its commitments in compelling the occupation to immediately end the war in an implementation of the UN Security Council resolution,\" Abu Zuhri told Reuters.Blinken said the Hamas statement was \"a hopeful sign\" but definitive word was still needed from the Hamas leadership inside Israeli-besieged Gaza. \"That's what counts, and that's what we don't have yet.\"The war began when Hamas-led Palestinian militants stormed into southern Israel from Gaza on Oct. 7, killing more than 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Israel's retaliatory air and ground blitz in Gaza has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians, the Gaza health ministry has said, and reduced most of the narrow, coastal enclave to wasteland, with malnutrition widespread.Biden's proposal envisages a ceasefire and release of hostages in exchange for Palestinians jailed in Israel in stages, ultimately leading to a permanent end to the war.Israel has said it will agree only to temporary pauses in the war until Hamas is defeated, while Hamas has countered it will not accept a deal that does not guarantee the war will end.Blinken, speaking to reporters before departing for neighbouring Jordan, also said his talks were also addressing day-after plans for Gaza, including security, governance, and rebuilding the densely populated enclave.\"We've been doing that in consultation with many partners throughout the region. Those conversations will continue...it's imperative that we have these plans,\" he said.In the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, Palestinians reacted cautiously to the Security Council vote, fearing it could prove yet another ceasefire initiative that would prove fruitless.\"We will believe it only when we see it,\" said Shaban Abdel-Raouf, 47, a displaced family of five sheltering in the central city of Deir Al-Balah, a frequent target of Israeli firepower.\"When they tell us to pack our belongings and prepare to go back to Gaza City, we will know it is true,\" he told Reuters via a chat app.FEARS OF MAJOR ISRAEL-HEZBOLLAH WARIn his visit, his eighth to the Middle East since the Israel-Hamas war erupted last October, Blinken also hoped to counter rising violence between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah after both signalled readiness for a major spillover conflict.On Monday, Blinken had talks in Cairo with President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of Egypt, an important mediator in the Gaza war, in Cairo before proceeding to Israel, where he met with Primem Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant.Blinken had consultations on Tuesday with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, centrist ex-military chief Benny Gantz - who quit Israel's war cabinet on Sunday over what he said was Netanyahu's failure to outline a plan for the war's end - as well as opposition leader Yair Lapid.The U.S. State Department said Blinken discussed Biden's truce proposal with Gantz and reiterated that it would advance Israel's security interests, bring hostages home and raise the chances of restoring calm along Israel's border with Lebanon.The U.S. is Israel's closest ally and biggest arms supplier, though it has become sharply critical of the high civilian death toll, vast destruction and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza caused by the Israeli military campaign.The war raged on in Gaza on Tuesday as Israeli forces stepped up strikes on its southern city of Rafah a day after four soldiers were killed in an ambush claimed by Hamas.Israeli Army Radio said the soldiers died in an explosion in a building in Rafah's Shaboura district. Hamas said it had ambushed troops by detonating explosives planted in the building.HOPES FOR CEASEFIRE REPEATEDLY DASHEDBiden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, but there has been only one, week-long truce, in November, when over 100 hostages were freed in exchange for about 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.Israeli forces rescued four hostages held by Hamas in a commando raid into a crowded urban refugee camp in central Gaza on Saturday during which 274 Palestinians were killed by Israeli bombardments, according to Gaza's health authorities.There are over 100 hostages left in the coastal enclave, according to Israeli tallies, including at least 40 whom Israeli authorities have declared dead in absentia.

Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will fly to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in, and the two prime ministers will hold a meeting after the ceremony, according to government officials. A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime minister’s visit to India. It will be a two-day trip, says Rekha Sharma, Minister for Communication and Information Technology. On Wednesday, Modi phoned Prime Minister Dahal and they briefly discussed the upcoming meeting, according to government officials.Modi is set to become the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to serve three constitutive terms. The third term will be different from his first two as he was the prime minister backed by an absolute majority for his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, in the last two terms. This time, Modi has to rely on coalition partners under the banner of the National Democratic Alliance.With Modi entering his third term, will Nepal-India ties change, or will they remain the same? Modi has championed the “Neighborhood First” policy in his dealings with South Asian nations. Modi is the only Indian prime minister who has visited Nepal more than once—in 2014 and 2018, and again in 2022. Thus, he knows all top leaders of Nepal and is fully aware of bilateral issues, having served in the office for a decade.“India’s policy towards Nepal will not change. There is very much consistency in their policy towards Nepal,” said former foreign minister Ramesh Nath Pandey. “Modi will have control over Nepal policy.In the past decade, several Nepali prime ministers have visited India and interacted with Modi. The Indian prime minister is thus fully aware of Nepal’s concerns and interests, as well as India's expectations of Nepal. However, according to Pandey, Nepal has squandered a decade trying to shed the historical baggage and resolve bilateral differences.This time, the BJP’s coalition partner, the Janata Dal (United), hails from the bordering state of Bihar. The JDU has called for a review of India’s controversial Agnipath scheme, under which hundreds of Nepali youths used to be recruited into the Indian Army’s Gorkha regiments. The Nepal government has refused to allow India to recruit its youth under this short-term scheme, arguing that the 1947 agreement between Nepal, India and Britain stipulated full-term service in both the Indian and British Armies, not short-term enlistment.“Prime Minister Modi had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Nepal,” said an Indian government statement on Thursday. During the talks, Prime Minister Dahal congratulated Prime Minister Modi on his historic victory in the recently concluded Indian general elections, according to the statement.The statement said, “Dahal was convinced that, under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India-Nepal relations would continue to strengthen.”Nepal shares deep-rooted cultural and civilizational links with India and remains a special partner in India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, added the statement.Nepal and India have many commonalities and differences that surface from time to time. Issues like boundary disputes, Nepal’s call for scrapping the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950 and drafting a new one, and the submission of the report of the Eminent Persons Group on Nepal-India relations, among others, remain key bottlenecks in the bilateral ties. Once again, Modi has an opportunity to resolve them.Some Indian experts also claimed that although Modi’s new government will include several coalition partners, the policy towards Nepal will fundamentally remain unchanged. But Modi’s new term is full of challenges as he will have to rely on and persuade his alliance partners and this could lead to instability in governance.Ranjit Rae, former Indian ambassador to Nepal, said that India’s foreign policy will remain unchanged in Modi’s third term as there is broad consensus among the parties on key foreign policy issues. “As Nitish Kumar is in the government and Bihar shares a long border with Nepal, Nepal will remain important in the foreign policy architecture,” Rae said. “Primarily, India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy will continue.” On reviewing the Agnipath scheme, Rae said that it would be good if the new government reviewed it. According to the Indian media, there are hard bargains among coalition partners in New Delhi on power-sharing and it remains to be decided which party gets what portfolio.The two key alliance partners, N Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party and Nitish Kumar, both have secular credentials, so a party-centric foreign policy is unlikely to dominate during Modi’s third term, said Nihar Nayak, Research Fellow at the New Delhi-based Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA).According to Nayak, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) could see a revival, and as per the strong demands of Nitish Kumar’s JDU, the Agnipath scheme will also be scrapped.“If the Agnipath scheme is scrapped or reviewed, relations with Nepal will improve. The second thing is that there will be no BJP foreign policy. India’s insecurity in the region will diminish. The call for the restoration of the Hindu state in Nepal is unlikely to crop up as prominently. There will be changes in some aspects of foreign policy as Modi will be compelled to heed his coalition partners,” said Nayak. ","summary":"The caretaker Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, is all set to take the oath of office for the third constitutive term on Sunday evening, with the invited South Asian leaders to witness the ceremony. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will fly to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in, and the two prime ministers will hold a meeting after the ceremony, according to government officials. A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime minister’s visit to India. It will be a two-day trip, says Rekha Sharma, Minister for Communication and Information Technology. On Wednesday, Modi phoned Prime Minister Dahal and they briefly discussed the upcoming meeting, according to government officials.Modi is set to become the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to serve three constitutive terms. The third term will be different from his first two as he was the prime minister backed by an absolute majority for his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, in the last two terms. This time, Modi has to rely on coalition partners under the banner of the National Democratic Alliance.With Modi entering his third term, will Nepal-India ties change, or will they remain the same? Modi has championed the “Neighborhood First” policy in his dealings with South Asian nations. Modi is the only Indian prime minister who has visited Nepal more than once—in 2014 and 2018, and again in 2022. Thus, he knows all top leaders of Nepal and is fully aware of bilateral issues, having served in the office for a decade.“India’s policy towards Nepal will not change. There is very much consistency in their policy towards Nepal,” said former foreign minister Ramesh Nath Pandey. “Modi will have control over Nepal policy.In the past decade, several Nepali prime ministers have visited India and interacted with Modi. The Indian prime minister is thus fully aware of Nepal’s concerns and interests, as well as India's expectations of Nepal. However, according to Pandey, Nepal has squandered a decade trying to shed the historical baggage and resolve bilateral differences.This time, the BJP’s coalition partner, the Janata Dal (United), hails from the bordering state of Bihar. The JDU has called for a review of India’s controversial Agnipath scheme, under which hundreds of Nepali youths used to be recruited into the Indian Army’s Gorkha regiments. The Nepal government has refused to allow India to recruit its youth under this short-term scheme, arguing that the 1947 agreement between Nepal, India and Britain stipulated full-term service in both the Indian and British Armies, not short-term enlistment.“Prime Minister Modi had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Nepal,” said an Indian government statement on Thursday. During the talks, Prime Minister Dahal congratulated Prime Minister Modi on his historic victory in the recently concluded Indian general elections, according to the statement.The statement said, “Dahal was convinced that, under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India-Nepal relations would continue to strengthen.”Nepal shares deep-rooted cultural and civilizational links with India and remains a special partner in India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, added the statement.Nepal and India have many commonalities and differences that surface from time to time. Issues like boundary disputes, Nepal’s call for scrapping the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950 and drafting a new one, and the submission of the report of the Eminent Persons Group on Nepal-India relations, among others, remain key bottlenecks in the bilateral ties. Once again, Modi has an opportunity to resolve them.Some Indian experts also claimed that although Modi’s new government will include several coalition partners, the policy towards Nepal will fundamentally remain unchanged.

Even Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah has joined the chorus accusing Oli, who is also the UML chairman, of illegally swapping tea estate land, citing it as a clear case of policy corruption.The criticism from different quarters has put the UML on the defensive. And Oli is unable to hide his annoyance as questions come from all directions. His party is now defending the decision saying that the land swap was based on an amendment to the Land Act effected through a unanimous decision of the federal parliament.“No party opposed the Act’s amendment. The Nepali Congress also did not register any revision to the [amendment] bill. All the parties jointly passed the law,” said Yogesh Bhattarai, claiming it was wrong to accuse Oli and his party on the matter. He went on to say that the parties that helped revise that Act were now pointing fingers at the UML as the revision had been made without their notice.Against his claim, the Nepali Congress had registered amendments to the bill.

Cabinet decisions are deemed to be among such decisions. Even though the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority Act-1991 is silent on what constitutes a policy decision, the Supreme Court in 1996 sought to define it.As per the 1996 verdict issued by then-chief justice Surendra Prasad Singh and justices Keshav Prasad Upadhyaya, Laxman Prasad Aryal, Kedar Nath Upadhyay and Udayaraj Upadhyaya, decisions taken ‘collectively’ by the Cabinet to fulfil promises made in the election manifesto constitute ‘policy decisions’.Nepali politicians have long been spared from prosecution as decisions made in the Cabinet are termed policy decisions. The anti-graft body has directed the government and Parliament to define what constitutes a ‘policy decision’. Anti-corruption activists have also been seeking clarity on the concept for the same reason.The Oli government presented a bill to amend the Land Act in 2019. It was endorsed by both houses of the federal parliament in January 2020. Based on the new law, the Oli government on April 26, 2021 allowed the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate owners to swap 343.19 bighas (1 bigha equals 6,773 square metres) of land occupied by the tea estate. The decision was challenged in the Supreme Court. A constitutional bench of the court revoked the decision ruling it illegal.The opposition started lashing out at Oli and his party after the court verdict and its full text. This was not the first time that Parliament passed the bill unanimously and realised later that the executive had mala fide intent. On December 24, 2018, the government registered a bill in the federal parliament to amend a few laws. It included a proposal to revise the Nepal Trust Act. The bill revising 56 different laws was tabled for deliberations in the House of Representatives on January 1, 2019 and it was endorsed on February 15 unopposed. The National Assembly endorsed it on March 2 that year, before President Bidya Devi Bhandari authenticated it the very next day. However, the issue came to light only when the Oli government decided to lease out the land under the trust to the Yeti Group. Even the lawmakers who had voted for the revision criticised the law, having overlooked the issue during deliberations in the House.Legal experts say such incidents happen when the lawmaking process is not participatory and parliamentarians show little interest in study and deliberations. “The lawmaking process must be participatory right from its drafting process. It must be discussed widely in the House to make sure that it serves a right cause,” said advocate Mohan Acharya. Amid widespread criticism that law-making lacks broad participation, a bill is under consideration in the House to ensure that legislation becomes a more consultative process.“The bill, if passed, will ensure that bills are drafted after proper consultations with all stakeholders. They will be widely discussed before endorsement,” said Devkota. “In federal countries, central governments discuss bills with the provinces before tabling them in Parliament. Had this been done, there would not have been scams like Giri Bandhu.”Besides, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government is creating a mechanism for turning legislation into a more consultative process. Talking to law students on Sunday, Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri said the government was creating a Suggestion Bank to receive feedback on bills. “Such feedback and suggestions will be incorporated in the bills,” he said.

In today’s time, when power has ceased to be a zero-sum game and good leadership is synonymous with collaboration, the traditionally inclined old men clumsily spewing patriarchal narratives make civilised citizens extremely uncomfortable. Political women with independent political personhood have always been problematic to traditional men. Sahana’s grit, Shailaja’s impatience, Binda’s blatant feminism and Sumana’s formidability seem to have threatened those with the traditional bent of mind. At least two generations of strong, opinionated women have been sidelined or ousted because they did not fit into the mould of patriarchal party politics. It almost seems like the traditional men view them as political “shrews” who, like in the famous Shakespearean play The Taming of the Shrew, need to be “tamed”, cut to a size that is desirable to political patriarchy.Until not long ago, the concept of a “good woman” stemmed from feminine subservience and obedience. Women’s personhood was stunted through intense psychological conditioning that can be traced back to the origins of the state and society. A woman was told how her family’s honour rested on her good character. She was introduced to a heavy burden of feminine morality at an early age. With stories being fed about good women versus bad, patriarchy was very successful in grooming girls to grow up to be good women and obedient keepers of their family’s honour. Subservience was the prerequisite to being a good woman. A good woman was anything but defiant, and if by chance she did get tempted to disobey and defy the norms, she paid a hefty price. This “truth” was continuously fed into the feminine psyche, mostly through religious texts and scriptures. These women were duly punished in the ancient scriptures and medieval texts crafted and propagated by men.Vyaas wrote the story of how Draupadi was dragged by her hair and abused publicly because she had made fun of Duryodhana, leading to the great war between the Pandava and Kaurava brothers. Mother Mary was glorified as a virgin, while Mary Magdalene was vilified as a “loose” woman and had to be rescued. Sita’s disobedience tempted Ravana and caused much grief to Lord Ram. Eve disobeyed the Lord and ate the apple only to be the cause of Adam’s banishment. Khadija was a strong woman and a successful merchant before she married the Prophet, but she submitted herself to him and became his first disciple. In addition, the annual celebration of Swasthani Vrata Katha revered the ideal woman in the form of Goma Brahmani, who never protested, tolerated every injustice inflicted against her personhood. The idea of feminine morality has been strongly correlated with women’s socio-cultural subservience, religious conformity, psychological and economic fragility and physical docility. Even in politics, the men in charge prefer women who embody traditional femininity. However, here lies the problem: The idea of moral, subservient women clashes with the essence of equality and freedom propounded by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Women who have learned the freedoms cannot unlearn them. Today, several women in politics are highly qualified, independent, articulate and honest. They live the most painful existence because the unlearning of patriarchal values has already taken place within them, and they have a fully developed sense of personhood, which, however, is repeatedly obliterated by their party men or other political men who still operate by the patriarchal rules. Strong, independent, ethical women are repeatedly denied space in the party’s leadership. Educated, dignified, honest, resolute, independent and opinionated, Shailja Acharya was often ridiculed for her “short temper” and “moods”. In UML’s case, Sahana’s leadership in the inter-party women’s caucus irked her party men. An economist by training, she was more qualified than most men in her party, but her commitment to the larger political sorority was perceived as defiance; therefore, a covert “cutting to size” was practised against her as well. Narratives are created to invalidate women as viable leaders. These days, the “tamings” have become more overt. Binda Pandey, one of the handful of qualified women inside UML, was denied an election ticket, and the insider quickly pointed out that her “attitude” killed her prospects. The same has been the case with Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe, Kamala Panta, Shashi Shrestha, and others. Women’s recruitment, retention and promotions in parties seek obedient, subservient “yes-women” who do not have to be “tamed”. The latest “taming” attempt, however, appears much more menacing than the past. A woman with an ivy-league education, who speaks the global language, wears gender-neutral clothing, questions the old guards about procedural gaps, carries her own bags, drives her own car and has managed to keep herself out of the clout-centric politics so far, must irk the political retainers quite intensely to receive such blatant, overt attacks regarding her personal choices: From her clothing to her life partner. KP Oli has tried dismantling Sumana Shrestha’s political legitimacy and citizenship by calling Nepal her maita. The chauvinism that drips from Oli’s statement is disgustingly archaic, feudal and regressive for a leader of his stature.Bringing Shrestha into the helm of political give-and-take does not seem to have worked; if it had, Oli would not have had to start “taming” her. If she was unapologetically vocal as a member of the opposition, she seems adamant as a minister to fix the portfolio given to her. Maybe it is her “audacity” to fix the system at the ministry that has somehow miffed the old guard like Oli. His recent rants, aimed to paint her as a frivolous, westernised young woman whose political journey is a mere fluke, scream his intense insecurities. If that is indeed the case, then maybe Sumana Shrestha is doing something right, and we need more “shrew” muckrakers like her.  ","summary":"The collective indignity bestowed on political women, from Shailaja Acharya to Sumana Shrestha, by political patriarchs needs immediate redress.

But records show that millions of mobile phones with advanced features have been imported in the past two years.The rollout plan has been revived after the formation of the new government, which, according to insiders, is close to its northern neighbour, China, which has installed and supplied 5G equipment.“We introduced the new frequency policy around four months ago. Under this policy, all frequencies will go into technology neutrality from the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25,” said Paudyal. Technology neutrality allows service providers to use any technology in a given frequency, he said.Currently, there are two telecom service providers operating in the country—Telecom and Ncell.According to the telecom regulator, service providers can introduce 5G technology using existing frequencies or new ones. The authority says it is prepared to provide new frequencies through auction. Nepal Telecom was provided with a 2,600 Mhz frequency for the 5G trial. The authority provided the frequency for a year, and Nepal Telecom conducted an internal trial for around 2-3 months last October. It was said that Nepal Telecom would conduct a trial among the public, but that wasn’t meant to be. The regulator has written to Nepal Telecom to submit a report on the 5G trial.“Once it receives the report, the authority will proceed accordingly,” Paudyal said.While the government said it is ready to introduce 5G technology, the service providers said that since building the 5G ecosystem requires huge investment and as the country’s current economic situation is not so good, the market is not ready for the new mobile technology.It is estimated that service providers need to invest around Rs50-60 billion to implement 5G technology. Both the market and consumers are not ready for the technology, and there are device constraints, too.According to service providers, though mobile phone users’ demands have been growing in Nepal, daily data usage remains very low. Only two out of 10 Nepalis use mobile data regularly, according to Ncell, the private telecom provider.Ncell said in a recent statement that the average monthly data consumption per customer is only 4GB, which is low compared to other neighbouring countries.The telecom service providers are losing money and have outstanding dues due to the reduction in income.When Ncell introduced 4G in 2017, its annual income was Rs58-59 billion, which has now declined to Rs33-35 billion.Similarly, Nepal Telecom’s profit declined to Rs7.8 billion in the last fiscal year from Rs15.01 billion in 2017. According to a report by Cable.co.uk, the mobile data price measured from June to September 2023 is $0.43, or Rs57.38. The average cost of 1GB of data in India is $0.16, $0.12 in Pakistan, $0.23 in Bangladesh, $0.25 in Sri Lanka, $0.71 in Bhutan, and $2.16 in the Maldives. Mobile data prices are expensive in Nepal compared to other South Asian countries.Nepal Telecom concluded the 5G trial in four places in certain mobile sets to check whether the technology supports our network, said Hari Dhakal, spokesperson of Nepal Telecom.“As it requires a huge investment to bring the technology, we need to look at the cost, market readiness, return and other factors. So it will be difficult for us to go to the public immediately and we will not bring it unless we are assured of all the factors.”Jabbor Kayumov, CEO of Ncell, told a recent press meeting that after India, Ncell was looking to make Nepal the first country in South Asia to introduce 5G commercially. “But to get there, we need to take an important first step, and that is we need every Nepali to start using their mobile phones productively which means keeping mobile data always on.”Also, the government needs to create favourable conditions and reform laws to bring the new technology, company insiders say.For instance, a case involving Nepal Telecom and Ncell is under the court’s consideration. The government is forcefully asking telecom service providers to clear the frequency amount before the auction of 2,100 Mhz by bringing retrospective law, insiders say.3G was introduced in Nepal in 2007 and 4G in 2017.After the government announced an ‘economic decade’, digital economy topics are coming to the fore. “For a digital economy, digital transformation is necessary, which in turn calls for 5G technology. This is why the government has prioritised 5G,” Paudyal said. According to the 61st annual report of the Auditor General, Nepal Telecom spent Rs18.43 million for the trial of 5G in the current fiscal year. The audit has suggested that the company needs to be more effective in the implementation of 5G technology. ","summary":"After three years of halt, the much-awaited 5G frequency is set to be auctioned in Nepal.“The telecom regulator is ready to allow 5G frequency, and we are waiting for service providers’ response,” said Pradip Paudyal, deputy director of Nepal Telecommunications Authority.Paudyal, however, didn’t mention the auction date.“We have decided to auction the 5G frequency and are preparing for it,” he said.Paudyal said that to take part in the auction, service providers should clear all the dues they owe to the government.5G, or fifth-generation mobile technology, offers 10 times faster internet speed than its predecessor 4G and supports 10 times more devices per square kilometre.The state-owned phone company has announced several launch dates, but they have always been postponed for no apparent reason.The 5G rollout was originally planned in 2021 but came to an abrupt halt, which insiders said was due to geopolitics.American and Indian embassies’ officials recently told the Post that they were concerned about the Nepal government allowing the Chinese companies to conduct the 5G tests without going through a competitive bidding process.Nepal Telecom has also been saying that there aren’t enough 5G compatible phones in Kathmandu and other cities to warrant launching the new technology. But records show that millions of mobile phones with advanced features have been imported in the past two years.The rollout plan has been revived after the formation of the new government, which, according to insiders, is close to its northern neighbour, China, which has installed and supplied 5G equipment.“We introduced the new frequency policy around four months ago. Under this policy, all frequencies will go into technology neutrality from the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25,” said Paudyal. Technology neutrality allows service providers to use any technology in a given frequency, he said.Currently, there are two telecom service providers operating in the country—Telecom and Ncell.According to the telecom regulator, service providers can introduce 5G technology using existing frequencies or new ones. The authority says it is prepared to provide new frequencies through auction. Nepal Telecom was provided with a 2,600 Mhz frequency for the 5G trial. The authority provided the frequency for a year, and Nepal Telecom conducted an internal trial for around 2-3 months last October. It was said that Nepal Telecom would conduct a trial among the public, but that wasn’t meant to be. The regulator has written to Nepal Telecom to submit a report on the 5G trial.“Once it receives the report, the authority will proceed accordingly,” Paudyal said.While the government said it is ready to introduce 5G technology, the service providers said that since building the 5G ecosystem requires huge investment and as the country’s current economic situation is not so good, the market is not ready for the new mobile technology.It is estimated that service providers need to invest around Rs50-60 billion to implement 5G technology.

The court asked the commission and other authorities to put the process on hold, and the case is still sub judice. When the court gives a verdict on the issue, the JSP-Nepal's fence-sitters may decide whether to remain with the party or defect to the new outfit.Just a week before the unity general convention, the party suffered another setback as it had to give up the chief minister’s post in Madhesh Province when the erstwhile coalition partners–the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre)—withdrew their support to the government. During the floor test held on June 5 JSP-Nepal lawmaker Saroj Kumar Yadav, the immediate past chief minister of the province, fell 4 votes short from securing the position. When he garnered 50 votes in support, 53 members voted against him. In the 107-strong assembly, the chief minister has to secure at least 54 votes in support.Upendra Yadav's parties, including the current JSP-Nepal, continuously led the provincial government for almost seven years until Satish Kumar Singh of the Janamat Party dethroned Yadav’s party from the chief ministerial position on June 7.Though the recent party split and the dethroning of the Madhesh Province’s leadership can be blamed on the party leadership, according to analysts, the unity general convention poses little challenge to Yadav. Because of the split, there are no leaders left in the party who’d challenge Yadav, Chandra Kishore, an observer of Madhesh politics, told the Post. “Therefore, the general convention should be a walk in the park for him.” The party that held its statute convention last year adopted a policy of lobbying for a directly elected presidential system in the country. Likewise, the Madhesh-based party set the goal of fighting for a parliament with fully proportional representation. This is expected to direct policy at the unity convention. However, experts question the sustainability of the policies adopted by the statute convention in the party's post-split situation.“The policies adopted by the statute convention will remain intact,” Prakash Adhikari, a federal lawmaker of the party, told the Post. “The party division, which is sub judice in the Supreme Court, will not impact policy changes.”Chandra Kishore, who has been following Madhesh politics for a long time, differs from Adhikari.“Yadav is a political strategist. He acts as per the situation,” he said. “He will not necessarily act as per the party documents.” The JSP-Nepal’s central committee in January, two months before the split, decided to hold the unity general convention in June. The party decided to organise the convention in order to consolidate the unity between various Madhes-based parties over time, party leaders said.This is the first unity convention held after the merger of various Madhes-based parties, Manish Kumar Suman, spokesperson for the JSP-Nepal, told the Post.The Tarai Madhesh Loktantrik Party, led by Mahantha Thakur; the Rastriya Madhesh Samajbadi Party, led by Sarat Singh Bhandari; the Tarai Madhesh Sadbhawana Party, led by Mahendra Yadav’ the Sadbhawana Party, led by Rajendra Mahato; the Madheshi Janadhikar Ganatantrik Party, led by Raj Kishor Yadav; and Anil Jha’s Nepal Sadbhawana Party merged to form the Rastriya Janata Party before the 2017 general and provincial elections.The Rastriya Janata Party and the Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party led by Upendra Yadav fought the 2017 elections with a tie-up in Madhesh but merged the parties in 2020 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party. When the erstwhile prime minister KP Sharma Oli issued an ordinance to split the Yadav-led party to counterbalance a rift within his Nepal Communist Party (NCP) formed after the merger of the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) following the 2017 election, the merger in the two Madhesh-based parties was hastened. Before this, the only Madheshi party to hold the general convention periodically was the Nepal Sadbhawana Party. Gajendra Narayan Singh, who formed the Nepal Sadbhabana Council in 1985, turned the council into a party following the first people’s movement of 1990.Yadav’s will be another Madhesh-based party to hold the general convention more than once, Suman said.Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates a political party to hold its general convention at least once in five years. However, if the office bearers cannot be elected in five years due to a situation arising out of special circumstances, based on the statute of a political party, new leaders can be elected within six months thereafter. The constitutional time frame is not mandatory for a new party or one formed after a split. As Nepal’s regional parties often suffer splits, they rarely hold the general convention periodically.The Upendra Yadav-led Madheshi Janadhikar Forum (MJF) held its second convention in 2009, in Birgunj, just after the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. The MJF was a rights-based organisation before it entered politics after the first Madhesh uprising of 2007. JSP-Nepal spokesperson Suman said Yadav has led various political parties, but this is the second time an outfit he leads is holding the general convention.The Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar-led Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (Loktantrik) held its first general convention in Biratnagar in May 2016. The same year, Nepal Sadbhawana Party also held its general conventions in April.The JSP-Nepal has invited foreign dignitaries to the unity convention. The party's foreign affairs department chief, Arjun Thapa, said delegates from India, Malaysia, Azerbaijan, Spain, and Indonesia have already arrived in Nepal.Invitations have been extended to various parties, except the Janata Samajbadi Party led by Ashok Rai, which splintered from the JSP-Nepal. The Nepali Congress, the UML, the Maoist Centre, the Rastriya Swatantra Party, the Rastriya Prajantra Party, and the CPN (Unified Socialist) are other parties that will participate in the Janakpur convention. Party leaders say the opening ceremony will be held on Monday, whereas the closed session, which will discuss the party’s political documents, is scheduled for the subsequent days.

After a change in coalition at the centre began to affect provincial governments, voices for reforming the electoral system through constitutional amendment are growing louder. Speaking at a programme in Kathmandu on Saturday, Thapa, a general secretary of the largest party in the House of Representatives, argued that reforming the electoral system had become necessary to ensure political stability. He also said that the provinces’ performance so far shows that the federal system cannot be sustained in its current form. “By reform in the provincial structure, I do not mean scrapping the federal system altogether, which the country cannot afford,” Thapa told the Post when asked to explain his statement. “The issue of governments’ formation in the provinces has been challenged in court. This is a result of lack of clarity on provincial government formation in the constitution.”The government formation process in Koshi and Gandaki provinces have been challenged multiple times, and the Supreme Court has many times invalidated the chief ministerial appointment and election processes in the two provinces.Questions have been raised over the expenditures for running the provincial governments. “To address this issue, we need to downsize the elected representatives’ bodies not only in the provinces but also at the federal level. For that, we need constitutional reform,” Thapa added. “We bear a collective responsibility to protect and sustain the constitution. This, however, requires some amendments. Reform in the electoral system is as important,” Thapa emphasised. The provinces followed the same process of government formation practised at the centre and that caused problems, he said. Thapa stressed that amendments to the constitution could address all these issues.The Congress leader says it is wrong to advocate either for scrapping the federal system altogether or and fully retaining the constitutional provisions on the provinces. The Rastriya Prajantara Party, which bats for the revival of the Hindu Kingdom, has been demanding the scrapping of the country’s federal structure. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, which was formed two years ago, also wants the provincial structure overhauled. The new party says it wants to downsize the middle layer of the federal system. The party hasn’t participated in the provincial elections.Former National Assembly member Khim Lal Devkota, who is also an expert on federalism and a columnist at The Post, sees a slim chance of any changes in the federal system even though “it is necessary”.“I have closely worked with Nepal’s top political leaders. I believe they won’t readily amend the constitution,” Devkota told the Post. “The longer we take to amend the constitution, the more questions there will be on the longevity of the constitution.” During the Congress Mahasamiti meeting held in February, many leaders raised their voices in favour of filling all seats of the lower house of the federal parliament through direct election. Instead of electing a section of the lower house under the Proportional Representation (PR) system, the leaders had suggested that the upper house of the parliament be filled exclusively through the PR system. They were of the view that Nepal would not have a stable government unless all the lower house members were directly elected by their constituencies.Devkota is also of the opinion that Nepal needs to reform the election system. The mixed electoral system should be changed to create an environment for political instability, he said.In the 275-strong federal lower house, 165 are directly elected, whereas 110 come from the PR category. The upper chamber has 59 members. Of them, 56 are chosen through an electoral college comprising provincial assembly members and the chiefs and deputy chiefs of local units. Each province elects eight members, while three are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Council of Ministers.Likewise, among the 550 members in the seven provincial assemblies, 220 are elected under the PR category. This number is large compared to the population size and thus needs to be reduced significantly, say experts.However, Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, blames the political leaders for the current problems of the provinces. Top politicians are using provincial governments and assemblies to place their second- and third-tier leaders. This has burdened the state without yielding any tangible results, he added. Pokharel says this represents a failure of the leadership rather than the federal system.Since the inception of the provincial system, political parties have appointed chief ministers on a rotational basis, Pokharel told the Post. “It is true that there are operational problems in the provinces, but leaders are more responsible for this than the system.” Even though the state structure is federal, political parties have yet to adopt the three-tier system within their organisations, he said. “What stops the political parties from giving autonomy to their provincial committees and letting them make decisions regarding the provinces on their own?” Pokharel questioned.Devkota, however, said two models should be considered to ensure the stability of provincial governments.The first involves distributing the government leadership positions based on the number of seats won in the election, and the second concerns implementing provisions similar to those at the local government level. According to the first model, the chief minister and other positions are distributed based on the number of seats shared in the provincial assembly elections, and the government is run among the constituent parties on a consensus basis.As per the second method, the chief minister is directly elected by voters, similar to the election of mayors or chairs at the local units. This makes the chief ministers fully accountable to the people. The chief minister can be removed by a two-thirds majority of the provincial assembly, thus preventing one from being an autocrat. One of the major concerns is the destabilising linkage of provincial politics with the power equation in Kathmandu. When the coalition at the centre changes, governments in the provinces also change.The subnational governments changed immediately after the change in coalition partners in Kathmandu on March 4. When Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal changed ruling partners, the second-largest party in the House of Representatives, CPN-UML, joined the government while the largest force, the Congress, was ousted from power. The changes at the centre immediately triggered changes in the provinces as well. ","summary":"Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa has joined the group of leaders calling for a constitutional amendment in order to address the underperforming provincial system and the political instability allegedly caused by the mixed electoral system the country constitutionally endorsed nearly a decade ago. After a change in coalition at the centre began to affect provincial governments, voices for reforming the electoral system through constitutional amendment are growing louder. Speaking at a programme in Kathmandu on Saturday, Thapa, a general secretary of the largest party in the House of Representatives, argued that reforming the electoral system had become necessary to ensure political stability. He also said that the provinces’ performance so far shows that the federal system cannot be sustained in its current form. “By reform in the provincial structure, I do not mean scrapping the federal system altogether, which the country cannot afford,” Thapa told the Post when asked to explain his statement. “The issue of governments’ formation in the provinces has been challenged in court. This is a result of lack of clarity on provincial government formation in the constitution.”The government formation process in Koshi and Gandaki provinces have been challenged multiple times, and the Supreme Court has many times invalidated the chief ministerial appointment and election processes in the two provinces.Questions have been raised over the expenditures for running the provincial governments. “To address this issue, we need to downsize the elected representatives’ bodies not only in the provinces but also at the federal level. For that, we need constitutional reform,” Thapa added. “We bear a collective responsibility to protect and sustain the constitution. This, however, requires some amendments. Reform in the electoral system is as important,” Thapa emphasised. The provinces followed the same process of government formation practised at the centre and that caused problems, he said. Thapa stressed that amendments to the constitution could address all these issues.The Congress leader says it is wrong to advocate either for scrapping the federal system altogether or and fully retaining the constitutional provisions on the provinces. The Rastriya Prajantara Party, which bats for the revival of the Hindu Kingdom, has been demanding the scrapping of the country’s federal structure. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, which was formed two years ago, also wants the provincial structure overhauled. The new party says it wants to downsize the middle layer of the federal system. The party hasn’t participated in the provincial elections.Former National Assembly member Khim Lal Devkota, who is also an expert on federalism and a columnist at The Post, sees a slim chance of any changes in the federal system even though “it is necessary”.“I have closely worked with Nepal’s top political leaders. I believe they won’t readily amend the constitution,” Devkota told the Post. “The longer we take to amend the constitution, the more questions there will be on the longevity of the constitution.” During the Congress Mahasamiti meeting held in February, many leaders raised their voices in favour of filling all seats of the lower house of the federal parliament through direct election. Instead of electing a section of the lower house under the Proportional Representation (PR) system, the leaders had suggested that the upper house of the parliament be filled exclusively through the PR system. They were of the view that Nepal would not have a stable government unless all the lower house members were directly elected by their constituencies.Devkota is also of the opinion that Nepal needs to reform the election system. The mixed electoral system should be changed to create an environment for political instability, he said.In the 275-strong federal lower house, 165 are directly elected, whereas 110 come from the PR category. The upper chamber has 59 members. Of them, 56 are chosen through an electoral college comprising provincial assembly members and the chiefs and deputy chiefs of local units. Each province elects eight members, while three are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Council of Ministers.Likewise, among the 550 members in the seven provincial assemblies, 220 are elected under the PR category. This number is large compared to the population size and thus needs to be reduced significantly, say experts.However, Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, blames the political leaders for the current problems of the provinces. Top politicians are using provincial governments and assemblies to place their second- and third-tier leaders. This has burdened the state without yielding any tangible results, he added.

Following her request, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal handed the report to the ministry on Monday.Shrestha consulted the commission members on Thursday. The ministry stated that the report’s recommendations will be implemented under Dahal’s leadership.The statement quoted Shrestha as saying, \"The government will implement positive and contextual suggestions.\"In August 2018, the government formed a 25-member commission led by Education Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel.

On January 15, 2019, it was submitted to Oli. However, Oli was not interested in implementing the recommendations, so he never made the report public. His successor, Sher Bahadur Deuba, also followed suit.The commission has recommended that private schools be converted into “trusts” within 10 years. This would, according to the commission, stop the commercialisation of education. Conversion into trust means that the school owners cannot distribute their profits.

It also suggested partnerships between private and public schools to improve the latter’s quality.Hiring head teachers on contract after evaluating their performance, increasing education budget to at least 20 percent of the government’s spending as per its commitment and ensuring that every child gets basic education in his/her mother tongue are other major recommendations of the commission.Despite Nepal’s global commitment, the proportion of the national budget allocated to the education sector has been declining.

In the 107-strong Madhesh assembly, the support of 54 assembly members is required for a simple majority.The federal coalition of the Maoist Centre, the CPN-UML and the Janamat Party, among others, is set to stake claim to a new government in the province. CPN (Maoist Centre) leader Yuvaraj Bhattarai claimed that although 53 assembly members voted against Yadav on Wednesday, the new coalition has 55 votes in the assembly and its candidate will swiftly win the chief ministership.“Assembly members representing the Nagarik Unmukti Party and Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party were absent during the trust vote, but they are with us,” Bhattarai told the Post. The two parties each have an assembly member. With 25 members, the CPN-UML is the largest party in Madhesh provincial assembly, while the Congress is second-largest with 22 members. Likewise, the JSP-Nepal has 19, the Janamat Party 13, the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party Nepal 9, the CPN (Maoist Centre) 9, the CPN (Unified Socialist) 7 and the Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party, the Nagarik Unmukti Party and the Rastriya Prajatantra Party one each.Earlier, leaders from the CPN-UML, the CPN (Maoist Centre), and the CPN (Unified Socialist) had reportedly agreed to form the provincial government in Madhesh under the leadership of CK Raut-led Janamat party’s provincial assembly leader. On May 30, Janamat Party chair Raut had announced that the federal coalition members including Mahantha Thakur-led Loktantrik Samajbadi Party Nepal would support his party to form the government in Madhesh. However, leaders from Thakur’s party and the Unified Socialist had said they have yet to make an official decision.Yadav, provincial assembly leader of the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal, was appointed the chief minister on January 11, 2023.The Yadav-led provincial government lost the majority after the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) withdrew their support on May 12.The chief minister went for the floor test as per the mandatory provision of the constitution. This provision requires a chief minister to undergo a floor test within 30 days if the party the chief minister represents splits or a coalition partner withdraws its support.Upendra Yadav’s parties, including the current JSP-Nepal, had been in power in Madhesh Province for nearly seven consecutive years. Yadav formed several parties over the past seven years through splits or mergers. The latest split of Yadav’s JSP-Nepal happened on May 5, when its federal chair Ashok Rai, backed by several senior leaders, launched a new Janata Samajbadi Party. The Election Commission recognised the new party on May 6, compelling Chief Minister Yadav to undergo a floor test as per Article 188 (2) of the Constitution. “If the political party which the Chief Minister represents is divided or a political party in coalition Government withdraws its support, the Chief Minister shall table a resolution in the State Assembly for a vote of confidence within thirty days,” reads the Article of the Constitution. Earlier, Chief Minister Yadav had planned to defer the trust vote. He had requested the assembly to reschedule the vote for Monday next week, citing his poor health. However, he later agreed to face the assembly due to fear of ‘automatically’ losing the position. Leaders from rival parties had claimed that Yadav would lose the position based on the date of the split of the JSP-Nepal if he refused to undergo a floor test. There were also legal questions over the requirement for floor test as the Supreme Court, acting on a petition by Upendra Yadav, has ordered the election body to freeze the registration of the Ashok Rai-led party, until a final verdict.On Wednesday evening, Province Head Sumitra Bhandari invited parties for government formation in accordance with Article 168(2) of the Constitution.

Lawmaker Sharma said that in case of conflict between a central agency and a local unit, the federal government should show more restraint than the local government.“Mayor Balendra Shah’s initiative to widen pavements at New Road is the right step for the general public’s convenience,” Sharma told the House. “Mayor Shah should be allowed to continue his work without any interference as what he is doing is absolutely right.”The conflict escalated when the Road Division, under the federal government, intervened and paved the road cut by the metropolis on Monday. The metropolis had cleared stretches a few metres wide on either side of the road to create space for pavements. The dispute resulted in a standoff between those deployed by the Road Division and the Kathmandu municipal staff, with different people taking different sides. The tension eased without any untoward incident as the metropolis backed off after the federal government deployed police at the site.The Road Division, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is led by Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth, who is a UML secretary. The dispute grew to involve those supporting Mayor Shah and the UML, the biggest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, and also spilled over to social media.In Parliament, lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress threw their weight behind Shah.Not only the party’s general secretary Sharma, two other lawmakers from the party also expressed their support for the mayor in the House meeting on Thursday. Congress lawmaker Arjun Narsingh KC said the conflict between the federal government and the Kathmandu mayor has raised serious questions about the federal government’s intent. KC stressed that cooperation and collaboration between the federal, provincial, and local governments is essential in avoiding conflict and resolving disputes between the three federal units. He said Articles 232 and 235 of the constitution and related schedules clearly define their jurisdictions.“The recent conflict between the federal and local governments and the saga of making and breaking of a road section have raised serious questions,” KC said. He urged the government not to resort to violence and to resolve the issue in a rational way.Another Congress lawmaker, Kanti Sejuwal, also speaking in the zero hour of Parliament, questioned the government for clashing with the municipal authority. “Either we should scrap the Local Government Operation Act 2017, or the federal government should let Balendra work.”As the Road Division intervened in Mayor Shah’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area, Sejuwal had expressed his anger at UML chair Oli.Following the federal agency’s intervention, the mayor wrote on social media, alleging Oli’s involvement in the attempted illegal swapping of land at the Birtamode-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate worth billions of rupees. The largest party, the Congress, had been accusing the UML chief of being complicit in the land swap issue.A few days ago, Shah also engaged in a heated exchange with the KMC’s Ward 22 chairman Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member, over the sidewalk expansion. Even before that, municipal staff dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Kathmandu Road Division office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had inconvenienced the public.Earlier, on May 14, the Congress parliamentary party meeting had decided to raise the issue of the tea estate land in Parliament. The Oli government, formed after the 2017 general elections, allowed the owners of the tea estate to swap 343.19 bighas (232.43 hectares) of land it occupied, based on a revision to the Land Act (1964). The Act was revised in January 2020, under the Oli administration, introducing a provision for allowing a swap or selling of land to pay off the tea estate’s liabilities if it went into liquidation. Asked if the Congress had backed the mayor as he alleged the UML chair Oli’s involvement in the Tea Estate land scam, the Congress publicity department head Min Bahadur Bishwokarma denied it. “Party lawmakers including the general secretary must have backed the mayor as the New Road sidewalk issue is of public concern, and not necessarily because it involves the UML,” Bishwokarma said.

Lawmaker Sharma said that in case of conflict between a central agency and a local unit, the federal government should show more restraint than the local government.“Mayor Balendra Shah’s initiative to widen pavements at New Road is the right step for the general public’s convenience,” Sharma told the House. “Mayor Shah should be allowed to continue his work without any interference as what he is doing is absolutely right.”The conflict escalated when the Road Division, under the federal government, intervened and paved the road cut by the metropolis on Monday. The metropolis had cleared stretches a few metres wide on either side of the road to create space for pavements. The dispute resulted in a standoff between those deployed by the Road Division and the Kathmandu municipal staff, with different people taking different sides. The tension eased without any untoward incident as the metropolis backed off after the federal government deployed police at the site.The Road Division, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is led by Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth, who is a UML secretary. The dispute grew to involve those supporting Mayor Shah and the UML, the biggest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, and also spilled over to social media.In Parliament, lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress threw their weight behind Shah.Not only the party’s general secretary Sharma, two other lawmakers from the party also expressed their support for the mayor in the House meeting on Thursday. Congress lawmaker Arjun Narsingh KC said the conflict between the federal government and the Kathmandu mayor has raised serious questions about the federal government’s intent. KC stressed that cooperation and collaboration between the federal, provincial, and local governments is essential in avoiding conflict and resolving disputes between the three federal units. He said Articles 232 and 235 of the constitution and related schedules clearly define their jurisdictions.“The recent conflict between the federal and local governments and the saga of making and breaking of a road section have raised serious questions,” KC said. He urged the government not to resort to violence and to resolve the issue in a rational way.Another Congress lawmaker, Kanti Sejuwal, also speaking in the zero hour of Parliament, questioned the government for clashing with the municipal authority. “Either we should scrap the Local Government Operation Act 2017, or the federal government should let Balendra work.”As the Road Division intervened in Mayor Shah’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area, Sejuwal had expressed his anger at UML chair Oli.Following the federal agency’s intervention, the mayor wrote on social media, alleging Oli’s involvement in the attempted illegal swapping of land at the Birtamode-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate worth billions of rupees. The largest party, the Congress, had been accusing the UML chief of being complicit in the land swap issue.A few days ago, Shah also engaged in a heated exchange with the KMC’s Ward 22 chairman Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member, over the sidewalk expansion. Even before that, municipal staff dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Kathmandu Road Division office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had inconvenienced the public.Earlier, on May 14, the Congress parliamentary party meeting had decided to raise the issue of the tea estate land in Parliament. The Oli government, formed after the 2017 general elections, allowed the owners of the tea estate to swap 343.19 bighas (232.43 hectares) of land it occupied, based on a revision to the Land Act (1964). The Act was revised in January 2020, under the Oli administration, introducing a provision for allowing a swap or selling of land to pay off the tea estate’s liabilities if it went into liquidation. Asked if the Congress had backed the mayor as he alleged the UML chair Oli’s involvement in the Tea Estate land scam, the Congress publicity department head Min Bahadur Bishwokarma denied it. “Party lawmakers including the general secretary must have backed the mayor as the New Road sidewalk issue is of public concern, and not necessarily because it involves the UML,” Bishwokarma said.

Officials said they started fixing potholes, concreting and other works on Wednesday.“We have allocated Rs30 million for the repairs, and the work started on Wednesday after completing the tender process,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC). “We have asked the contractor to complete the work at the earliest in view of the looming monsoon.”Every year, garbage disposal is affected during the monsoon season due to rain, landslides, and poor road conditions. Sometimes, garbage disposal is disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions result in a complete halt in door-to-door garbage collection for weeks, leading locals in the Valley to discard their trash on the streets and causing chaos in the city.“We are aware of the risks associated with obstructions in garbage disposal and their consequences,” said Shrestha. “We have been taking measures accordingly to lessen all possible risks.”The metropolis said that around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised.Meteorologists in Nepal anticipate the onset of monsoon by the end of next week, a few days ahead of the usual June 13 arrival of the weather system from the Bay of Bengal.KMC is also considering purchasing a high-pressure pump to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground. Recently, locals in the Sisdole area protested and stopped the trucks from disposing of garbage alleging the KMC’s negligence in leachate control.Municipal officials said that the Ministry of Urban Development took away a high-pressure pumpset from the landfill site's leachate pond some three months ago for maintenance, but has yet to return it. Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The city office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled.

The report forecasts that Nepal will generate 1.22 million jobs in 2024.The jobs generated by the tourism sector is 15.2 percent of the total. The London-based organisation said travel and tourism’s total contribution to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) stood at 6.6 percent to Rs358.9 billion or $2.7 billion last year, down from 6.7 percent in 2019 before the start of the Covid pandemic.All values are in constant 2023 prices and exchange rates. This primarily reflects the economic activity generated by sectors such as hotels, travel agencies, airlines and other passenger transport services, excluding commuter services. It also includes, for example, the activities of the restaurant and leisure industries directly supported by tourists.The annual report said domestic visitors are the biggest spenders who spent Rs210.8 billion last year and are expected to fork out Rs226.8 billion this year. This translates to 71.5 percent of the total spending in the tourism sector. Nepalis started touring their own country in significant numbers after the 2015 earthquake, according to hoteliers.Apart from traditional leisure destinations like Pokhara and Chitwan, the famous Annapurna Base Camp trail, Mardi and Manaslu treks were the big draw for domestic adventurers. But the Covid pandemic had put a damper on tourism.“Domestic tourism has now fully recovered,” said Mani Raj Lamichhane, director at the Research, Planning and Monitoring Department of Nepal Tourism Board (NTB).“There is no actual data on domestic movement but based on the occupancies reported by hotels in key tourism hubs like Pokhara and Chitwan, the domestic tourist growth has been phenomenal,” said Lamichhane.“Due to bad roads, domestic tourist movement in Lumbini, however, has dropped significantly, even though Pokhara has not been much affected.” Domestic airlines are reporting robust passenger traffic in destinations like Pokhara, Bhairahawa and Bharatpur due to the ongoing road expansion projects. “We are operating 40 flights [landing and takeoff] from the Pokhara International Airport, with the number of flights doubling in the past six months,” said Dipendra Karna, communication manager at Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier. Buddha operates 34 flights on the Pokhara-Kathmandu-Pokhara route and connects Nepalgunj, Bhairahawa and Bharatpur with Pokhara. On April 14, Buddha Air recorded the highest-ever single-day passenger traffic, flying 3,000 passengers in and out of Pokhara.Karna said passengers in key tourist destinations are mostly Nepalis followed by Indians. “We are 95 percent occupied in Pokhara,” said Karna.Besides, the number of sightseers travelling from Beni to Jomsom by motorcycle has also risen sharply after the construction of the Beni-Jomsom road. According to the report, international visitors spent an estimated Rs83.9 billion or $633.7 million last year. This spending is projected to grow to Rs102.6 billion in 2024.Of the total expenditure, 83.4 percent was spent on leisure and the remaining on business. The country welcomed more than a million tourists between January and December last year, following China’s border reopening and record arrivals from India. According to the Nepal Tourism Board, the country's tourism promotional body, the arrival numbers crossed the million mark for the first time in four years.The government, through the budget, has announced to draw 1.6 million foreign visitors this year.According to industry insiders, the government’s target is attainable, but there are a few challenges this year.From November 8, Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport will be closed daily for 10 hours, from 10 pm to 8 am for five months until March 31, for the expansion of the taxiways.September-November is Nepal’s peak tourist season. “The construction in the peak season will reduce flight frequency and as a result, airfare may rise,” said Lamichhane. Subash Jha, spokesperson at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport, said that at least 12 flights may be affected. “As there are no parking slots during daytime, rescheduling will be difficult. We, however, have requested airline companies to use Nepal’s two new international airports in Pokhara and Bhairahawa. We are ready to facilitate them.”Jha said a round of discussion with a few foreign airlines has been completed to ensure the flights do not suffer. “It will depend on airlines whether they are willing to operate from the new airports. We, however, cannot force them.”Besides, industry insiders say the Nepal Tourism Board has been headless for the past four months, affecting all international promotional and marketing events.Foreign arrivals had crossed the one million mark for the first time in 2018 when the country hosted 1.17 million visitors from abroad. The number reached 1.19 million in 2019. Then the Covid pandemic started in early 2020, bringing arrivals to a standstill. Travel restrictions and an economic slowdown triggered by the pandemic delivered a massive blow to Nepal's burgeoning tourism industry, decimating revenues and profits after 2020.Nepal received 230,085 and 150,962 tourists in 2020 and 2021, respectively. In 2022, the foreign tourist numbers shot up to 614,869.

According to the Nepal Tourism Board, the country's tourism promotional body, the arrival numbers crossed the million mark for the first time in four years.The government, through the budget, has announced to draw 1.6 million foreign visitors this year.According to industry insiders, the government’s target is attainable, but there are a few challenges this year.From November 8, Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport will be closed daily for 10 hours, from 10 pm to 8 am for five months until March 31, for the expansion of the taxiways.September-November is Nepal’s peak tourist season. “The construction in the peak season will reduce flight frequency and as a result, airfare may rise,” said Lamichhane. Subash Jha, spokesperson at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport, said that at least 12 flights may be affected. “As there are no parking slots during daytime, rescheduling will be difficult. We, however, have requested airline companies to use Nepal’s two new international airports in Pokhara and Bhairahawa. We are ready to facilitate them.”Jha said a round of discussion with a few foreign airlines has been completed to ensure the flights do not suffer. “It will depend on airlines whether they are willing to operate from the new airports. We, however, cannot force them.”Besides, industry insiders say the Nepal Tourism Board has been headless for the past four months, affecting all international promotional and marketing events.Foreign arrivals had crossed the one million mark for the first time in 2018 when the country hosted 1.17 million visitors from abroad. The number reached 1.19 million in 2019. Then the Covid pandemic started in early 2020, bringing arrivals to a standstill. Travel restrictions and an economic slowdown triggered by the pandemic delivered a massive blow to Nepal's burgeoning tourism industry, decimating revenues and profits after 2020.Nepal received 230,085 and 150,962 tourists in 2020 and 2021, respectively. In 2022, the foreign tourist numbers shot up to 614,869.

The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,105 people from 69 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 69 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 112. Jhapa district recorded 109 cases, followed by Chitwan (73), Makwanpur (58), Sindhupalchok (44), Tanahun (39), Okhaldhunga (38), Doti (30), Rupandehi (28), and Bhaktapur (27). The three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur—together reported 157 cases of infections in this period.Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa, and Kalikot are among the mountain districts that have reported dengue cases.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Post-monsoon is considered a highly transmissible season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease around the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Experts say this is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks.Waiting for a massive outbreak would be a big mistake, they say. To reduce the risk, authorities should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance, and take other measures. Health ministry officials said that they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.“Even if massive outbreaks have not been seen in any place, many districts have already reported dengue cases,” said Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “We have alerted all relevant agencies to the risk of an outbreak in the coming days.”Authorities and agencies in some local units have launched activities to raise residents' awareness of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, Dahal said.Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities do not take it seriously. They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients having these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.

On Tuesday, Dhangadhi recorded 40.4 degrees Celsius, Nepalgunj 40.2 degrees Celsius and Birendranagar 37.3 degrees Celsius, the Met office’s data shows.Met officials anticipate monsoon will start at the end of next week and bring respite from scorching heat.Over 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 are being inoculated with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in a nationwide immunisation drive started on May 26.Officials said that children who missed the IPV vaccine during the routine immunisation programme will be administered the vaccine, as they are at risk of getting infected with Type-2 polio.Gautam said that vaccination programmes are being carried out smoothly in the rest of the places. The vaccine is being administered in schools, booths and health posts.Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but the World Health Organisation officially declared it polio-free on March 27, 2014 after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV).The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus.The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus.However, the Type -2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in the South Asia region to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN Health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Gautam said that due to global shortages of the IPV vaccine, children born between April 13, 2016, and October 18, 2018 were inoculated only with the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine.“Children who missed the IPV vaccine will be at high risk of poliovirus infection,” Gautam said. “So we are launching a campaign to inoculate them.”Health officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.Childhood immunisation is the number one priority of the government, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, however, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all.This figure was one percent in 2016.The Ministry of Health and Population said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country.

Public health experts, however, are sceptical of its success, as neonatal deaths have not declined since 2016, and the measures taken at present are not sufficient to lessen the ongoing death rates.“Both the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 and the finance ministry’s recent report show neonatal deaths constantly high,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “It will not be easy to pick high-hanging fruits. It requires a lot of investments and micro planning, which are currently lacking.”A recent report by the Ministry of Finance shows that 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births, the same results shown by the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The 16th five-year plan, which starts next fiscal year and ends in 2029, is aligned with the SDG targets.Public health experts say meeting the goal is easier said than done. Most health facilities having birthing centres lack neonatal units, trained human resources, and quality services.“Without ensuring quality services, which require trained human resources and advanced facilities, among others, it is impossible to reduce neonatal deaths,” said Upreti. “The government has made various plans to reduce child deaths—including neonatal deaths—but does not pay much attention to their effective implementation.”The finance ministry’s recent report shows that the institutional delivery rate increased to 80 percent from 79 percent last year. The rise in institutional deliveries has contributed to lessening the maternal mortality rate, which is 151 in every 100,000 live births.“Fifty percent of the neonates die in the first 24 hours of birth,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services. “Most of our health facilities, including birthing centres, lack proper infrastructures.”Study shows that 85 percent of all deaths among children under the age of five in Nepal take place before a child’s first birthday, with 64 percent occurring during the first month of life.Along with trained human resources, infrastructures and quality services, deaths of neonates are also linked to the antenatal care visit of pregnant women, access to health facilities, timely referral system and others, experts say. The government has been taking various measures to reduce neonatal deaths, including planning to set up a ‘special newborn care unit’ in all district hospitals throughout the country. For that, concerned agencies under the health ministry have imparted training to all doctors, nurses and paramedics serving in Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok and Makawanpur district hospitals.Special newborn care units are general units designed to care for newborn children who fall ill shortly after birth. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics monitor ailing children admitted to the unit.The health ministry has installed an underfloor heating system at birthing centres in four mountain districts to curb postpartum and neonatal deaths there.Underfloor heating is a form of central heating that ensures indoor climate control for thermal comfort. It uses an electrical heating cable installed underneath the flooring.Hypothermia, infection, low birth weight, premature birth, and abnormal birth asphyxia are among the leading causes of neonatal deaths, doctors say.Some of the programmes being undertaken to lower child mortality include newborn care, kangaroo care, exclusive breastfeeding, infection prevention, chlorhexidine for umbilical cord care, and free neonatal care. “Whatever the achievements we made so far were achieved by the measures taken as of now,” said Upreti. “The ongoing programme may not achieve further progress. Government must implement the programmes and plans to prevent more deaths.” ","summary":"The 16th five-year periodic plan, proposed by the National Planning Commission, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from the existing 21 in every 1,000 live births.

Most health facilities having birthing centres lack neonatal units, trained human resources, and quality services.“Without ensuring quality services, which require trained human resources and advanced facilities, among others, it is impossible to reduce neonatal deaths,” said Upreti. “The government has made various plans to reduce child deaths—including neonatal deaths—but does not pay much attention to their effective implementation.”The finance ministry’s recent report shows that the institutional delivery rate increased to 80 percent from 79 percent last year. The rise in institutional deliveries has contributed to lessening the maternal mortality rate, which is 151 in every 100,000 live births.“Fifty percent of the neonates die in the first 24 hours of birth,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services. “Most of our health facilities, including birthing centres, lack proper infrastructures.”Study shows that 85 percent of all deaths among children under the age of five in Nepal take place before a child’s first birthday, with 64 percent occurring during the first month of life.Along with trained human resources, infrastructures and quality services, deaths of neonates are also linked to the antenatal care visit of pregnant women, access to health facilities, timely referral system and others, experts say. The government has been taking various measures to reduce neonatal deaths, including planning to set up a ‘special newborn care unit’ in all district hospitals throughout the country. For that, concerned agencies under the health ministry have imparted training to all doctors, nurses and paramedics serving in Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok and Makawanpur district hospitals.Special newborn care units are general units designed to care for newborn children who fall ill shortly after birth. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics monitor ailing children admitted to the unit.The health ministry has installed an underfloor heating system at birthing centres in four mountain districts to curb postpartum and neonatal deaths there.Underfloor heating is a form of central heating that ensures indoor climate control for thermal comfort. It uses an electrical heating cable installed underneath the flooring.Hypothermia, infection, low birth weight, premature birth, and abnormal birth asphyxia are among the leading causes of neonatal deaths, doctors say.Some of the programmes being undertaken to lower child mortality include newborn care, kangaroo care, exclusive breastfeeding, infection prevention, chlorhexidine for umbilical cord care, and free neonatal care. “Whatever the achievements we made so far were achieved by the measures taken as of now,” said Upreti. “The ongoing programme may not achieve further progress. Government must implement the programmes and plans to prevent more deaths.” "},{"hash":"a7b5818bf95b1ee9a3be5479469154731eb69650d4a341be9cab956b5280aec4","title":"government-sets-aside-a-meagre-4-6-percent-of-the-annual-budget-for-the-health-sector","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/health/2024/05/29/government-sets-aside-a-meagre-4-6-percent-of-the-annual-budget-for-the-health-sector","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/thumb4-1716946067.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1716940800000,"source":"kp","category":"health","content":"The government has allocated Rs86.24 billion to the health sector for the upcoming fiscal year, around a 2.5 percent increase from the 83.99 billion allocated for the current fiscal year.The new allocation is only around 4.6 percent of the total budget.Funds have been allocated to give continuity to most of the ongoing programmes—safe motherhood programmes, free essential medicines, setting up basic health care centres in all wards throughout the country, and financial relief to people from difficult and expensive diseases—cardiovascular disease, cancer, renal failure, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, head and spinal injury, sickle cell anaemia, and stroke. The health budget also includes grants to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Nepal Police Hospital, Nepal Army Hospital, Civil Hospital, and others. The national budget has announced a few new programmes, including the establishment of the Sita Dahal Memorial College of Naturopathy and Yogic Science under Kathmandu University. Sita Dahal is the late wife of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who died in July last year. Health experts said that the incumbent government neglected the health sector this year, too, as a slight increase in the annual budget does not help to continue the existing health programme.“How can we achieve the Sustainable Development Goals targets from the budget allocated to the health care sectors?” said Mahendra Prasad Shrestha, former chief specialist at the Ministry of Health and Population. “We need to bring qualitative change, and for that, huge investments are required.”Several healthcare programmes, including safe motherhood programmes, child health programmes, tuberculosis control, nutrition, vector control programmes, epidemic control, non-communicable diseases, and mental health programmes, have already been affected by the cut in the previous year’s budget.Likewise, the budget doesn't address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases.Non-communicable diseases—such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and chronic lung disease—have emerged as major public health problems of late, accounting for 71 percent of deaths in the country.A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases, which primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption, biological risk factors, raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes—found non-communicable diseases have emerged as a major killer.Nepal has witnessed several outbreaks in recent years—dengue, cholera diarrheal diseases, and other vector-borne diseases. The country has failed to achieve the malaria elimination target.“Every hour, one person commits suicide, the burden of non-communicable diseases has increased alarmingly, and neonatal deaths have not declined in the past several years,” said Shrestha. “Several programmes of health, including a free screening of cervical cancer and renal problems in the state-run health facilities, could not be implemented due to various reasons. The budget allocated for health even does not support continuing the ongoing programmes.”Experts caution that budgetary cuts in crucial healthcare programmes would have a long-term impact and could affect the achievements made over the years.“The government has not allocated the health budget to strengthen the federal structures,” said Dr Padam Bahadur Chand, former chief of the Policy Planning and International Cooperation Division at the Ministry of Health. “Most of the health budget will be spent on the salaries of the staffers.” ","summary":"The government has allocated Rs86.24 billion to the health sector for the upcoming fiscal year, around a 2.5 percent increase from the 83.99 billion allocated for the current fiscal year.The new allocation is only around 4.6 percent of the total budget.Funds have been allocated to give continuity to most of the ongoing programmes—safe motherhood programmes, free essential medicines, setting up basic health care centres in all wards throughout the country, and financial relief to people from difficult and expensive diseases—cardiovascular disease, cancer, renal failure, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, head and spinal injury, sickle cell anaemia, and stroke.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley "},{"hash":"c077b34beda2250a997231f215f178053a057340c5c72de0aec15b25ae40ddb7","title":"old-memories-and-new-realities-in-phidim","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/travel/2023/11/18/old-memories-and-new-realities-in-phidim","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2023/third-party/phidim%20main%20(1).JPG&w=900&height=601","date":1700265600000,"source":"kp","category":"travel","content":"Once again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift.

Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend.

She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances.

This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities.

Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects.

Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation.

During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time.

It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides.

Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides.

They have never qualified for the 50-over Cricket World Cup and are the least experienced side in the group.They are heading into the World Cup following a series of disappointing results, including the ACC Men’s T20 Premier Cup debacle and a heavy 63-run warm-up defeat against Canada.Inconsistencies with the bat have been one of their biggest headaches so far.Openers Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh have failed to live up to the billing lately, resulting in a failure to give the team a good start. Three years ago, on April 17, 2021, when the duo fearlessly put on a record-breaking 116-run opening stand against the Netherlands in their T20I debut in Kirtipur during the Nepal Tri-Nation T20I Series, the impression was that Nepal had finally found the missing piece of their top batting order.However, questions have been raised over their form as the opening duo has failed to build any impressive partnership recently, especially this year.Bhurtel—despite being one of the three Nepali batters alongside Paudel and Dipendra Singh Airee to have crossed 1,000 T20I runs—is experiencing the worst year of his career and is showing no signs of improvement. In his last four T20I innings, he was dismissed for three ducks in a row during the Premier Cup, and for 10 runs against Canada during the World Cup warm-up. In between, he played knocks of 16, 2, 1 and 13 against West Indies A.Shiekh has also been unsteady with the bat. He scored a fifty against West Indies A and 22 against Canada in the World Cup warm-up but failed to cross double-digit figures in his previous four outings.Nepal’s batting display will heavily rely on skipper Paudel, who usually bats at number three, and big-hitter finisher Airee.Paudel is the most consistent batter in the Nepal squad. He is at his prime and entering the World Cup having scored 265 runs in his four innings that included a century and two half-centuries against West Indies A.Allrounder Airee holds the record for fastest T20I fifty. More recently, he entered the elite club when he smashed six sixes in an over against Qatar during the T20I Premier Cup, becoming the only third man to do so after Yuvraj Singh in 2007 and Keiron Pollard in 2021.Airee will certainly be the trump card of Nepal’s batting order at the World Cup.Kushal Malla, whose 34-ball hundred against Mongolia is the second fastest T20I century, is also expected to kindle fireworks.Nepal’s bowling unit will be another key strength at the World Cup, as they demonstrated in the warm-up game against Canada. They proved effective in the middle overs and struck five times in the space of 27 deliveries to limit Canada from 111-2 in the 14th over to 135-7 in the 18th over.All-rounder Sompal Kami—the only player from Nepal’s 2014 World Cup squad to feature in the 2024 edition—will bring hordes of experience in the bowling department and will lead the fast bowling alongside cult hero Karan KC, who is the highest wicket-taker in Nepal’s squad with 90 wickets from 68 innings.Lalit Rajbanshi will lead the spin threat alongside Sagar Dhakal, who is proving his worth by taking seven wickets in his last four matches.However, all eyes will be on Abinash Bohara, who will be crucial for Nepal at the back end of the innings as the majority of his wickets have come in the death overs. Since making his debut in 2019, Bohara has taken 74 wickets from 56 innings, which is the third highest for Nepal.Nepal will still be the heavy underdogs in the group, especially against 2014 world champions Sri Lanka and 2009 and 2014 semi-finalists South Africa. This will be the first time Nepal will face Sri Lanka and South Africa. Paudel, who is the youngest captain in the United States and the West Indies among the 20 participating nations, believes Nepal can do well at the World Cup. “I have faith in my team. They will give their best, be it in opening batting or other departments,” said Paudel, who added that the role of openers would be important. “It is upon the opening batters to get the team off to a good start,” he added.“In T20 cricket, no team is really a favourite. The Netherlands defeated Sri Lanka in the warm-up game. The United States beat Bangladesh twice for a historic 2-1 series victory. That’s why I believe we can and we will [compete].”If Nepal are to build momentum for the Super Eight stage, they will need to overcome their first hurdle against familiar foes Netherlands, who are making their fifth appearance at the T20 World Cup. But it will not be an easy task against the tricky Dutch, who are on the verge of completing a hat-trick of wins against the Proteas after defeating them in the 2022 T20 World Cup and the 2023 Cricket World Cup.“Our team is focused on the Netherlands match because it is very important for us to win that game and carry the thrust to the following matches. Our players are also well aware of their respective roles,” Paudel added.Nepal can also present a thrilling challenge to a Bangladesh team, who are reeling after hitting a new low after losing a series against inexperienced and tournament debutants, the US. The Tigers also lost to Zimbabwe by eight wickets in a T20I series earlier this month.This will be the second meeting between Nepal and Bangladesh. In fact, Bangladesh defeated Nepal by eight wickets in the group stage of the 2014 World Cup and progressed into the second round. The Bangladeshis have never made it to the knockout stages across eight editions of the tournament. ","summary":"Nepal will aim to impress at the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in the United States and the West Indies when they launch their campaign against the Netherlands at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Tuesday.Drawn in Group D, the Rhinos will play their next group matches against Sri Lanka in Florida on June 12, followed by clashes against South Africa on June 15 and against Bangladesh on June 17 in the Caribbean.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) ","summary":"Nepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright.

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  ","summary":"Gyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while.

Just shy of two years before the newspaper’s launch in 1993, Deuba had assumed public office, having been elected to Parliament during the general elections of May 1991 and appointed as Minister for Home Affairs by then PM Girija Prasad Koirala, his mentor. In its 31 years of existence, marked by unprecedented headlines ranging from democratic upheavals to the Maoist uprising to an emergency, Kantipur has found in Deuba, as it has in many other leaders, a reliable political newsmaker.For the context here, Deuba’s comments were in reference to the arrest of Kailash Sirohiya, chairman of Kantipur Media Group (KMG), publisher of Kantipur and this very paper. On May 21, Sirohiya was arrested for allegedly misusing his citizenship certificate, an act seen as vindictive and instigated by Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane in retaliation for Kantipur's extensive coverage of his alleged involvement in cooperative frauds.Thapa cited Deuba’s disapproval of the government controlling the media for the content they publish, regardless of how one feels about the veracity of the content. Deuba suggested there were other legitimate ways to respond. Thapa urged for a defense of press freedom, asserting that the “intimacy” between democracy and a free press is so deep as to be easily severed.For clarification, my interest in this article is not about assigning blame in the allegations against Sirohiya or Lamichhane—the due process of law should handle that. What intrigued me as a student of news practices was Deuba’s claim about the unequivocal nature and coverage he has received in Kantipur over the years and his call to scrutinise it closely, as well as Thapa's assertion regarding the nature of the relationship between journalism and our form of body politic.Pride and prejudiceThe problem is that Dahal, himself a competing newsmaker, is not a scholar as to be able to execute such a gigantic reading project that will require a longitudinal research undertaking. Besides, he is not the right person for the job because of the potential ethical risks he may invite as well as the self-reporting biases he might bring to the study. Reviled, criticised, hounded mean different things to different people. Unfortunately, this has remained a task cut out even for independent, specialised researchers in short supply. Politicians are often too sweeping, grandiloquent or presumptuous in their statements, and media mostly recycle them, amplifying the rhetoric by way of attributions. Our media and politicians are benign adversaries, always ready to question the other side. But Deuba and Thapa unwittingly help provoke a set of significant questions that touch on the issue of bias, the core of hostility—or even intimacy—between the media and political figures. On professional grounds emphasising transparency or truth-seeking, media often take pride in holding those in power to account, with hard-hitting reportage, hence the saying, “Without fear or favour”. Politicians, on the other hand, are seen as often taking pride in smooth talk, control and denial. Prejudices follow. Bias by numbersIdentifying bias, which cannot be confirmed in a single news story but requires studying the massive volume of coverage over time for a persistent pattern of favouritism, is easier said than done. A few election monitoring reports provide the closest empirical evidence on media bias regarding individual leaders or their parties. While they provide some indications, such studies are anomalies since they don’t reflect the continuing trends on the ground. Think tanks, often donor-driven, mostly focus on development, governance, restructuring and other social issues. There is a widespread perception that political reporting has prioritised personalities over issues and noise over sense, favouring certain figures or entities over others. Individual-focused studies in research have investigated media portrayals of characters ranging from Prashant Tamang to Yarsagunbu; however, in a country fixated on politics and politicians, figures like Deuba, Oli, or Dahal curiously do not feature anywhere in the scope of researchers.Media journals are still emerging. Insights from Samaaj Adhyayan, the erstwhile Media Adhyayan journal, reveal a diverse range of topics have been covered, including press freedom, media regulation, political transformation, inclusion, broadcasting policies, information technology, arts and culture, language, literacy, health and environment, labour rights, digital transformation, to name a few. Since 2016, the journal has shifted focus to other societal issues, most notably education. Academic journals, such as Bodhi, have also contributed to research discourse on media, focusing more on theory, pedagogy and rhetoric and less on journalistic practices. Many studies rely on anecdotal evidence or case studies, seldom using robust data and rigorous methods. Consequently, confirming bias allegations against political figures or entities remains elusive. The nature and extent of media bias against the monarchy, especially after years of support for a constitutional monarchy and democracy and against the Maoists during the prolonged conflict, haven’t been conclusively established. At the moment, our politicians and even the media themselves could only wish that some independent entity or scholar of standing would help answer just how deep and wide bias runs when it comes to covering individual political figures. It's no longer important to cry foul over media bias. Take it to the next level; examine its true nature, extent and methods. In this age of propaganda and widespread manipulation of public opinion, a meaningful reading should be based on big data from across platforms, not just Kantipur, and led by researchers, statisticians and engineers. In other words, we need to reflect on reason and rhyme—the ideal balance between rigour and creativity—to assess and guide both sides to live up to their ideals.

Would the University Grant Commission be interested in commissioning such an exciting project?  "},{"hash":"32ab39e9fe7540b97c00dda95d318c5ec26785bd14dd4b4fb5ada03727f0eb05","title":"poetic-ecology-of-nepal-mandala","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/06/07/poetic-ecology-of-nepal-mandala","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/leadshutterstock-1717768223.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1717718400000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"This article attempts to discuss the ecology of the Kathmandu Valley by alluding to poetry, heritage, culturally important architectonic sites and the visions of an important visionary. Poets of yesteryear have praised the Valley’s pristine ecology, which is now losing that state. I begin with some examples of poetic expressions. Poet Bhanubhakta Acharya (1814-66), after a few days' walk from his home village Tanahun, entered Kathmandu through Balaju, which struck him as a paradise. He composed a poem in praise of the place like this: \"I saw Balaju today after so many days/ and writing this verse knowing that this is a paradise on earth./ Birds swing on the vines around./ Oh how they draw the mind/ through their sweet melodies\". Poet Laxmi Prasad Devkota (1909-59) has written a brilliant onomatopoetic melody titled \"Sundarijal\", an unprecedented poetic consonance with ecology. I advise the ecologists to read that poem loudly in groups. Devkota also speaks eloquently about the pristine ecological position of the Kathmandu Valley. We can imagine the then-open landscape covered by dense cities today. The poet describes this section of Kantipur in his poem Sharad or Autumn. He describes the angelic rice fields teeming with \"thatched cottages, golden houses… and flowers that opened with poetic abandon. … I feel I hear the water babbling in sleep.\" And he writes, \"If you carefully listen to that you can hear the very flow of the sweet melody of the moon\". That has all changed beyond recognition today. Preserving the pristine ecology of a space where you have chosen to make a capital city is impossible. Poet Siddhicharan Shrestha (1912-92) wrote a famous poem about an eagle serenading in the sky—Antarikshyama chila karayo. These are a few examples that I have cited from my memory and translated. Poets of the later times picture the city as modern, like any other city. There is a difference between the true picture of the ecology of Kathmandu and the emulation of Western avant-gardist drifts. However, I must mention here that the ecology of Nepal Mandala, which is captured in the tangible and intangible heritage, is still there. Very few ecologists have turned their attention to this matter. Though the tangible forms of such heritage are getting lost, we can see a unique blend of the dynamics of the ecology of the Nepal Valley and the tangible heritage sites. I have taken a few examples in the following section. Kathmandu’s ecology is not an isolated phenomenon. It is a part of global and regional climate change and the pervasive impact of such metamorphosis. Climate seminars, academic sessions and media are full of such tautologies. But our responses to the ecological changes that occur in Kathmandu emanate from our deep anxieties about the sweeping changes in the environmental condition of the valley. What gets commonly left out in the expressions is the significant narrative about the poetic creation of the arts and architecture of the Nepal Valley. People from fields of culture and literature discuss this subject; they raise concerns about the damage that the cultural artefacts and the architectonic formations have suffered. Some native and foreign writers have studied the relationship between the intangible cultural forms that abound in the valley. The title of a book written by an Austrian architect and scholar named Carl Pruscha reflects on the environmental concerns with cultural heritage. The title is Kathmandu Valley: The Preservation of Physical Environment and Cultural Heritage. What strikes me about this tome is its rich illustrative presentation of the relationship between cultural heritage and environment. He shows the relationship between the degradation of the physical environment and the structures. This book, when it was published in 1975, surprised people with its comprehensive index of the sites and monuments which were constructed in the Kathmandu Valley. Pruscha has classified and identified 34 monument zones, 32 preservation districts and 29 \"natural preservation districts.\" He has also identified 888 individual monuments and sites. Thanks to architect Biresh Shah, I attended the 88-year-old Pruscha's discourse given online to people he knew on May 31, 2024, at Taragaon that he had designed. I want to recall here my article \"Pruscha's Kathmandu Valley\" (The Kathmandu Post, June 12, 2016).I want to write about the ecology of the Nepal Mandala. Some important works like Gautam Vajracharya's Hanumandhoka Rajdarbar (2033 BS), Sudarshan Raj Tiwari's The Ancient Settlements of the Kathmandu Valley (2011) and Niels Gutschow's Newar Architecture (2011) need close reading. The book by an American scholar, Mary Slusser (1918-2017), who has presented a unique picture of the ecology of this space by blending nature and culture is worth mentioning. Like many others, this scholar whom I personally knew very well, has written a book titled Nepal Mandala (1982, 1998). Her oeuvre has evoked various responses from both the natives and the non-natives. Mary's Nepal Mandala makes an eloquent study of ecology by brilliantly blending heritage, arts and people.I want to recall another visceral interpretation of the poetic ecology of the Kathmandu Valley made by Dr Sanduk Ruit, the famous ophthalmologist who, according to Google reports, \"was involved in restoring the sight of over 180,000 people across Africa and Asia.\" He is giving continuity to this activity. Dr Ruit once told me he had never seen such an ecologically friendly place as Kathmandu. He says the Kathmandu ecology has drawn people here and helped them create cultural civilisations and feel comfortable. I remember one other example he gave then. He said Kathmandu does not let you feel extremely exasperated and miserable regarding the ecological condition. If you are feeling terrible on a sultry day in Kathmandu Valley, all you have to do is wait until the cloud forms and a heavy or light rain pours down. Dr Ruit evoked the poetic and benevolent nature of the ecology of the Valley that remained home to great eco-cultural times. His perception or vision is poetic, human and aesthetic. But it is not complex; it is simple and approachable. I was struck by the poetic ebullience and trust of nature of the eye surgeon and humanist Dr Ruit. He restores people's visions to see that world and not remain in the dark. The scenes of women and men grinning from ear to ear in joy after Ruit restores vision to them have become a happy feature. That's why perhaps he is called “the god of eyesight”.Lastly, the reality. Kathmandu has to face ecological challenges like other good places. We should face that with poetry, vision and humanism.  ","summary":"This article attempts to discuss the ecology of the Kathmandu Valley by alluding to poetry, heritage, culturally important architectonic sites and the visions of an important visionary.

The elections have not only reshaped the landscape of Indian politics but also highlighted the evolving nature of voter behaviour, coalition politics and regional influences. This piece delves into the key aspects of the elections, examining the performance of major political parties, the role of coalition partners, the resurgence of the Indian National Congress (INC) and the implications for future governance.BJP: Dominant yet challengedThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, emerged as the single largest party in the 2024 elections but fell short of securing a majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament. The BJP secured 240 seats, a significant drop from the 303 seats it held in the previous term. This shortfall underscores a shift in voter sentiment. It presents challenges for the party as it seeks to form a stable government with the help of its coalition partners in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).The BJP's performance in key states like Uttar Pradesh (UP), Maharashtra and West Bengal was particularly telling. Despite strong pre-election predictions and robust campaigning, the party experienced setbacks in these crucial states, which play a pivotal role in determining the overall outcome of national elections. The loss of significant seats in these regions indicates the limitations of a centrally driven campaign and highlights the importance of addressing state-specific issues and dynamics.Coalition dynamicsThe reliance on coalition partners has become increasingly apparent for the BJP. The return of key allies such as Janata Dal (United) [JDU] and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) to the NDA fold reflects the necessity of strategic alliances in the current political scenario. Both the JDU and the TDP had previously exited the coalition but were brought back into the fold as the BJP recognised the need for additional support to secure a majority.The demands from coalition partners for significant cabinet positions, such as Home Ministry for the JDU and Speaker for the TDP, highlight the high stakes involved in these alliances. The coalition partners' leverage underscores their strategic importance and the need for the BJP to carefully manage these relationships to ensure a cohesive and stable government. The negotiations and compromises required in this context are indicative of the complex dynamics that underpin coalition politics in India.Resurgent CongressOne notable outcome of the 2024 elections has been the resurgence of the Indian National Congress (INC). The Congress increased its seat count to 99, significantly improving from the 52 seats it held in the previous term. This resurgence is attributed to a focused campaign strategy that emphasised social justice themes, caste mobilisation and economic inequality. Rahul Gandhi, the Congress leader, maintained a consistent message that resonated with various voter demographics, particularly in rural and Dalit constituencies.The Congress's ability to secure the position of opposition leader marks a significant recovery and positions the party as a formidable force in the opposition. Its success in mobilising support through a well-coordinated campaign and strategic alliances with other opposition parties reflects a shift in voter sentiment and a demand for an alternative to the BJP's narrative.INDIAThe INDIA alliance, comprising various opposition parties, demonstrated surprising traction despite lacking a single leader or a common platform. This alliance coordinated effectively and presented a united front, even with internal differences and challenges. The focus on regional issues and local alliances played a crucial role in their electoral gains, as evidenced by the understanding between the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Punjab.INDIA alliance's ability to gain significant ground despite being outspent and facing various obstacles, such as arrests and frozen bank accounts, underscores the importance of coalition politics in India. The alliance's success in mobilising voters and presenting a credible alternative to the BJP highlights the potential for opposition parties to challenge the dominant narrative and influence the political discourse.Regional dynamics The 2024 elections reinforced the complexity of regional dynamics in Indian politics. States like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and West Bengal played pivotal roles in shaping the overall outcome. The BJP's underperformance in these states, despite strong pre-election predictions, indicates the limitations of national campaigns and the importance of state-specific strategies.In Uttar Pradesh, for example, the NDA won only 37 of the state's 80 seats. Various factors contributed to this outcome, including local anti-incumbency, strategic candidate nominations and effective opposition alliances. The election results in Maharashtra and West Bengal also highlighted the significance of regional dynamics, with local issues and alliances playing crucial roles in determining voter behaviour.Hindutva and identity politicsThe BJP's strategy of leveraging Hindutva and divisive identity politics appeared to have limited success in this election. High-profile speeches and inflammatory rhetoric by BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Modi, did not translate into expected electoral gains in key constituencies like Ayodhya and Banswara. This outcome suggests a possible voter fatigue with polarising narratives and a demand for governance focused on development and economic issues.The mixed outcome of identity politics indicates the evolving nature of voter behaviour in India. While such strategies have proven effective in the past, their limited success in the 2024 elections suggests a growing demand for inclusive governance and a focus on substantive issues that impact the everyday lives of voters.The path forwardAs the BJP prepares to form a new government on June 8, the challenges of navigating coalition politics and addressing diverse regional expectations will be paramount. The necessity for a \"grand federal bargain\" and the accommodation of various regional interests will be crucial for maintaining stability and ensuring effective governance.The upcoming state elections in Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand will serve as further litmus tests for the BJP's strategies and coalition management. The ability to secure victories in these states will significantly influence the power dynamics within the NDA and impact the broader political landscape.The ruling party's ability to address regional aspirations, manage coalition dynamics, and focus on inclusive development will shape the future governance landscape in India. The 2024 elections have underscored the importance of strategic alliances, the evolving nature of voter behaviour, and the need for a governance approach that transcends polarising narratives and addresses the substantive issues facing the nation.

As the results poured in, Modi addressed the public in a televised speech in which he termed the NDA’s victory a “historic feat”. Modi also used the opportunity to list out what he called achievements of his 10-year stint as the prime minister—poverty alleviation, employment generation, economic growth, and so on. But his gait during the speech, and the spirit of the BJP leaders appearing on talk shows on television channels close to the BJP, suggested something was amiss. After months of pompously claiming that the NDA would cross the 400-seat mark in the 543-strong parliament, Modi was finally coming back to reality with a humble 293 seats, while the BJP’s own tally was 240, well below the 272 mark for a majority. Even more distressing for Modi was that the opposition alliance, INDIA, secured 230 seats, a feat even the opposition parties themselves had not expected considering the BJP’s hubris in the run-up to the elections. This was certainly a humbling moment for Modi. An important message the Indian electorate has given Modi, the BJP and the NDA is that there is only so much you can gain from the politics of religion. Coming on the heels of a massive campaign to “reinstate” Lord Ram in Ayodhya, the election was seen as a referendum on Modi’s Hindutva politics. The results have shown that the Indian citizens are not as excited as Modi and his partyfolk about the idea of establishing a “Ram Rajya”. Anti-incumbency aside, the falling numbers—the BJP got 303 seats, and the NDA 353 seats in the 2019 parliamentary elections—are a tell-tale sign of the voters’ dissatisfaction with where India is headed as the living conditions of most people remained largely unchanged amid growing economic disparities. Another humbling prospect for Modi is having to share the stage with N Chandrababu Naidu of Andhra Pradesh and Nitish Kumar of Bihar. The fact that the opposition alliance is now strong enough to lure Naidu and Nitish into their camp—especially with Nitish earning the nickname “Paltu Babu” owing to his history of changing alliances—must have come as a hard truth for Modi, who has wielded a strong hand over governance during his two terms. This could mean that India is headed back to the days of coalition raj, much like in the nineties when small political parties that had emerged from the fringes came to the mainstream and played kingmakers, thus destabilising governments much like in present-day Nepal. How a humbled Modi will negotiate the terms of coalition politics will be for us to see in the coming days. But what the Indian electorate has proven, through the world’s largest electoral machinery, is that democracy is a daily plebiscite. No matter how fool-proof an image you build of yourself as an invincible leader on the back of a subservient media, there is a community of silent voters waiting for the right moment to make a course correction. That the Indian electorate has shattered the prospect of establishing a ‘one party state’ in the globe’s largest democracy will also give heart to those fighting for democratic rights everywhere in the world.  ","summary":"The National Democratic Alliance, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, has clinched a victory for the third consecutive term in the Indian parliamentary elections, paving the way for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to continue his hold on power. As the results poured in, Modi addressed the public in a televised speech in which he termed the NDA’s victory a “historic feat”. Modi also used the opportunity to list out what he called achievements of his 10-year stint as the prime minister—poverty alleviation, employment generation, economic growth, and so on. But his gait during the speech, and the spirit of the BJP leaders appearing on talk shows on television channels close to the BJP, suggested something was amiss. After months of pompously claiming that the NDA would cross the 400-seat mark in the 543-strong parliament, Modi was finally coming back to reality with a humble 293 seats, while the BJP’s own tally was 240, well below the 272 mark for a majority.

These farmers have asked for nothing more than the amount (around Rs5 billion) owed to them by private dairy companies since last August. For the same reason, the dairy farmers were compelled to spill milk in a March protest before reaching an agreement with three private dairy companies, the state-owned Dairy Development Cooperation (DDC) and the Ministry of Agriculture, to clear the payments by April 3. But all their effort went in vain, prompting them to plan yet another protest if their dues were not settled in the next two weeks.The plight of dairy farmers suggests utter neglect of this vital sector. Be it vegetable producers, sugarcane growers or dairy farmers, inadequate plans and policies to address their demands have left the farmers struggling. Reduced income has hit all aspects of the economy, and consumers are unable to buy dairy products. Even the sweltering heat, which would usually boost the demand for dairy products, has failed to do so. The government’s failure to address the core problem of the economy has had a significant impact on consumers and has spilled over to farmers.Market insiders have noted that the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government, without conducting proper market study, hiked the price of milk in March last year: Rs9.1 per litre in the minimum purchase price of raw milk paid to farmers, bringing the price up to Rs65.5. Following that, in the same month, DDC also set the price of half-litre milk at Rs48.50, by raising Rs5.50. However, this price is still high in Nepali market, leading many to import from the southern neighbour India. As a result, while Nepal produces over six million litres of milk a day with roughly 300,000 homes contributing, between 500,000 and 600,000 million litres go unsold due to the lack of market, as per the government’s economic survey (2023-24). The dairy farmers thus got no benefit from the price hike. The dairy companies, citing the economic crisis, don’t appear to have taken significant steps to solve this problem. They claim that their capacity to store butter is already exhausted, and they haven’t been able to buy milk and pay the farmers. During vital periods like these, the companies should have adequate storage systems to retain dairy products for high-demand times like Dashain and Tihar, explore international markets, and find new ways to attract consumers at home through quality dairy products. Additionally, the Central Dairy Cooperative Association—a key player in knocking the doors of the government to pay the rightful amount to the farmers—is yet to finalise measures to clear outstanding dues. It is not known why the government and private dairy companies haven’t settled the issue. Farmers who end up throwing milk on roads but fail to understand the demand-supply fluctuation are also to blame. Cooperatives and government authorities should work together to educate and encourage farmers to adopt agricultural insurance schemes, which cover 80 percent of the government subsidy. As an immediate measure, it is the state’s prime duty to pay attention to the farmers’ woes. Clearing the outstanding dues of Rs5 billion shouldn’t be much of a hassle considering that the sector contributes around five percent to the country’s gross domestic product.  ","summary":"Nepal’s dairy farmers are facing renewed hardships with the government repeatedly failing to heed them.

Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces.

The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement.

During her four-day visit, she interacted with people from all walks of life, including the prime minister, in an attempt to gauge the human rights situation here. In this interview with Binod Ghimire of the Post, Callamard talked about the human rights situation in Nepal and the rest of the world. Excerpts: You have been travelling this part of the world, interacting with people. How do you evaluate the human rights situation here?Human rights are backsliding everywhere. It’s a global phenomenon. There is backsliding on civil and political rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is backsliding on women’s rights and non-discrimination on economic rights, and in terms of armed conflicts. The number of people dying in armed conflicts is increasing exponentially. We are in deep trouble as far as human rights protection is concerned. The South Asia region hasn’t been immune to the global trend.For my mission, I am visiting Sri Lanka and Nepal. In the two countries, we observe the shrinking of civic space and greater weaponisation of laws to curtail freedom of expression, particularly online. The digital laws are often overbroad and disproportionate. Banning TikTok in Nepal, for instance, is a disproportionate overbroad measure of the violation of international laws. We are observing a great deal of attacks in protests. The use of lethal force or disproportionate use of force by the police in response to even peaceful protests is increasing. There are incidents where protestors have died after the use of police force. There are issues of impunity for past crimes. A study by a European research centre shows that fewer people live in democracies worldwide in 2024 than in 1986. This is a complete U-turn. What do you see as the reasons for the backsliding? There are several factors that explain the backsliding. One could be growing restlessness and anxiety due to economic downturns. There was a severe financial crisis in 2008, and we didn't really recover from it. The inequalities within states and between states have increased in the last decade. We have seen a sharp increase in the wealth of the super-rich. On the other hand, the poor are getting poorer. This is feeding anger and creating fertile ground for populism. The authoritarian leaders are feeding on that particular ground. The backsliding is also linked to Covid that had a terrible impact on the economy and society. During Covid, the governments adopted different emergency measures but, in many cases, those measures were never lifted. In Europe, refugees, migrants and minorities are viewed as the reasons why the economy is not picking up and they are accused of stealing jobs. In every country, the minorities have been made the scapegoats. There is a resentment that democracy has not delivered for the people. The expectations are high, but the governments have failed to act accordingly. Therefore, the people are prepared to listen to the authoritarian leaders. By authoritarian leaders, I do not mean those who are in power by force but those who are democratically elected. They are elected by the people, but they practise authoritarianism once they get into power. In Nepal, the burning problem of authoritarianism has been reflected even in local politics. For instance, the mayor of Kathmandu has resorted to repeated attacks against street vendors and landless people. These are authoritarian moves. Such leaders target vulnerable groups who cannot protect themselves. You are in Nepal at a time the government has arrested the owner of the largest media house. How does Amnesty International look at this situation?We are very alarmed and upset. We call on the government to release him immediately. Even if the charges are valid, they certainly do not justify imprisoning him. Amnesty International believes that the use of those charges is politically motivated and is an attempt to stifle dissent. It is a response to the professional investigation and reporting about the policies and practices of those in power. This is an attempt to silence him, to silence the news media and to silence journalists. By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights.We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority.Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated?Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected.We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology.Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesn’t stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Do you think other countries should follow the European Union’s footsteps?Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings.Why do you think Nepal’s transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward?Sadly, the transitional justice process hasn’t progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. That’s the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice.You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutors’ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire. This is nonsense.Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. In fact, peace is not sustainable without justice. When justice is not delivered, the conflict is bound to recur. It is just a matter of time. We often hear the excuse that if a particular leader or a person is prosecuted, that would affect peace. On the contrary, not investigating the perpetrator is a real challenge to peace. Many people who are in power after a peace deal themselves are guilty of war crimes. They don’t want to be held accountable. It is not in their interest to deliver transitional justice. It takes an incredible, highly moral and principled leadership to take the process ahead.We have seen here that the transitional justice process has been paralysed. Successive governments have failed to act on the Comprehensive Peace Accord. They haven’t acted on what the Supreme Court told them in 2015. It had directed them to review, revise and reform the Transitional Justice Act.Here I have seen the categorisation of crimes as serious and non-serious, which is very strange. It is shocking to me that some killings are considered non-serious, and could lead to de facto amnesty for those responsible for them, even though these crimes fall under international law. If someone was killed after torture then two crimes have been committed—torture and killing. Right to life is the most important right. The investigation should be done accordingly. The same is the case with sexual violence with rape and without rape.What is alarming is that people are losing trust. If people do not trust the systems that are supposed to deliver justice, that will cause a big problem. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons couldn’t undertake proper investigation and prosecution. Not all have received the government’s relief, which has led to much frustration and animosity. There is political interference on transitional justice, which also lacks independence and transparency.We are calling on the authorities to act as directed by the Supreme Court, ratify the statute on the International Criminal Court as well as the International Convention on Disappearance. Do you see chances of international interference if Nepal continues to delay justice delivery?There is no doubt that some crimes committed during the war fall within universal jurisdiction. If the perpetrators of those crimes travel to countries where a framework of universal jurisdiction has been enacted, they could be arrested there. We are seeing the multiplication of universal jurisdiction cases in Europe.Cases of custodial deaths, torture and extrajudicial killings are common in Nepal. How can they be checked?Different organisations like Amnesty International should be monitoring the abuse of power by the police and state authorities. There must be impartial and fair investigation of such incidents. But there is a regime of impunity. The police are not very keen to investigate themselves. I wanted to mention the case of Ajit Mijar, which is an example of justice being denied. It also shows the complicity of the institution in denying justice.Nepal is ranked the fourth most vulnerable country due to climate change though it contributes negligibly in greenhouse gas emissions. The largest polluters haven't fulfilled their responsibilities towards Nepal. How can organisations like Amnesty advocate for countries like Nepal?Amnesty International has long been advocating for climate justice. We have a set of demands. We are advocating at the United Nations level and also at the COP. We are pushing through COP our message of loss and damage, about the responsibilities of industrialised countries to cut their reliance on fossil fuel industries and so on. The impact of global warming will lead to loss of lives in places like Nepal and Pacific Islands.We saw very timid steps taken in COP in UAE last year. These steps are far from sufficient. We see countries multiplying their investments in fossil fuel while big fossil fuel companies are also violating their written commitment to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. This is alarming.However, we have made some progress on loss and damage. Governments are recognising the principle of loss and damage for the countries that are least responsible for climate change. They can rely on some kind of global financial system to protect and support them in case of a sudden climate related crisis. We are now advocating for the responsible countries to set aside the necessary funds.Nepal is at the receiving end of climate change though the country is not responsible for it. However, the Nepali government also has a responsibility towards its people. The extreme weather risk faced by Nepal demands urgent acts from the authorities. The most vulnerable communities are at particular risk. The government must have instruments to protect them.  ","summary":"Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard was in Nepal last week as a part of her first South Asian tour.

By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights.We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority.Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated?Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected.We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology.Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesn’t stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Do you think other countries should follow the European Union’s footsteps?Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings.Why do you think Nepal’s transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward?Sadly, the transitional justice process hasn’t progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. That’s the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice.You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutors’ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire. This is nonsense.Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. In fact, peace is not sustainable without justice. When justice is not delivered, the conflict is bound to recur. It is just a matter of time. We often hear the excuse that if a particular leader or a person is prosecuted, that would affect peace. On the contrary, not investigating the perpetrator is a real challenge to peace. Many people who are in power after a peace deal themselves are guilty of war crimes. They don’t want to be held accountable. It is not in their interest to deliver transitional justice. It takes an incredible, highly moral and principled leadership to take the process ahead.We have seen here that the transitional justice process has been paralysed. Successive governments have failed to act on the Comprehensive Peace Accord. They haven’t acted on what the Supreme Court told them in 2015. It had directed them to review, revise and reform the Transitional Justice Act.Here I have seen the categorisation of crimes as serious and non-serious, which is very strange. It is shocking to me that some killings are considered non-serious, and could lead to de facto amnesty for those responsible for them, even though these crimes fall under international law. If someone was killed after torture then two crimes have been committed—torture and killing. Right to life is the most important right. The investigation should be done accordingly. The same is the case with sexual violence with rape and without rape.What is alarming is that people are losing trust. If people do not trust the systems that are supposed to deliver justice, that will cause a big problem. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons couldn’t undertake proper investigation and prosecution. Not all have received the government’s relief, which has led to much frustration and animosity. There is political interference on transitional justice, which also lacks independence and transparency.We are calling on the authorities to act as directed by the Supreme Court, ratify the statute on the International Criminal Court as well as the International Convention on Disappearance. Do you see chances of international interference if Nepal continues to delay justice delivery?There is no doubt that some crimes committed during the war fall within universal jurisdiction. If the perpetrators of those crimes travel to countries where a framework of universal jurisdiction has been enacted, they could be arrested there. We are seeing the multiplication of universal jurisdiction cases in Europe.Cases of custodial deaths, torture and extrajudicial killings are common in Nepal. How can they be checked?Different organisations like Amnesty International should be monitoring the abuse of power by the police and state authorities. There must be impartial and fair investigation of such incidents. But there is a regime of impunity. The police are not very keen to investigate themselves. I wanted to mention the case of Ajit Mijar, which is an example of justice being denied. It also shows the complicity of the institution in denying justice.Nepal is ranked the fourth most vulnerable country due to climate change though it contributes negligibly in greenhouse gas emissions. The largest polluters haven't fulfilled their responsibilities towards Nepal. How can organisations like Amnesty advocate for countries like Nepal?Amnesty International has long been advocating for climate justice. We have a set of demands. We are advocating at the United Nations level and also at the COP. We are pushing through COP our message of loss and damage, about the responsibilities of industrialised countries to cut their reliance on fossil fuel industries and so on. The impact of global warming will lead to loss of lives in places like Nepal and Pacific Islands.We saw very timid steps taken in COP in UAE last year. These steps are far from sufficient. We see countries multiplying their investments in fossil fuel while big fossil fuel companies are also violating their written commitment to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. This is alarming.However, we have made some progress on loss and damage. Governments are recognising the principle of loss and damage for the countries that are least responsible for climate change. They can rely on some kind of global financial system to protect and support them in case of a sudden climate related crisis. We are now advocating for the responsible countries to set aside the necessary funds.Nepal is at the receiving end of climate change though the country is not responsible for it. However, the Nepali government also has a responsibility towards its people. The extreme weather risk faced by Nepal demands urgent acts from the authorities. The most vulnerable communities are at particular risk. The government must have instruments to protect them.  "},{"hash":"3f032051d0a2e55ade7bafb8356409bb34776169f26650f7ccc2c83b1a7cfec0","title":"if-oli-continues-to-manoeuvre-there-might-be-other-coalitions","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/05/19/if-oli-continues-to-manoeuvre-there-might-be-other-coalitions","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2019/interviews/interview01-1716183251.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1716076800000,"source":"kp","category":"interviews","content":"The CPN (Unified Socialist), which was fashioned in 2021 by a splinter faction of the CPN-UML, is preparing to hold its first general convention.

Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer?Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation. After Oli’s election as the party leader, policy issues were undermined. In fact, we were at odds because of the policy issues.What were those policy disputes?We [our faction] believed that after the establishment of democratic republic system, the fight for a political system was almost over as this is the most progressive political system of our time. We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party. The new party was confused about the way forward. The upcoming general convention will formulate clear policies in this connection. What about the leadership? Will the party get new leadership?For the past two decades, I have been advocating that a communist party should adopt the right programmes to bring about social changes. At the time, the Maoists had a policy of seizing state power through force, and the UML was talking only about transforming society through elections. But the UML was basically engaged only in winning elections. In this context, we [a group of UML leaders] came up with some policies that would make substantive changes in such ritualistic practices.Now, I have been saying that our party should be led by a leader who can internalise and effectively implement those policies. We have almost finalised the party’s policy documents.

Party representatives will debate and decide this at the convention.A large number of senior leaders quit the UML to form this party. But it couldn’t even retain its members let alone further expand.There was a need for radical reforms and restructuring in communist organisations and their policies. This should have been done by the country’s largest communist party—the CPN-UML. But the party leadership and its rank and file didn’t realise the need for it. There was no serious policy discussion in the UML. While the leadership of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and its organisation are oriented in the right direction, it’s not properly trained for such restructuring. Therefore, many even accused the party leadership of being just a follower and subservient to the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre. Various sections of society who had praised us for standing against Oli’s wrong decision didn’t appreciate other political moves of our party. Parliament dissolution was a political event. A party needs clear programmes and agenda to keep public support. Unfortunately, we were found wanting in this regard. We should have done something in job creation and increasing production. We will make such things clear at the upcoming convention. Since its formation, the party has been constantly bickered over power sharing with other parties and even party leaders always seem to be wrangling for ministerial berths. Don’t you think such activities weaken the party?This happened as the party lacked clear policies to move ahead.

Nepal seems closer to the Congress while Khanal has been consistently lobbying for an alliance with the UML and the Maoist Centre.We have almost resolved this issue in the course of finalising the party’s policy document. Our conclusion is that, in general, the Congress mainly represents neoliberals and comprador capitalists. When we lobby for the country’s independent economic policy, the Congress may not agree. The party tilts more towards pro-western ideas in the name of liberalism. We in our party are in consensus that in the long-run we will compete against the Congress. But we shouldn’t forget that we got the current democratic system and the constitution only after fighting jointly with the Congress.

How do you prove your relevance?The CPN-UML didn’t follow the right policies, even those endorsed by its general conventions. Party chief Oli wants total control of the party organisation, from the centre to the local units. The entire party is mobilised mainly to realise Oli’s personal ambitions.

Such a merger is guided mainly by the interests of certain leaders. That’s why the merger didn’t last. The need now is unification among communist parties based on policies and programmes. Otherwise, it will be nothing more than a gathering of leaders.

Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   ","summary":"United Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal Hanaa Singer-Hamdy has worked for close to 30 years across development and humanitarian contexts in senior management and strategic leadership roles. Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities.

Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council?

Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   "},{"hash":"a6caead0fcd8ed7f359179455ee5ce107dd1b3ea6c2626bf980eeb748fe585eb","title":"today-s-weather-june-11-2024","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/weather/2024/06/11/today-s-weather-june-11-2024","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/a34a4381f03d4ab68fd0f3e254ac6627-1717030542.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1718064000000,"source":"kp","category":"weather","content":"The weather will be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country today.Koshi, Bagmati and Gandaki will experience partly to generally cloudy weather while the rest of the country will be partly cloudy to mainly fair, the Meteorological Forecasting Division said.Light to moderate rain with thunder, lightning and gusty wind is likely to occur at a few places of Koshi Province and hilly regions of Bagmati and Gandaki provinces.

Snakebite incidents and resulting deaths are also common during the season but the phenomenon, which experts dub “a lurking invisible crisis”, remains grossly neglected.

Experts say changes in rainfall patterns, which have become severe and erratic in the past few years as an impact of climate change, have contributed to extreme weather events like floods and landslides annually.
