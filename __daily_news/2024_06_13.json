I am confident that its successful implementation will serve as a significant milestone in Nepal's women's health sector, said Pradeep Yadav, Hon’ble Minister of Health and Population.\nObstetric Fistula is a hole between the birth canal and bladder or rectum or both, caused by prolonged, obstructed labor without access to timely, quality medical treatment. It often leads to chronic health problems, depression, social isolation and deepening poverty. Ninety per cent of fistula cases result in stillbirths.\nUNFPA has been a longstanding partner of the Government of Nepal in the campaign to end fistula. The agency has supported awareness-raising programs, provided free surgeries, and strengthened the capacity of healthcare providers.\n\"UNFPA is committed to working with the government and partners to accelerate progress towards ending fistula by 2030 in Nepal,\" said Won Young Hong, Representative for UNFPA Nepal. \"We urge all stakeholders to redouble their efforts to ensure that no woman is left behind.\"\nTo expand access to advanced fistula repair surgeries, UNFPA Nepal together with the Ministry of Health and Population will establish a fistula treatment center at the Paropkar Maternity Hospital. The center will provide state-of-the-art care for women with fistula, through a referral network with other hospitals across the country.\nUNFPA pledges its continued support to the government in implementing the roadmap, including through a district-by-district elimination campaign focusing on prevention, case management, and rehabilitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"hash":"8bfa419360b048b7c7ad3ba581531a1db6a9ea7d86d74b0d1197959a0eb1c76a","title":"dengue-cases-found-in-57-districts","date":1716508800000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/health/dengue-cases-found-in-57-districts","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/kushtia_dengue_6yr_old_child_dies_of_dengue_in_kushtia_daily_bangladesh_16941828191697183214_1024.jpg","category":"health","content":"\nWith the start of rainfall, cases of dengue have started increasing.

It is happening\", President Paudel said.\nStating that he thinks that it is playing a positive role in the economic sector of Nepal through electricity trade by ending the dependency situation in the past, he expressed the opinion that it is a matter of satisfaction that Nepal can contribute to the increase in the use of renewable energy through the export of clean and green energy to the regional markets of neighboring countries.\n\n"},{"hash":"8645e6e32c99e132c7dedb2a85a2626985e9d5f7e0c18cf2f27997f5d483ec41","title":"draft-bill-on-it-and-cyber-security-seeks-transparent-accountable-use-of-ai","date":1710201600000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/science-and-technology/draft-bill-on-it-and-cyber-security-seeks-transparent-accountable-use-of-ai","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/Ministry_of_Communication1710223162_1024.jpg","category":"science-and-technology","content":"\n A draft bill designed to manage IT and cyber security has underlined the use of innovative technology.

The 8,201-metre peak was first scaled in winter from the southeast pillar. The caravan route was Kathmandu-Lukla-Namce-Gokyo and Cho Oyu base camp.After three years, in May 1987, Ang Phuri Sherpa became the first Nepali to reach the peak from the Nepal side. It was in spring. Then a group of Russian climbers summited the peak in the autumn of 1991, followed by two Japanese in 1994.The last time Cho Oyu was conquered was in the spring of 2009, when Denis Urubko and Boris Dedeshko of Kazakhstan reached its top. After a decade and a half, a seven-member Sherpa team, including a French national, reached the summit last week. Cho Oyu is considered one of the most accessible 8,000ers from the Chinese side, while the Nepal side is considered among the toughest.Only 21 people have reached Cho Oyu from Nepal’s side in the past 70 years. By contrast, more than 4,000 have successfully climbed the mountain from the Tibetan side. This makes Cho Oyo the second most climbed eight-thousander after Everest.Among the 8,000ers, Cho Oyu has the lowest death rate.On June 7, the French Alasdair McKenzie, with Gelje, Tenging Gyaljen and other sherpas, stood atop Cho Oyu at 8:35 pm via the southwest ridge. The caravan route was Kathmandu-Lukla-Namche-Thame and Cho Oyu base camp.Unlike past expeditions, last week’s climb was meant to prepare a permanent route for a commercial expedition from the Nepal side.“With this success, Cho Oyu has become more accessible from Nepal, heralding a new era in Nepali mountaineering and inspiring future expeditions to tackle its challenging routes,” said Mingma Sherpa, chairman of Seven Summit Treks, the agency which explored the local route. Nepal boasts of eight of the 14 highest peaks over 8,000m on the planet. They are Everest, Kanchenjunga, Lhotse, Makalu, Dhaulagiri, Manaslu, Cho Oyu and Annapurna. But to climb Cho Oyu, climbers usually had to go to Tibet first.“From now onwards, commercial expeditions will happen from the Nepal side. This is good news for all expedition agencies. Climbers will no longer need to go through a long process of getting permission from the Tibetan authority. All eight mountains above 8,000 are now accessible from the Nepal side,” said Mingma.Last Friday, the team started the summit push at 2:00 am from Camp IV, and after a relentless effort of over 18 hours, they made it to the top. “This remarkable achievement was the result of a meticulously planned expedition that started in March and commenced in the first week of May from Lukla,” said Mingma.According to Mingma, a commercial expedition on Cho Oyu may last 60 days and could cost a foreigner between $25,000 and $30,000.“That’s obviously a welcome development. It will create more jobs on the mountain,” said Ang Tshering Sherpa, former president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association. “But it’s too early to say whether the route will be a commercial success,” he said. For instance, the operating cost incurred from the Nepali side is nearly double that from the Tibetan side, in addition to the challenges a vertical wall poses.Transporting goods from Kathmandu to the Cho Oyu base camp would cost $5 per kg. However, as the road reaches the advanced base camp or camp above the base camp of Cho Oyu from the Tibetan side, the cost on that route would be $2 per kg.“There is a lot of difference in the operating costs. Climbing from the Tibetan side would cost $13,000 a person,” said Ang Tshering Sherpa. “So, obviously, the climber's preference would be the Tibetan side. First due to the lower factor, and, second, it’s an easier climb from the north.”The success of the new route will depend on its commercial feasibility.Mingma said Cho Oyu’s Nepal side is known for its steep, vertical walls rising thousands of metres, making it one of the greatest present-day challenges. He, however, said once the route becomes commercial, competition will bring down the cost.“More than that, foreigners do not need to wait weeks or even months for the Tibetan authority’s permit to climb.”The story of the first expedition, from the Tibetan side, however, is more interesting.According to the archive of Nepal Tourism Board, the country’s tourism promotional body, Cho Oyu was first chosen for an expedition in 1952 in preparation for an Everest ascent the following year.The first attempt of Cho Oyu from the Tibetan side was made by a British party led by Eric Shipton, with Edmund Hillary, George Lowe, Charles Evans, and Tom Bourdilon as its members. However, technical difficulties at an ice cliff above 6,650m forced them to give up the climb.According to the archive, the expedition, led by the British Eric Shipton, was estimated to take two weeks. “It would also mean entering the Tibetan territory, which it is believed Shipton was unwilling to do,” according to the archive.It was Shipton who first measured Cho Oyu as the sixth-highest mountain in the world.An Austrian expedition, led by Herbert Tichy, arrived in Birgunj in 1954 via India and flew into Kathmandu on an Indian airliner of the time. Once they were packed and ready, they moved to Bhaktapur, from where the long trek to the mountain would begin.There were only three foreign climbers and eleven sherpas on the team.Cho Oyu was finally climbed on October 19, 1954, via the northwest ridge in Tibet by Tichy, Joseph Jöchler and Pasang Dawa Lama.Before Cho Oyu, Everest and Annapurna in Nepal, and Nanga Parbat in Pakistan had been climbed.

Nepal boasts of eight of the 14 highest peaks over 8,000m on the planet. They are Everest, Kanchenjunga, Lhotse, Makalu, Dhaulagiri, Manaslu, Cho Oyu and Annapurna. But to climb Cho Oyu, climbers usually had to go to Tibet first.“From now onwards, commercial expeditions will happen from the Nepal side. This is good news for all expedition agencies. Climbers will no longer need to go through a long process of getting permission from the Tibetan authority. All eight mountains above 8,000 are now accessible from the Nepal side,” said Mingma.Last Friday, the team started the summit push at 2:00 am from Camp IV, and after a relentless effort of over 18 hours, they made it to the top. “This remarkable achievement was the result of a meticulously planned expedition that started in March and commenced in the first week of May from Lukla,” said Mingma.According to Mingma, a commercial expedition on Cho Oyu may last 60 days and could cost a foreigner between $25,000 and $30,000.“That’s obviously a welcome development. It will create more jobs on the mountain,” said Ang Tshering Sherpa, former president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association. “But it’s too early to say whether the route will be a commercial success,” he said. For instance, the operating cost incurred from the Nepali side is nearly double that from the Tibetan side, in addition to the challenges a vertical wall poses.Transporting goods from Kathmandu to the Cho Oyu base camp would cost $5 per kg. However, as the road reaches the advanced base camp or camp above the base camp of Cho Oyu from the Tibetan side, the cost on that route would be $2 per kg.“There is a lot of difference in the operating costs. Climbing from the Tibetan side would cost $13,000 a person,” said Ang Tshering Sherpa. “So, obviously, the climber's preference would be the Tibetan side. First due to the lower factor, and, second, it’s an easier climb from the north.”The success of the new route will depend on its commercial feasibility.Mingma said Cho Oyu’s Nepal side is known for its steep, vertical walls rising thousands of metres, making it one of the greatest present-day challenges. He, however, said once the route becomes commercial, competition will bring down the cost.“More than that, foreigners do not need to wait weeks or even months for the Tibetan authority’s permit to climb.”The story of the first expedition, from the Tibetan side, however, is more interesting.According to the archive of Nepal Tourism Board, the country’s tourism promotional body, Cho Oyu was first chosen for an expedition in 1952 in preparation for an Everest ascent the following year.The first attempt of Cho Oyu from the Tibetan side was made by a British party led by Eric Shipton, with Edmund Hillary, George Lowe, Charles Evans, and Tom Bourdilon as its members. However, technical difficulties at an ice cliff above 6,650m forced them to give up the climb.According to the archive, the expedition, led by the British Eric Shipton, was estimated to take two weeks. “It would also mean entering the Tibetan territory, which it is believed Shipton was unwilling to do,” according to the archive.It was Shipton who first measured Cho Oyu as the sixth-highest mountain in the world.An Austrian expedition, led by Herbert Tichy, arrived in Birgunj in 1954 via India and flew into Kathmandu on an Indian airliner of the time. Once they were packed and ready, they moved to Bhaktapur, from where the long trek to the mountain would begin.There were only three foreign climbers and eleven sherpas on the team.Cho Oyu was finally climbed on October 19, 1954, via the northwest ridge in Tibet by Tichy, Joseph Jöchler and Pasang Dawa Lama.Before Cho Oyu, Everest and Annapurna in Nepal, and Nanga Parbat in Pakistan had been climbed.

However, the districts of Koshi province have been spared from this scorching weather.Several weather stations, including those at Changunarayan Bhaktapur, Chautara of Sindhupalchok, Tikapur of Kailali, Dharan of Sunsari, and Sarlahi, broke all previous records of maximum temperatures this year.Temperatures exceeding 33 degrees Celsius over the past several days have made life difficult in the Kathmandu valley, with many residents complaining about the heat.On Wednesday, the temperature climbed to 34.3 degrees Celsius in Kathmandu. Met officials said that hot and dry conditions will continue for the next couple of days, as monsoon rains are not expected to arrive in the Valley anytime soon.“Monsoon rain is a must for the Valley to cool down, but it is unlikely to arrive in the next two days,” said Pratibha Manandhar, a senior meteorologist at the Meteorological Forecasting Division. “Temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius for several days have made the Valley hotter.”According to the Met Department data, the weather station at Changunarayan in Bhaktapur recorded 34.4 degrees Celsius on May 31, the highest temperature ever recorded here. Kathmandu had recorded 36.6 degrees Celsius on May 7, 1989. Tikapur of Kailali recorded 45.2 degrees Celsius on May 30, the highest temperature in the country this year. Likewise, Dharan recorded 40 degrees Celsius on April 28, and Sarlahi recorded 43 degrees Celsius; both are the highest temperatures recorded for those places, according to the Met department.Monsoon clouds entered the country from eastern Nepal on Monday, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Since then, districts of eastern Nepal have been witnessing rainfall. Met officials say it used to take two days for the monsoon clouds to arrive in the Valley after their arrival in eastern Nepal and around a week to spread throughout the country. However, last year, it took some three weeks for rainfall to occur in western and far-western Nepal.“Due to climate change, the weather has become more unpredictable,” said Manandhar. “The monsoon that entered eastern Nepal two days ago should have reached the Valley by Wednesday, but it may take a few more days.”The Met Office issued a heat wave warning for western and farwestern Tarai following the onset of monsoon. Officials said that they may have to issue more such warnings in the coming days due to the slow progression of the monsoon towards the western parts of the country.“It is not possible to come out in the afternoon due to the extreme heatwave conditions,” Dr Sanket Kumar Risal, information officer at Bheri Hospital in Nepalgunj, told the Post over the phone. “The hospital is also packed with patients suffering from fever and water-borne diseases. Even groundwater sources are shrinking in our areas. It now takes several hours for the water tank to fill up, which previously took just an hour.” On Wednesday Dhangadhi recorded 43.9 degrees Celsius, followed by Nepalgunj (42.2°C), Birendranagar (41.1 °C), Bhairahawa (40.4 °C), Ghorahi (39.5°C), and Dipayal (40.8 °C). The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on September 23. Last year, it started on June 14, one day later than the normal onset day. A normal monsoon, supported by the timely arrival of rain, translates into favourable agricultural production, mainly of paddy, and is further linked with the country’s overall economic growth.The monsoon season, which delivers around 80 percent of the country’s total annual rainfall, generally lasts 105 days. But, in recent years, it has been taking more time to withdraw.The Met Office has forecast above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures this monsoon, which could unleash extreme weather events, such as flooding, inundation, and landslides.The department’s climate section has forecast weather conditions for four months (June to September). It said most parts of the country are likely to experience above-average minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall due to weakened El Nino conditions, and the development of La Nina conditions.El Nino conditions are the climatic patterns in which the surface water warms, unusually.The opposite, the cooling of the ocean surface, happens in the La Nina conditions.Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests the maximum temperature in Nepal is rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average of a rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year.Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short time, continuous rain for several days post-monsoon, dry spells and droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal temperatures in winter—have become more frequent in Nepal. ","summary":"Nepal has been experiencing extreme heat in most districts, reaching up to 45 degrees Celsius, with the Koshi province receiving some respite; monsoon rains are delayed, leading to a heat wave warning in western and farwestern Tarai, while the monsoon season is expected to bring above-normal rains and temperatures."},{"hash":"0bc036e78fef5d62f25ba39c569c48e2fa5b2fea6d43db1548ac4e12e1aa6ddd","title":"books-have-been-instrumental-in-my-healing-journey","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/books/2024/06/13/books-have-been-instrumental-in-my-healing-journey","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/booktalkshreya-1718244877.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1718236800000,"source":"kp","category":"books","content":"Candid and confident, Shreeya Giri founded the digital mental health platform Happy Minds.

Each year, as the fiscal year enters the eleventh month, government agencies and contractors wake up from their slumber and pull up their socks to either make payments or work for the payments received. Last-minute capital spending repeats each financial year, exposing the inefficiency with which Nepal’s development sector operates. This model of “development” has a nomenclature of its own—Asarey Vikaas. Thanks to the Asarey Vikas model, the roads that were bumpy until last night would have turned smooth and shiny this morning. Roads often become the sites for the manifestation of such an ill-planned model of development, leaving even the locals who have learnt not to expect anything from the government surprised at the sudden transformation of their roads. After all, the government has money to spend, and contractors have work to finish to claim that money. But such hurried spending has a major problem: The work being done is substandard. The road that was blacktopped overnight to meet the spending deadline of this financial year will hardly last until the end of the next financial year. Between June 10 and July 15, 2020, the capital spending jumped by 17 percent in the last month of the fiscal year as the government rushed to increase such expenditure. Before the rush, the capital expenditure had been just 30 percent in the first 11 months of that fiscal year. In FY 2020/21, the government spent 21 percent of the total budget in a single month, between mid-June and mid-July. As of June 12, a little over a month before the end of FY 2023/24, capital expenditure was a mere 44 percent, which means that the government has failed to spend the budget allocated, making it difficult to meet the development targets. Experts blame bureaucratic red tape for the delay in capital expenditure, as it takes months for even small amounts of bills to be cleared. Moreover, projects are often initiated randomly without ensuring the financial resources, leading to failure to move them forward. Previous governments tried to address the problem through budget implementation guidelines. Last year, the government made it mandatory to complete the call for bids and contract signing of projects by mid-November and begin work within 15 days of the signing. It said the plans and programmes that failed to meet this deadline would not get any budget. The 81-point budget implementation guideline has specific provisions on project completion timeline, payment, budget transfers and other matters of financial discipline. The government cannot maintain a lacklustre attitude when it comes to capital expenditure, as it has a detrimental effect on the country’s overall development. It is time to streamline the monitoring, evaluation and payment systems to ensure that the government’s plans and programmes move forward and are completed within the stipulated deadline. The last-minute spending rush should become a thing of the past—which will also be a solid proof of the government’s commitment to improving people’s lives through judicious spending.  ","summary":"Torrential rains often signal the onset of the early monsoon month of Asar.

However, due to high costs, over half a million Nepalis are deprived of primary healthcare. The country has 7,221 public health facilities, including 125 hospitals, 205 primary health care centres, 395 ayurvedic hospitals, 3,870 health posts and 2,626 community health centres and private health institutions. Despite this wide healthcare structure, the system still struggles to provide accessible and affordable healthcare services to the entire population. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that poverty increases by 2 percent every year due to high out-of-pocket expenditure (OOP) on health services from the private sector. In Nepal, the OOP constitutes 57.7 percent of the current health expenditure, while the government’s share is only 22.6 percent. Nepal has introduced schemes such as the Social Security Fund, the Employee Provident Fund, and the National Health Insurance Programme (NHIP), as well as enterprise private insurance, free healthcare, conditional cash transfer programmes, and improvised citizen programmes to reduce OOP and improve accessibility. However, the effectiveness of these schemes still remains in question. An appropriate pre-financing mechanism is needed to reduce the uncertainty of health illness and the catastrophic cost associated with healthcare. Nepal Government introduced the National Insurance Programme in 2016 to comply with the constitution and work towards achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030, a vital aspect of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). UHC ensures access to quality healthcare without financial hardships. The target of SDG8 has two indicators: Coverage of essential healthcare services and financial protection for all. Low insurance coverageThe NHIP was designed to offer quality care at a minimal cost, guided by legal and policy frameworks to achieve the UHC. It was initially piloted in three districts—Kailali, Baglung and Illam. Despite a favourable policy environment, coverage and retention are not up to the mark, with only 23 percent enrollment and a significant dropout of 25 percent, which is a serious concern. Coverage is uneven, with Koshi province achieving 42 percent coverage while Madhesh lags at 8 percent. The programme also inadequately covers only 26 out of 77 districts of ultra-poor citizens. Although the NHIP aims to cover the nationwide population by 2030, numerous challenges lie ahead.The NHIP faces several barriers, including epidemiological and geographical limitations, limited risk pooling, stagnant financing, lack of financial sustainability assessment, difficulty in seeking referral services, inadequate local-level empanelment of health facilities, limited digitalisation of the NHIP functions and insufficient government ownership. To improve the NHIP and move towards universal healthcare, Nepal can learn about successful health insurance programmes of other countries. Lessons from elsewhereEvery country has a different insurance system to achieve universal healthcare goals. Japan uses a single-payer system where the government is the sole payer for healthcare services. By centralising the payment through the government, Japan has control over healthcare costs and maintains high standards of care. It is designed to provide universal health coverage and ensure accessibility of healthcare services to all people. Singapore uses a hybrid system where individual responsibility is balanced with government support. This approach aims to provide comprehensive coverage while maintaining sustainability and encouraging accountability in healthcare expenditures. Rwanda’s community-based health insurance programme mandates participation, particularly targeting rural and poor populations. The premium rates are progressive, i.e., based on income levels, ensuring the poorer individual pays less. Thailand has significantly improved health insurance coverage through contributions from civil servants and voluntary participation from those in the informal sector. Civil servants contribute to the system as part of their employment benefits, and for those in the informal sector, voluntary schemes are available, encouraging broader participation. This mixed approach helps to expand coverage and promotes universal health coverage. The United Kingdom has a publicly funded health system that provides medical services to the entire population regardless of socioeconomic status. Nepal can learn from the benefits of a tax-funded system, which offers preventive, promotive and curative health coverage. RecommendationsThe provision of health insurance is in its early stages in Nepal, so revising the benefits package to make it more comprehensive and focusing on enrolling underserved populations in Karnali, Sudurpaschim and Madhesh is essential. Instituting mobile clinics, community-based initiatives and strategic infrastructure development can help overcome geographical barriers and provide equitable healthcare services. Developing a sustainability roadmap, exploring innovative financing mechanisms and increasing healthcare spending should be emphasised to meet international benchmarks. Digitalising NHIP activities can improve efficiency, transparency and service delivery. National surveys to determine the coverage gap are vital in assessing the drop-out rate and increasing sustainability. Strengthening the NHIP is crucial for Nepal’s goal of achieving universal health care. Addressing the identified challenges and implementing proposed recommendations can enhance the NHIP’s effectiveness, ensuring equitable access to quality healthcare. Addressing disparities in health outcomes and financing mechanisms is also crucial to improving overall population health and ensuring everyone has access to quality healthcare. Improving worker training and supervision and prioritising service provider education, quality assurance, and preventive care could strengthen NHIP care. Enhancing rural healthcare accessibility is also necessary for health insurance. The government has increased the budget for the insurance programme, but its share of total health sector spending remains low compared to international benchmarks. The World Health Organization predicts that allocating 5 to 6 percent of GDP or 10 percent of the national budget towards healthcare will effectively cap out-of-pocket expenses. Despite this, Nepal consistently allocates below 5 percent of its national budget to healthcare. Increased funding in the healthcare system should be highly prioritised for the successful implementation of the NHIP.Sustainability issues can be addressed through social health insurance contributions and public-private partnerships. Continuous training and skill development for healthcare personnel can improve the quality of care. Performance-based payments can incentivise healthcare facilities to improve quality and efficiency. Using a mix of different funding methods instead of relying on just one is essential for providing universal healthcare and affordable healthcare services. A national health financing system should ensure every citizen can access healthcare when needed and protect families from financial catastrophe by covering out-of-pocket expenditures. Comprehensive governance and regulatory reform strategies are required to improve the scope, accessibility, quality, and sustainability of national health insurance coverage.  ","summary":"The Constitution of Nepal defines health as a fundamental right, stating that every citizen is entitled to free basic health services.

Long-term exposure to pesticides has also been known to cause cancer and other debilitating conditions in children.In her report published in The Guardian last August, journalist Zofeen T Ebrahim asked, “How many more poor child workers must die in Pakistan before change happens?” It is a good question that has still not been answered almost a year later.In the report, the journalist recounts the death of 10-year-old Fatima Furiro who was found dead in a mansion in Khairpur.

The reason that legislation, whose ostensible purpose is to end child labour and protect our young ones from the kind of brutality inflicted on little Fatima Furiro, is not implemented is because, in this land of inequality, there is no accountability of the wealthy and influential, who are, in fact, given a free pass after every atrocity they commit.

However, due to a changing climate, monsoons in recent times have invariably resulted in more hardship than help. This monsoon, which arrived in Nepal on Monday, three days ahead of the usual date, will certainly buoy farmers and provide much-needed relief from the blistering heat, but concerns over its severity still loom large. Experts have predicted above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures. As this will exacerbate floods, landslides and epidemics, disaster preparedness becomes crucial.Our responses to natural disasters have consistently fallen short. Governments come and go, but the same pattern repeats every year, and hundreds of lives, and a whole lot of properties and physical infrastructure are left at nature’s mercy. Not that the country has no plans and policies for disaster preparedness. This year, as in previous ones, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority has devised the Monsoon Preparedness and Response Plan, which is commendable. The necessary logistics and emergency relief materials have also been stockpiled in all provinces, according to officials. The problem, however, is with the execution of these plans. This monsoon is estimated to put 1.81 million people and 412,000 households at risk, and require 18,000 rescues. These numbers are large, suggesting the necessity for a comprehensive response to disasters and ensuring that relief programmes reach the most vulnerable and needy. Lack of effective coordination between federal, provincial and local levels has also caused several problems during disasters. Local governments play a big role as primary rescuers in floods and landslides, but they are still far short in human and financial resources. The examples from the earthquake-devastated Rukum West, Sindhupalchowk and several other places highlight how Nepal fails to rehabilitate the disaster-displaced people for long periods. The residents of Rukum West are still obliged to live in houses with cracks and fissures, and experts warn that these houses could be badly damaged this monsoon. There is also high risk to those living in high landslide and flood prone areas. Unless we design approaches that include not only immediate relief programmes but also year-round relocation, rehabilitation, monitoring and study, people will continue to suffer. Also, proactive measures like public awareness and early warning should be strengthened.Moreover, monsoons are notorious for water- and vector-borne diseases, including dengue, cholera and typhoid. Dengue cases are already being reported from different parts of the country and the caseload will likely increase during and after the monsoon. Water resource contamination has surged in the past few months, leading to a higher number of water-borne disease cases in hospitals. During the monsoon preparedness, the authorities shouldn’t overlook these epidemics and focus particularly on areas that are more prone to diseases and, therefore, need timely healthcare intervention and workers.A coordinated effort from health, home, urban development and water supply ministries can help make this monsoon a lot safer. In the long run, we should find ways to mitigate the effects of climate change, which has exacerbated our climatic conditions and intensified disasters. Understanding the impact of climate change and human activities on weather will help us better prepare for future monsoons and the disasters that come in their wake.  ","summary":"When it arrives, it can bring both bounty and bane. However, due to a changing climate, monsoons in recent times have invariably resulted in more hardship than help. This monsoon, which arrived in Nepal on Monday, three days ahead of the usual date, will certainly buoy farmers and provide much-needed relief from the blistering heat, but concerns over its severity still loom large. Experts have predicted above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures. As this will exacerbate floods, landslides and epidemics, disaster preparedness becomes crucial.Our responses to natural disasters have consistently fallen short. Governments come and go, but the same pattern repeats every year, and hundreds of lives, and a whole lot of properties and physical infrastructure are left at nature’s mercy. Not that the country has no plans and policies for disaster preparedness. This year, as in previous ones, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority has devised the Monsoon Preparedness and Response Plan, which is commendable. The necessary logistics and emergency relief materials have also been stockpiled in all provinces, according to officials. The problem, however, is with the execution of these plans. This monsoon is estimated to put 1.81 million people and 412,000 households at risk, and require 18,000 rescues. These numbers are large, suggesting the necessity for a comprehensive response to disasters and ensuring that relief programmes reach the most vulnerable and needy. Lack of effective coordination between federal, provincial and local levels has also caused several problems during disasters. Local governments play a big role as primary rescuers in floods and landslides, but they are still far short in human and financial resources. The examples from the earthquake-devastated Rukum West, Sindhupalchowk and several other places highlight how Nepal fails to rehabilitate the disaster-displaced people for long periods. The residents of Rukum West are still obliged to live in houses with cracks and fissures, and experts warn that these houses could be badly damaged this monsoon. There is also high risk to those living in high landslide and flood prone areas. Unless we design approaches that include not only immediate relief programmes but also year-round relocation, rehabilitation, monitoring and study, people will continue to suffer. Also, proactive measures like public awareness and early warning should be strengthened.Moreover, monsoons are notorious for water- and vector-borne diseases, including dengue, cholera and typhoid. Dengue cases are already being reported from different parts of the country and the caseload will likely increase during and after the monsoon. Water resource contamination has surged in the past few months, leading to a higher number of water-borne disease cases in hospitals. During the monsoon preparedness, the authorities shouldn’t overlook these epidemics and focus particularly on areas that are more prone to diseases and, therefore, need timely healthcare intervention and workers.A coordinated effort from health, home, urban development and water supply ministries can help make this monsoon a lot safer. In the long run, we should find ways to mitigate the effects of climate change, which has exacerbated our climatic conditions and intensified disasters. Understanding the impact of climate change and human activities on weather will help us better prepare for future monsoons and the disasters that come in their wake.  "},{"hash":"23d415324e6cf26ea58c110b181d586fc1a56531f0216e5cf0ce1be99d1d2041","title":"from-northwest-to-east-china-parched-and-baking-regions-face-drought","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/world/2024/06/13/from-northwest-to-east-china-parched-and-baking-regions-face-drought","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/world/UKZMXN2DBJP6ZO3ZKCO4ZMPB3I-1718258733.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1718236800000,"source":"kp","category":"world","content":"Weeks of scarce rainfall in parts of China, coupled with sweltering heat, has brought drought to several provinces, prompting alerts and actions from authorities to minimise impacts on agriculture, and water and energy supplies.Temperatures this week are forecast to scale record highs in parts of China as countries across Asia brace themselves for another summer of extreme weather.China's Water Resources Ministry this week launched emergency responses to manage drought on in Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan and Shandong provinces, indicating various regions in the country spanning the northwest to the east are facing parched and scorching conditions.With dwindling precipitation since May in areas around the Yellow River Basin, in combination with the onset of searing temperatures this month, drought is threatening cultivated land that were being prepared to be sown as well as sown crops, Xinhua reported.The harsh weather conditions will feature until the end of next week, with drought expected to worsen, the official media said.In some parts of Hebei, Henan and Shandong provinces, temperatures could reach 44 degrees Celsius (111.2 degrees Fahrenheit), potentially breaking historical records for the month of June, state broadcaster CCTV said.Surface temperatures could hit 70 C in some localities including in Shanxi and Shaanxi, it added.The emergency management ministry has alerted affected regions including northwestern Shaanxi, northern Hebei and Shanxi, eastern Anhui and Shandong as well as central Henan to protect water and food production.China's national forecaster predicted continuous heat wave conditions and warned about the need to prepare for emergency power supplies as well as fire prevention in forest areas, the People's Daily reported.Electricity demand typically soars in high temperatures as people crank up the air-conditioning to stay cool.Rain, not heat, is the threat in southern China.

And the output against Yemen could possibly convince ANFA to trigger another extension in his contract. ANFA had added a three-month extension in Annese’s contract this year.The emergence of Sanjeeb, who only made his international debut in March this year as an 88th minute substitute during a 5-0 qualifiers loss to Bahrain, is even more promising.Sanjeeb, who played full 90 minutes in Nepal’s 3-0 loss against Bahrain before being benched in 4-0 defeat to the UAE, had a hand in both of Nepal’s goals against Yemen in Dammam.Sanjeeb, who replaced star forward Anjan Bista in the front, first pounced on a misplaced back pass from Radhawan Al Hubaishi and bent the ball past Yemen goalkeeper Mohammed Khairalah to score an equaliser in the 22nd minute.Sanjeeb then received a long pass from Chhiring Lama and served it for Karki to head home Nepal’s second goal in the 66th.It was the first international goals for both Sanjeeb and Karki. Karki made his debut for Nepal in September last year during Nepal’s goalless draw with Myanmar. The evening was also memorable for Nepal captain Kiran Kumar Limbu. Playing his 100th international match, the 34-year-old goalkeeper produced a string of stunning saves to keep Yemen at bay till the final moments and helped Nepal earn a point.Even though Nepal failed to reach the third round of the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers and could not directly qualify for the 2027 Asian Cup, they still have a chance to secure their spot in their maiden Asian Cup through Asian Cup Qualification which will be played between March 25, 2025 to March 31, 2026.Top two teams from each nine groups qualified for the third round of 2026 FIFA World Cup and also secured a direct berth to the 2027 AFC Asian Cup.

Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will fly to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in, and the two prime ministers will hold a meeting after the ceremony, according to government officials. A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime minister’s visit to India. It will be a two-day trip, says Rekha Sharma, Minister for Communication and Information Technology. On Wednesday, Modi phoned Prime Minister Dahal and they briefly discussed the upcoming meeting, according to government officials.Modi is set to become the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to serve three constitutive terms. The third term will be different from his first two as he was the prime minister backed by an absolute majority for his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, in the last two terms. This time, Modi has to rely on coalition partners under the banner of the National Democratic Alliance.With Modi entering his third term, will Nepal-India ties change, or will they remain the same? Modi has championed the “Neighborhood First” policy in his dealings with South Asian nations. Modi is the only Indian prime minister who has visited Nepal more than once—in 2014 and 2018, and again in 2022. Thus, he knows all top leaders of Nepal and is fully aware of bilateral issues, having served in the office for a decade.“India’s policy towards Nepal will not change. There is very much consistency in their policy towards Nepal,” said former foreign minister Ramesh Nath Pandey. “Modi will have control over Nepal policy.In the past decade, several Nepali prime ministers have visited India and interacted with Modi. The Indian prime minister is thus fully aware of Nepal’s concerns and interests, as well as India's expectations of Nepal. However, according to Pandey, Nepal has squandered a decade trying to shed the historical baggage and resolve bilateral differences.This time, the BJP’s coalition partner, the Janata Dal (United), hails from the bordering state of Bihar. The JDU has called for a review of India’s controversial Agnipath scheme, under which hundreds of Nepali youths used to be recruited into the Indian Army’s Gorkha regiments. The Nepal government has refused to allow India to recruit its youth under this short-term scheme, arguing that the 1947 agreement between Nepal, India and Britain stipulated full-term service in both the Indian and British Armies, not short-term enlistment.“Prime Minister Modi had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Nepal,” said an Indian government statement on Thursday. During the talks, Prime Minister Dahal congratulated Prime Minister Modi on his historic victory in the recently concluded Indian general elections, according to the statement.The statement said, “Dahal was convinced that, under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India-Nepal relations would continue to strengthen.”Nepal shares deep-rooted cultural and civilizational links with India and remains a special partner in India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, added the statement.Nepal and India have many commonalities and differences that surface from time to time. Issues like boundary disputes, Nepal’s call for scrapping the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950 and drafting a new one, and the submission of the report of the Eminent Persons Group on Nepal-India relations, among others, remain key bottlenecks in the bilateral ties. Once again, Modi has an opportunity to resolve them.Some Indian experts also claimed that although Modi’s new government will include several coalition partners, the policy towards Nepal will fundamentally remain unchanged. But Modi’s new term is full of challenges as he will have to rely on and persuade his alliance partners and this could lead to instability in governance.Ranjit Rae, former Indian ambassador to Nepal, said that India’s foreign policy will remain unchanged in Modi’s third term as there is broad consensus among the parties on key foreign policy issues. “As Nitish Kumar is in the government and Bihar shares a long border with Nepal, Nepal will remain important in the foreign policy architecture,” Rae said. “Primarily, India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy will continue.” On reviewing the Agnipath scheme, Rae said that it would be good if the new government reviewed it. According to the Indian media, there are hard bargains among coalition partners in New Delhi on power-sharing and it remains to be decided which party gets what portfolio.The two key alliance partners, N Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party and Nitish Kumar, both have secular credentials, so a party-centric foreign policy is unlikely to dominate during Modi’s third term, said Nihar Nayak, Research Fellow at the New Delhi-based Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA).According to Nayak, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) could see a revival, and as per the strong demands of Nitish Kumar’s JDU, the Agnipath scheme will also be scrapped.“If the Agnipath scheme is scrapped or reviewed, relations with Nepal will improve. The second thing is that there will be no BJP foreign policy. India’s insecurity in the region will diminish. The call for the restoration of the Hindu state in Nepal is unlikely to crop up as prominently. There will be changes in some aspects of foreign policy as Modi will be compelled to heed his coalition partners,” said Nayak. ","summary":"The caretaker Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, is all set to take the oath of office for the third constitutive term on Sunday evening, with the invited South Asian leaders to witness the ceremony. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will fly to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in, and the two prime ministers will hold a meeting after the ceremony, according to government officials. A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime minister’s visit to India. It will be a two-day trip, says Rekha Sharma, Minister for Communication and Information Technology. On Wednesday, Modi phoned Prime Minister Dahal and they briefly discussed the upcoming meeting, according to government officials.Modi is set to become the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to serve three constitutive terms. The third term will be different from his first two as he was the prime minister backed by an absolute majority for his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, in the last two terms. This time, Modi has to rely on coalition partners under the banner of the National Democratic Alliance.With Modi entering his third term, will Nepal-India ties change, or will they remain the same? Modi has championed the “Neighborhood First” policy in his dealings with South Asian nations. Modi is the only Indian prime minister who has visited Nepal more than once—in 2014 and 2018, and again in 2022. Thus, he knows all top leaders of Nepal and is fully aware of bilateral issues, having served in the office for a decade.“India’s policy towards Nepal will not change. There is very much consistency in their policy towards Nepal,” said former foreign minister Ramesh Nath Pandey. “Modi will have control over Nepal policy.In the past decade, several Nepali prime ministers have visited India and interacted with Modi. The Indian prime minister is thus fully aware of Nepal’s concerns and interests, as well as India's expectations of Nepal. However, according to Pandey, Nepal has squandered a decade trying to shed the historical baggage and resolve bilateral differences.This time, the BJP’s coalition partner, the Janata Dal (United), hails from the bordering state of Bihar. The JDU has called for a review of India’s controversial Agnipath scheme, under which hundreds of Nepali youths used to be recruited into the Indian Army’s Gorkha regiments. The Nepal government has refused to allow India to recruit its youth under this short-term scheme, arguing that the 1947 agreement between Nepal, India and Britain stipulated full-term service in both the Indian and British Armies, not short-term enlistment.“Prime Minister Modi had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Nepal,” said an Indian government statement on Thursday. During the talks, Prime Minister Dahal congratulated Prime Minister Modi on his historic victory in the recently concluded Indian general elections, according to the statement.The statement said, “Dahal was convinced that, under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India-Nepal relations would continue to strengthen.”Nepal shares deep-rooted cultural and civilizational links with India and remains a special partner in India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, added the statement.Nepal and India have many commonalities and differences that surface from time to time. Issues like boundary disputes, Nepal’s call for scrapping the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950 and drafting a new one, and the submission of the report of the Eminent Persons Group on Nepal-India relations, among others, remain key bottlenecks in the bilateral ties.

Even Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah has joined the chorus accusing Oli, who is also the UML chairman, of illegally swapping tea estate land, citing it as a clear case of policy corruption.The criticism from different quarters has put the UML on the defensive. And Oli is unable to hide his annoyance as questions come from all directions. His party is now defending the decision saying that the land swap was based on an amendment to the Land Act effected through a unanimous decision of the federal parliament.“No party opposed the Act’s amendment. The Nepali Congress also did not register any revision to the [amendment] bill. All the parties jointly passed the law,” said Yogesh Bhattarai, claiming it was wrong to accuse Oli and his party on the matter. He went on to say that the parties that helped revise that Act were now pointing fingers at the UML as the revision had been made without their notice.Against his claim, the Nepali Congress had registered amendments to the bill.

Cabinet decisions are deemed to be among such decisions. Even though the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority Act-1991 is silent on what constitutes a policy decision, the Supreme Court in 1996 sought to define it.As per the 1996 verdict issued by then-chief justice Surendra Prasad Singh and justices Keshav Prasad Upadhyaya, Laxman Prasad Aryal, Kedar Nath Upadhyay and Udayaraj Upadhyaya, decisions taken ‘collectively’ by the Cabinet to fulfil promises made in the election manifesto constitute ‘policy decisions’.Nepali politicians have long been spared from prosecution as decisions made in the Cabinet are termed policy decisions. The anti-graft body has directed the government and Parliament to define what constitutes a ‘policy decision’. Anti-corruption activists have also been seeking clarity on the concept for the same reason.The Oli government presented a bill to amend the Land Act in 2019. It was endorsed by both houses of the federal parliament in January 2020. Based on the new law, the Oli government on April 26, 2021 allowed the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate owners to swap 343.19 bighas (1 bigha equals 6,773 square metres) of land occupied by the tea estate. The decision was challenged in the Supreme Court. A constitutional bench of the court revoked the decision ruling it illegal.The opposition started lashing out at Oli and his party after the court verdict and its full text. This was not the first time that Parliament passed the bill unanimously and realised later that the executive had mala fide intent. On December 24, 2018, the government registered a bill in the federal parliament to amend a few laws. It included a proposal to revise the Nepal Trust Act. The bill revising 56 different laws was tabled for deliberations in the House of Representatives on January 1, 2019 and it was endorsed on February 15 unopposed. The National Assembly endorsed it on March 2 that year, before President Bidya Devi Bhandari authenticated it the very next day. However, the issue came to light only when the Oli government decided to lease out the land under the trust to the Yeti Group. Even the lawmakers who had voted for the revision criticised the law, having overlooked the issue during deliberations in the House.Legal experts say such incidents happen when the lawmaking process is not participatory and parliamentarians show little interest in study and deliberations. “The lawmaking process must be participatory right from its drafting process. It must be discussed widely in the House to make sure that it serves a right cause,” said advocate Mohan Acharya. Amid widespread criticism that law-making lacks broad participation, a bill is under consideration in the House to ensure that legislation becomes a more consultative process.“The bill, if passed, will ensure that bills are drafted after proper consultations with all stakeholders. They will be widely discussed before endorsement,” said Devkota. “In federal countries, central governments discuss bills with the provinces before tabling them in Parliament. Had this been done, there would not have been scams like Giri Bandhu.”Besides, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government is creating a mechanism for turning legislation into a more consultative process. Talking to law students on Sunday, Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri said the government was creating a Suggestion Bank to receive feedback on bills. “Such feedback and suggestions will be incorporated in the bills,” he said.

In today’s time, when power has ceased to be a zero-sum game and good leadership is synonymous with collaboration, the traditionally inclined old men clumsily spewing patriarchal narratives make civilised citizens extremely uncomfortable. Political women with independent political personhood have always been problematic to traditional men. Sahana’s grit, Shailaja’s impatience, Binda’s blatant feminism and Sumana’s formidability seem to have threatened those with the traditional bent of mind. At least two generations of strong, opinionated women have been sidelined or ousted because they did not fit into the mould of patriarchal party politics. It almost seems like the traditional men view them as political “shrews” who, like in the famous Shakespearean play The Taming of the Shrew, need to be “tamed”, cut to a size that is desirable to political patriarchy.Until not long ago, the concept of a “good woman” stemmed from feminine subservience and obedience. Women’s personhood was stunted through intense psychological conditioning that can be traced back to the origins of the state and society. A woman was told how her family’s honour rested on her good character. She was introduced to a heavy burden of feminine morality at an early age. With stories being fed about good women versus bad, patriarchy was very successful in grooming girls to grow up to be good women and obedient keepers of their family’s honour. Subservience was the prerequisite to being a good woman. A good woman was anything but defiant, and if by chance she did get tempted to disobey and defy the norms, she paid a hefty price. This “truth” was continuously fed into the feminine psyche, mostly through religious texts and scriptures. These women were duly punished in the ancient scriptures and medieval texts crafted and propagated by men.Vyaas wrote the story of how Draupadi was dragged by her hair and abused publicly because she had made fun of Duryodhana, leading to the great war between the Pandava and Kaurava brothers. Mother Mary was glorified as a virgin, while Mary Magdalene was vilified as a “loose” woman and had to be rescued. Sita’s disobedience tempted Ravana and caused much grief to Lord Ram. Eve disobeyed the Lord and ate the apple only to be the cause of Adam’s banishment. Khadija was a strong woman and a successful merchant before she married the Prophet, but she submitted herself to him and became his first disciple. In addition, the annual celebration of Swasthani Vrata Katha revered the ideal woman in the form of Goma Brahmani, who never protested, tolerated every injustice inflicted against her personhood. The idea of feminine morality has been strongly correlated with women’s socio-cultural subservience, religious conformity, psychological and economic fragility and physical docility. Even in politics, the men in charge prefer women who embody traditional femininity. However, here lies the problem: The idea of moral, subservient women clashes with the essence of equality and freedom propounded by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Women who have learned the freedoms cannot unlearn them. Today, several women in politics are highly qualified, independent, articulate and honest. They live the most painful existence because the unlearning of patriarchal values has already taken place within them, and they have a fully developed sense of personhood, which, however, is repeatedly obliterated by their party men or other political men who still operate by the patriarchal rules. Strong, independent, ethical women are repeatedly denied space in the party’s leadership. Educated, dignified, honest, resolute, independent and opinionated, Shailja Acharya was often ridiculed for her “short temper” and “moods”. In UML’s case, Sahana’s leadership in the inter-party women’s caucus irked her party men. An economist by training, she was more qualified than most men in her party, but her commitment to the larger political sorority was perceived as defiance; therefore, a covert “cutting to size” was practised against her as well. Narratives are created to invalidate women as viable leaders. These days, the “tamings” have become more overt. Binda Pandey, one of the handful of qualified women inside UML, was denied an election ticket, and the insider quickly pointed out that her “attitude” killed her prospects. The same has been the case with Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe, Kamala Panta, Shashi Shrestha, and others. Women’s recruitment, retention and promotions in parties seek obedient, subservient “yes-women” who do not have to be “tamed”. The latest “taming” attempt, however, appears much more menacing than the past. A woman with an ivy-league education, who speaks the global language, wears gender-neutral clothing, questions the old guards about procedural gaps, carries her own bags, drives her own car and has managed to keep herself out of the clout-centric politics so far, must irk the political retainers quite intensely to receive such blatant, overt attacks regarding her personal choices: From her clothing to her life partner. KP Oli has tried dismantling Sumana Shrestha’s political legitimacy and citizenship by calling Nepal her maita. The chauvinism that drips from Oli’s statement is disgustingly archaic, feudal and regressive for a leader of his stature.Bringing Shrestha into the helm of political give-and-take does not seem to have worked; if it had, Oli would not have had to start “taming” her. If she was unapologetically vocal as a member of the opposition, she seems adamant as a minister to fix the portfolio given to her. Maybe it is her “audacity” to fix the system at the ministry that has somehow miffed the old guard like Oli. His recent rants, aimed to paint her as a frivolous, westernised young woman whose political journey is a mere fluke, scream his intense insecurities. If that is indeed the case, then maybe Sumana Shrestha is doing something right, and we need more “shrew” muckrakers like her.  ","summary":"The collective indignity bestowed on political women, from Shailaja Acharya to Sumana Shrestha, by political patriarchs needs immediate redress.

But records show that millions of mobile phones with advanced features have been imported in the past two years.The rollout plan has been revived after the formation of the new government, which, according to insiders, is close to its northern neighbour, China, which has installed and supplied 5G equipment.“We introduced the new frequency policy around four months ago. Under this policy, all frequencies will go into technology neutrality from the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25,” said Paudyal. Technology neutrality allows service providers to use any technology in a given frequency, he said.Currently, there are two telecom service providers operating in the country—Telecom and Ncell.According to the telecom regulator, service providers can introduce 5G technology using existing frequencies or new ones. The authority says it is prepared to provide new frequencies through auction. Nepal Telecom was provided with a 2,600 Mhz frequency for the 5G trial. The authority provided the frequency for a year, and Nepal Telecom conducted an internal trial for around 2-3 months last October. It was said that Nepal Telecom would conduct a trial among the public, but that wasn’t meant to be. The regulator has written to Nepal Telecom to submit a report on the 5G trial.“Once it receives the report, the authority will proceed accordingly,” Paudyal said.While the government said it is ready to introduce 5G technology, the service providers said that since building the 5G ecosystem requires huge investment and as the country’s current economic situation is not so good, the market is not ready for the new mobile technology.It is estimated that service providers need to invest around Rs50-60 billion to implement 5G technology. Both the market and consumers are not ready for the technology, and there are device constraints, too.According to service providers, though mobile phone users’ demands have been growing in Nepal, daily data usage remains very low. Only two out of 10 Nepalis use mobile data regularly, according to Ncell, the private telecom provider.Ncell said in a recent statement that the average monthly data consumption per customer is only 4GB, which is low compared to other neighbouring countries.The telecom service providers are losing money and have outstanding dues due to the reduction in income.When Ncell introduced 4G in 2017, its annual income was Rs58-59 billion, which has now declined to Rs33-35 billion.Similarly, Nepal Telecom’s profit declined to Rs7.8 billion in the last fiscal year from Rs15.01 billion in 2017. According to a report by Cable.co.uk, the mobile data price measured from June to September 2023 is $0.43, or Rs57.38. The average cost of 1GB of data in India is $0.16, $0.12 in Pakistan, $0.23 in Bangladesh, $0.25 in Sri Lanka, $0.71 in Bhutan, and $2.16 in the Maldives. Mobile data prices are expensive in Nepal compared to other South Asian countries.Nepal Telecom concluded the 5G trial in four places in certain mobile sets to check whether the technology supports our network, said Hari Dhakal, spokesperson of Nepal Telecom.“As it requires a huge investment to bring the technology, we need to look at the cost, market readiness, return and other factors. So it will be difficult for us to go to the public immediately and we will not bring it unless we are assured of all the factors.”Jabbor Kayumov, CEO of Ncell, told a recent press meeting that after India, Ncell was looking to make Nepal the first country in South Asia to introduce 5G commercially. “But to get there, we need to take an important first step, and that is we need every Nepali to start using their mobile phones productively which means keeping mobile data always on.”Also, the government needs to create favourable conditions and reform laws to bring the new technology, company insiders say.For instance, a case involving Nepal Telecom and Ncell is under the court’s consideration. The government is forcefully asking telecom service providers to clear the frequency amount before the auction of 2,100 Mhz by bringing retrospective law, insiders say.3G was introduced in Nepal in 2007 and 4G in 2017.After the government announced an ‘economic decade’, digital economy topics are coming to the fore. “For a digital economy, digital transformation is necessary, which in turn calls for 5G technology. This is why the government has prioritised 5G,” Paudyal said. According to the 61st annual report of the Auditor General, Nepal Telecom spent Rs18.43 million for the trial of 5G in the current fiscal year. The audit has suggested that the company needs to be more effective in the implementation of 5G technology. ","summary":"After three years of halt, the much-awaited 5G frequency is set to be auctioned in Nepal.“The telecom regulator is ready to allow 5G frequency, and we are waiting for service providers’ response,” said Pradip Paudyal, deputy director of Nepal Telecommunications Authority.Paudyal, however, didn’t mention the auction date.“We have decided to auction the 5G frequency and are preparing for it,” he said.Paudyal said that to take part in the auction, service providers should clear all the dues they owe to the government.5G, or fifth-generation mobile technology, offers 10 times faster internet speed than its predecessor 4G and supports 10 times more devices per square kilometre.The state-owned phone company has announced several launch dates, but they have always been postponed for no apparent reason.The 5G rollout was originally planned in 2021 but came to an abrupt halt, which insiders said was due to geopolitics.American and Indian embassies’ officials recently told the Post that they were concerned about the Nepal government allowing the Chinese companies to conduct the 5G tests without going through a competitive bidding process.Nepal Telecom has also been saying that there aren’t enough 5G compatible phones in Kathmandu and other cities to warrant launching the new technology. But records show that millions of mobile phones with advanced features have been imported in the past two years.The rollout plan has been revived after the formation of the new government, which, according to insiders, is close to its northern neighbour, China, which has installed and supplied 5G equipment.“We introduced the new frequency policy around four months ago. Under this policy, all frequencies will go into technology neutrality from the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25,” said Paudyal. Technology neutrality allows service providers to use any technology in a given frequency, he said.Currently, there are two telecom service providers operating in the country—Telecom and Ncell.According to the telecom regulator, service providers can introduce 5G technology using existing frequencies or new ones. The authority says it is prepared to provide new frequencies through auction. Nepal Telecom was provided with a 2,600 Mhz frequency for the 5G trial. The authority provided the frequency for a year, and Nepal Telecom conducted an internal trial for around 2-3 months last October. It was said that Nepal Telecom would conduct a trial among the public, but that wasn’t meant to be. The regulator has written to Nepal Telecom to submit a report on the 5G trial.“Once it receives the report, the authority will proceed accordingly,” Paudyal said.While the government said it is ready to introduce 5G technology, the service providers said that since building the 5G ecosystem requires huge investment and as the country’s current economic situation is not so good, the market is not ready for the new mobile technology.It is estimated that service providers need to invest around Rs50-60 billion to implement 5G technology.

With the sweltering heat in Kathmandu, you might think it was the glare of the sun, but it was more about the joyful energy of the ‘Nepal Pride Parade’. The gallery, which is usually adorned with huge canvas frames and majestic pieces of art, with paintings from traditional to abstract, had way smaller photo frames lined up. The photo frames looked too simple, with ordinary pictures.One might have speculated whether the photos were captured by skilled professionals or if they were groundbreaking shots taken by daring photographers or investigative journalists, given that they were intended for an exhibition. However, from a single look, it could be seen that the photos were taken by no experts, just ordinary people. Yet, when one looked at them, they couldn’t take their eyes off them, for these photos captured the everyday lives of rural trans women—a group often forgotten and overlooked because of the dominant mainstream focus on the urban, upper-class LGBTQIA+ community.Blue Diamond Society (BDS), a pioneering organisation advocating for sexual and gender minorities in Nepal, organised a two-day photovoice exhibit titled ‘Sweekar’ from June 8 to June 9 at the Siddhartha Art Gallery, Babermahal Revisited, Kathmandu. This exhibit, coinciding with Pride Month and the Nepal Pride Parade, showcased the stories of rural transgender women from Madhesh Province, Nepal. Through 15-20 compelling photographs, selected and narrated by the women themselves, the exhibit provided a glimpse into their lived experiences and the intersectional stigma they face regarding gender identity and HIV healthcare.According to the organisers, ‘Sweekar’, meaning acceptance, is a multi-prong effort to examine and address the intersectional stigma experienced by trans women living in Madhesh Province. Photovoice, a method designed to spark verbal discussions on significant community issues, has been widely utilised in health education. Fifteen trans women were invited to participate in two three-day photovoice workshops in Janakpur. They worked with a trained facilitator to learn how to use photography to share their lived experiences of stigma. In the second workshop, the facilitator reviewed hundreds of photos with the participants and distilled them down to the photos exhibited, which represented the issues most important to trans women.Manisha Dhakal, executive director of Blue Diamond Society, stated, “This is not a typical photo exhibition to be viewed from an artistic perspective. We are not romanticising the pain and struggles of the trans community. These are their unheard stories and hidden pain. Through this exhibit, we aim to provide a platform for trans women to share their challenges and progress”.True to Dhakal’s sentiment, the photos revealed the lives and struggles of rural trans women in Madhesh. Each photo was accompanied by short quotes from the women, adding depth and meaning. For the first time in my experience at an art gallery, there was no artist's perspective, only the raw, unfiltered voices of the people depicted. One photo showed a trans woman carrying a bag on her head, with a quote, “Heading to India for a performance. Walking because public vehicles wouldn’t let me board.” Another showed a trans woman carrying a milk pot with the quote, “People hesitate to buy milk from me because I'm queer. It’s hard to survive.”Likewise, another photo showed a trans woman in a sari with torn clothes, accompanied by the quote, “When we go to the market, people tear our clothes, they don’t respect us, sometimes they rape.”The phrase “sometimes they rape” was used so casually, yet it starkly depicts the harsh reality faced by trans women, who have become so vulnerable and accustomed to violence like harassment and rape that they speak of it lightly. For me, “sometimes” had always been associated with trivial activities like “sometimes I sing”, “sometimes I go climbing”, or “sometimes I write”, but hearing “sometimes they rape” was shocking and took on a new heavy meaning. Through the photos, the audience could see the vulnerable realities of trans women in rural areas. Even research indicates that rural transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) populations have a greater need for health services compared to their urban counterparts. They face unique barriers to accessing these services, and their health disparities are less researched than those of urban TGD populations.Another study shows that trans women in Nepal are highly stigmatised, leading to factors that increase their risk for HIV. Interventions are needed to support the economic and mental well-being of trans women to mitigate the heightened HIV risk from stigma. However, the healthcare systems and acceptance are lacking.Pinky Gurung, president of BDS, opined, “Through this, we aim to educate the general public, policymakers, and stakeholders about the realities faced by trans women in Nepal and advocate against the anti-gender movement.”The exhibit also featured a video collage of the daily lives of trans women. It showed how trans women are like any other people who wish to have ordinary lives but are forced to endure difficult lives due to societal stigma. It also showcased rare instances where trans women received necessary help and healthcare, offering hope for a more positive and accepting society.The exhibit's standout feature was that the photos were taken by trans women themselves, adding authenticity and a personal connection to their daily lives.The ‘Sweekar’ photovoice exhibit celebrates the achievements of the LGBTQIA+ community and underscores the need for continued action towards inclusivity and better health outcomes for all, especially trans women.Dr Erin Wilson, principal investigator of Sweekar, said, “Through photovoice, a participatory research method promoting critical self-awareness within social contexts, we hope to empower individuals to challenge stereotypes and reduce stigma towards trans women and HIV in Nepal while boosting empowerment and social support.”The exhibit moved to Janakpur on Monday and was presented yesterday at Mithila Yatri Niwas, Janakpur, from 12 pm onwards. Those who missed it in Kathmandu can visit the Sweekar website to view the photos and narrations. ","summary":"Siddhartha Art Gallery felt quite different last Saturday.

The ministry stated that the report’s recommendations will be implemented under Dahal’s leadership.The statement quoted Shrestha as saying, \"The government will implement positive and contextual suggestions.\"In August 2018, the government formed a 25-member commission led by Education Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. It involved education experts, representatives from teachers’ and private schools’ associations, and officials in the task of recommending the government on its education policy.The commission prepared the report after rigorous discussions and consultations with the stakeholders. On January 15, 2019, it was submitted to Oli. However, Oli was not interested in implementing the recommendations, so he never made the report public. His successor, Sher Bahadur Deuba, also followed suit.The commission has recommended that private schools be converted into “trusts” within 10 years. This would, according to the commission, stop the commercialisation of education. Conversion into trust means that the school owners cannot distribute their profits. Currently, most of the private schools operate as companies after getting registered in the Company Registrar's Office.The commission, according to its members, made its recommendations based on Article 31(2) of the constitution, which makes the state responsible for ensuring compulsory basic and free secondary education for all. The commission said that leaving private educators to “generate profit”, as they are doing at present, would be tantamount to a breach of the constitution.The private school operators objected to the provision. They had tried to pressure the commission to exclude it as the report was being finalised.Usha Jha, a member of the commission, said there was immense pressure from the private schools to keep the report unpublished.\"We worked really hard to prepare the report. All the recommendations aim to improve the country's education system,\" Jha told the Post. \"The education minister took a bold step to make the report public. I believe it gets implemented. In fact, the minister is already following the spirit of the commission's report.\" As the Oli government kept the report secret, a majority of members of the committee shared it with the media in December 2020. The National Campaign for Education, an umbrella body of over 400 organisations working in the education sector, had printed the report and distributed it at an event.However, the report coming out of the ministry holds a different meaning—that the government owns it, said Jha.The commission recommended that the government facilitate private sector investment in higher education and bring school education gradually under the government’s ambit. It also suggested partnerships between private and public schools to improve the latter’s quality.Hiring head teachers on contract after evaluating their performance, increasing education budget to at least 20 percent of the government’s spending as per its commitment and ensuring that every child gets basic education in his/her mother tongue are other major recommendations of the commission.Despite Nepal’s global commitment, the proportion of the national budget allocated to the education sector has been declining. The share of the education budget, which once amounted to 17 percent, is now down to 11 percent.Allocating at least 20 percent of the national budget, or 6.5 percent of the national GDP, to education is considered the global norm.Several commissions have been formed to recommend educational reforms over the past decades. However, most of the reports remain unimplemented. The Pokharel-led commission was the sixth formed since 1955 and third after the restoration of democracy in 1950 to look into matters concerning education.

Lawmaker Sharma said that in case of conflict between a central agency and a local unit, the federal government should show more restraint than the local government.“Mayor Balendra Shah’s initiative to widen pavements at New Road is the right step for the general public’s convenience,” Sharma told the House. “Mayor Shah should be allowed to continue his work without any interference as what he is doing is absolutely right.”The conflict escalated when the Road Division, under the federal government, intervened and paved the road cut by the metropolis on Monday. The metropolis had cleared stretches a few metres wide on either side of the road to create space for pavements. The dispute resulted in a standoff between those deployed by the Road Division and the Kathmandu municipal staff, with different people taking different sides. The tension eased without any untoward incident as the metropolis backed off after the federal government deployed police at the site.The Road Division, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is led by Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth, who is a UML secretary. The dispute grew to involve those supporting Mayor Shah and the UML, the biggest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, and also spilled over to social media.In Parliament, lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress threw their weight behind Shah.Not only the party’s general secretary Sharma, two other lawmakers from the party also expressed their support for the mayor in the House meeting on Thursday. Congress lawmaker Arjun Narsingh KC said the conflict between the federal government and the Kathmandu mayor has raised serious questions about the federal government’s intent. KC stressed that cooperation and collaboration between the federal, provincial, and local governments is essential in avoiding conflict and resolving disputes between the three federal units. He said Articles 232 and 235 of the constitution and related schedules clearly define their jurisdictions.“The recent conflict between the federal and local governments and the saga of making and breaking of a road section have raised serious questions,” KC said. He urged the government not to resort to violence and to resolve the issue in a rational way.Another Congress lawmaker, Kanti Sejuwal, also speaking in the zero hour of Parliament, questioned the government for clashing with the municipal authority. “Either we should scrap the Local Government Operation Act 2017, or the federal government should let Balendra work.”As the Road Division intervened in Mayor Shah’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area, Sejuwal had expressed his anger at UML chair Oli.Following the federal agency’s intervention, the mayor wrote on social media, alleging Oli’s involvement in the attempted illegal swapping of land at the Birtamode-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate worth billions of rupees. The largest party, the Congress, had been accusing the UML chief of being complicit in the land swap issue.A few days ago, Shah also engaged in a heated exchange with the KMC’s Ward 22 chairman Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member, over the sidewalk expansion. Even before that, municipal staff dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Kathmandu Road Division office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had inconvenienced the public.Earlier, on May 14, the Congress parliamentary party meeting had decided to raise the issue of the tea estate land in Parliament. The Oli government, formed after the 2017 general elections, allowed the owners of the tea estate to swap 343.19 bighas (232.43 hectares) of land it occupied, based on a revision to the Land Act (1964). The Act was revised in January 2020, under the Oli administration, introducing a provision for allowing a swap or selling of land to pay off the tea estate’s liabilities if it went into liquidation. Asked if the Congress had backed the mayor as he alleged the UML chair Oli’s involvement in the Tea Estate land scam, the Congress publicity department head Min Bahadur Bishwokarma denied it. “Party lawmakers including the general secretary must have backed the mayor as the New Road sidewalk issue is of public concern, and not necessarily because it involves the UML,” Bishwokarma said.

Officials said they started fixing potholes, concreting and other works on Wednesday.“We have allocated Rs30 million for the repairs, and the work started on Wednesday after completing the tender process,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC). “We have asked the contractor to complete the work at the earliest in view of the looming monsoon.”Every year, garbage disposal is affected during the monsoon season due to rain, landslides, and poor road conditions. Sometimes, garbage disposal is disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions result in a complete halt in door-to-door garbage collection for weeks, leading locals in the Valley to discard their trash on the streets and causing chaos in the city.“We are aware of the risks associated with obstructions in garbage disposal and their consequences,” said Shrestha. “We have been taking measures accordingly to lessen all possible risks.”The metropolis said that around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised.Meteorologists in Nepal anticipate the onset of monsoon by the end of next week, a few days ahead of the usual June 13 arrival of the weather system from the Bay of Bengal.KMC is also considering purchasing a high-pressure pump to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground. Recently, locals in the Sisdole area protested and stopped the trucks from disposing of garbage alleging the KMC’s negligence in leachate control.Municipal officials said that the Ministry of Urban Development took away a high-pressure pumpset from the landfill site's leachate pond some three months ago for maintenance, but has yet to return it. Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The city office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled.

It allows duty-free and quota-free access for all products (around 7,200) originating in LDCs, except for arms and ammunition.GSP is a special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance. GSP+ slashes these same tariffs to zero percent for vulnerable low- and lower-middle-income countries that implement 27 international conventions related to labour and human rights, environmental and climate protection, and good governance.“So, it is important to focus on the development of competitive and comparative advantage goods, their value addition, and quality assurance.

In September 2019, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies submitted draft legislation to establish a consumer court to the Ministry of Law, which then forwarded it to the Judicial Council.

The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.The Kathmandu Valley witnessed a massive cholera outbreak in the monsoon of 2022 in which 77 cholera-positive cases were confirmed. Hundreds of people suffered from diarrheal infections that continued for months.Experts say an outbreak of cholera in Kathmandu Valley before the onset of the monsoon is concerning, as rainwater contaminates most water resources, increasing the risk of more people getting infected from water-borne diseases including cholera. “More people could have been infected with cholera, as not all cases become severe and not all patients do not go to the hospital for treatment,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical research unit at the Sukraraj Hospital. “Many patients buy medicines from nearby pharmacies to recover at home.

However, most districts in the country have already reported outbreaks of the deadly disease even before the onset of monsoon.Public health experts have warned of a massive outbreak of the potentially deadly virus in the coming days, as the monsoon is just around the corner, and authorities are not doing much to prevent outbreaks.“Except counting the number of infected people and releasing statements, not much of substance is being done,” said Dr Baburam Gautam, a public health expert. “The general public has stopped taking such statements on dengue infection seriously.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,105 people from 69 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 69 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 112. Jhapa district recorded 109 cases, followed by Chitwan (73), Makwanpur (58), Sindhupalchok (44), Tanahun (39), Okhaldhunga (38), Doti (30), Rupandehi (28), and Bhaktapur (27). The three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur—together reported 157 cases of infections in this period.Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa, and Kalikot are among the mountain districts that have reported dengue cases.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Post-monsoon is considered a highly transmissible season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease around the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Experts say this is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks.Waiting for a massive outbreak would be a big mistake, they say. To reduce the risk, authorities should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance, and take other measures. Health ministry officials said that they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.“Even if massive outbreaks have not been seen in any place, many districts have already reported dengue cases,” said Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “We have alerted all relevant agencies to the risk of an outbreak in the coming days.”Authorities and agencies in some local units have launched activities to raise residents' awareness of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, Dahal said.Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities do not take it seriously. They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients having these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.

On Tuesday, Dhangadhi recorded 40.4 degrees Celsius, Nepalgunj 40.2 degrees Celsius and Birendranagar 37.3 degrees Celsius, the Met office’s data shows.Met officials anticipate monsoon will start at the end of next week and bring respite from scorching heat.Over 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 are being inoculated with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in a nationwide immunisation drive started on May 26.Officials said that children who missed the IPV vaccine during the routine immunisation programme will be administered the vaccine, as they are at risk of getting infected with Type-2 polio.Gautam said that vaccination programmes are being carried out smoothly in the rest of the places. The vaccine is being administered in schools, booths and health posts.Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but the World Health Organisation officially declared it polio-free on March 27, 2014 after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV).The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus.The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus.However, the Type -2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in the South Asia region to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN Health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Gautam said that due to global shortages of the IPV vaccine, children born between April 13, 2016, and October 18, 2018 were inoculated only with the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine.“Children who missed the IPV vaccine will be at high risk of poliovirus infection,” Gautam said. “So we are launching a campaign to inoculate them.”Health officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.Childhood immunisation is the number one priority of the government, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, however, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all.This figure was one percent in 2016.The Ministry of Health and Population said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country.

Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in the South Asia region to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN Health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Gautam said that due to global shortages of the IPV vaccine, children born between April 13, 2016, and October 18, 2018 were inoculated only with the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine.“Children who missed the IPV vaccine will be at high risk of poliovirus infection,” Gautam said. “So we are launching a campaign to inoculate them.”Health officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.Childhood immunisation is the number one priority of the government, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, however, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all.This figure was one percent in 2016.The Ministry of Health and Population said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country.

It requires a lot of investments and micro planning, which are currently lacking.”A recent report by the Ministry of Finance shows that 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births, the same results shown by the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The 16th five-year plan, which starts next fiscal year and ends in 2029, is aligned with the SDG targets.Public health experts say meeting the goal is easier said than done. Most health facilities having birthing centres lack neonatal units, trained human resources, and quality services.“Without ensuring quality services, which require trained human resources and advanced facilities, among others, it is impossible to reduce neonatal deaths,” said Upreti. “The government has made various plans to reduce child deaths—including neonatal deaths—but does not pay much attention to their effective implementation.”The finance ministry’s recent report shows that the institutional delivery rate increased to 80 percent from 79 percent last year. The rise in institutional deliveries has contributed to lessening the maternal mortality rate, which is 151 in every 100,000 live births.“Fifty percent of the neonates die in the first 24 hours of birth,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services. “Most of our health facilities, including birthing centres, lack proper infrastructures.”Study shows that 85 percent of all deaths among children under the age of five in Nepal take place before a child’s first birthday, with 64 percent occurring during the first month of life.Along with trained human resources, infrastructures and quality services, deaths of neonates are also linked to the antenatal care visit of pregnant women, access to health facilities, timely referral system and others, experts say. The government has been taking various measures to reduce neonatal deaths, including planning to set up a ‘special newborn care unit’ in all district hospitals throughout the country. For that, concerned agencies under the health ministry have imparted training to all doctors, nurses and paramedics serving in Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok and Makawanpur district hospitals.Special newborn care units are general units designed to care for newborn children who fall ill shortly after birth. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics monitor ailing children admitted to the unit.The health ministry has installed an underfloor heating system at birthing centres in four mountain districts to curb postpartum and neonatal deaths there.Underfloor heating is a form of central heating that ensures indoor climate control for thermal comfort. It uses an electrical heating cable installed underneath the flooring.Hypothermia, infection, low birth weight, premature birth, and abnormal birth asphyxia are among the leading causes of neonatal deaths, doctors say.Some of the programmes being undertaken to lower child mortality include newborn care, kangaroo care, exclusive breastfeeding, infection prevention, chlorhexidine for umbilical cord care, and free neonatal care. “Whatever the achievements we made so far were achieved by the measures taken as of now,” said Upreti. “The ongoing programme may not achieve further progress.

Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility.

Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says.

Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say.

Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength.

Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar.

They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution.

During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time.

Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides.

Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone.

I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness.

However, many have been deported, resulting in financial losses and mental anguish. The villagers have taken on large debts to finance these journeys, leading to a crisis in the community. Despite the hardships and risks involved, some continue to seek a better life abroad, leaving their families and village behind. The situation highlights the lack of economic opportunities in the region and the failure of the government to address the issue.","summary":"Bharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

The provinces are in a critical situation at the moment, as many of them are unstable. Over the past year and a half, the provinces have seen altogether 21 chief ministers and 23 floor tests.The frequent changes in the provincial governments have left the people disappointed with federalism, often questioning the very need of the provinces. However, they are not aware that this is happening due to the behaviour of senior party leaders and the federal government's neglect of the provinces. For instance, the federal government has yet to adjust the police for the provinces. The provision for adjusting police forces for the provinces was included in the budget speech for FY 2023-24 but nothing has been done yet. It seems unlikely to be addressed in the forthcoming fiscal year either, as it has not been included in either the policy and programme or the budget speech for FY 2024-25. Unless the chief ministers sit together at the Prime Minister's residence in Baluwatar, this issue will not be resolved easily or anytime soon.Downward budget trendThe provinces received an authorisation letter for a fiscal equalisation grant amounting to Rs58.67 billion for FY 2023-24. However, a few weeks ago, the federal government reduced this figure by 26 percent to Rs15.2 billion. This reduction has caused serious problems in the implementation of the provinces' programmes and projects. Furthermore, in the new budget for FY2024-25, the amount of fiscal transfers to the provinces has been significantly reduced. Despite this critical situation, the provinces have surprisingly failed to voice any concerns to the federal government.Regarding the total budget of the provinces, it was approximately Rs270 billion in FY 2023-24. The main sources of the provincial budget are grants (about 39 percent), followed by revenue sharing (VAT and excise duty), cash balance, and internal revenue. The share of internal revenue in the budget is 16 percent. The largest portion of the provincial budget (65 percent), comes through fiscal transfers, which include both grants and revenue sharing. The fiscal purse of the provinces is so limited that the total budget of the seven provinces from FY 2017-18 to FY 2023-24 was Rs1,586 billion, which is just Rs165 billion less than the budget of the federal government for FY 2023-24.The tax revenue rights of the provinces are minimal. Increasing the size of the provincial budget is possible only through fiscal transfers. These fiscal transfers are constitutional rights not only for the provinces but also for local levels. The fiscal transfers in the provinces' budget for FY 2024-25 is disappointing. For instance, in FY 2018-19, the first year full budget of the implementation of federalism, the budget of the Government of Nepal was Rs1,315 billion, while the grant for the provinces was Rs123 billion. This grant was 9.39 percent of the Nepal Government’s budget. The total budget size of the government for FY 2024-25 is Rs1,860 billion, an increase of Rs545 billion over this period.However, despite the significant increase in the overall budget, the grant for the provinces in FY 2024-25 is only Rs96 billion, which is Rs27 billion less than in FY 2018-19. In FY 2018-19, the provincial grant ratio was 9.39 percent of the government budget. This ratio has declined significantly to 5.18 percent in FY 2024-25. The provinces do not seem to be aware of these figures, but it is disappointing nevertheless.Federalism neglectedFurther, the policies and programmes of the ministries at the federal level have eroded the jurisdiction of the sub-federal levels. The federal government has intervened at the local level. While several sections of the budget mention coordination with the sub-federal levels, there is no actual consultation with these levels when presenting plans and programmes. How can the sub-federal levels take ownership of the plans and programmes developed without their coordination and cooperation? Article 81 of the Nepal Government’s budget states that Koshi will be developed as an industrial hub, Madhesh as an agricultural centre, Bagmati as an information technology hub, Gandaki as a tourism centre, Lumbini as a centre for small and medium industries, Karnali as a herbal hub, and Sudurpaschim as a religious tourism centre. However, there is no coordination with the provinces. These announcements have been made unilaterally without consultation with the provinces. Similarly, the budget mentions the Gandaki Economic Triangular Project concept without coordinating with the related provinces. Why has the federal government not discussed and consulted with the provinces regarding policies, programs, and potential plans? The constitution of Switzerland states that the federal government should consult with stakeholders, including the cantons (provinces), before implementing any new laws, programmes or projects. This consultation process is one of the key reasons for Switzerland's significant development across various sectors. For those affected by laws and policies, close discussions and consultations are essential to ensure full ownership and facilitate implementation, thereby promoting development. The rulers at the federal level have a centralist mindset. It should also be noted that in the Supreme Court decision related to the Giribandu Tea Estate, the court stated that sub-federal levels should be consulted when drafting any new bills related to concurrent rights. If one day, the Supreme Court decides on issues related to plans, programmes, and fiscal transfers and declares them unconstitutional, it should not be assumed otherwise.Centralist budgetConsider the budget from the perspective of ministerial allocation. According to the constitution, the responsibilities of ministries such as Finance, Defense, Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister's Office are central in nature. However, the responsibilities of most other ministries are connected to the sub-federal levels. Despite this, the Ministry of Forestry has allocated only 18 percent of its total budget, and the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration only 11 percent for the provinces. The Ministry of Urban Development has allocated 8 percent, the Ministry of Health 7 percent, the Ministry of Water Supply 5 percent, the Ministry of Women 3 percent, the Ministry of Education 2 percent, and the Ministry of Labor only 1 percent of their budgets for the provinces. Several ministries, including Tourism, Industry, Home, Sports, Physical Infrastructure, Land and Cooperatives, Communications, and Law, have not allocated any funds to the provinces. The Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation has allocated only 0.7 percent of the total budget for the provinces.Most of the budget of the Ministry of Education and Labor is allocated to the local level, which is not an issue. However, it is unfortunate that the development ministries' budgets are not allocated to the provinces, as this undermines the essence of provincial governance. The constitution considers the province a key actor in development, but the budgets that should go to the provinces have been withheld by these Singadurbar-based ministries.Even an analysis of ministerial budget allocations from the first budget of federalism implementation (FY 2018-19) to FY 2024-25 reveals that except for 8 to 10 ministries, all others have reduced the jurisdiction of the sub-federal levels. I have detailed the analysis of ministries' programmes and projects for FY 2023-24 in this newspaper. I find that we do not need more than eight to 10 ministries at the federal level. When more than 60 percent of the functional responsibilities have been devolved to the sub-federal level, why do we need many ministries at the federal level? In Switzerland, there are only seven ministers at the federal level, including the President.To conclude, as the provinces prepare to present their budgets, they continue to suffer due to the federal government’s neglect of them. Fiscal transfers to the provinces have been significantly reduced, undermining federalism. Frequent changes in provincial governments, lack of support from the federal level, and insufficient coordination on policies and budgets complicate this issue.

The scorching heat and record high temperatures in Delhi are accompanied with an acute water shortage. People are queuing up in the heat to collect water from tankers and the economically weaker section is the worst affected. The Hon’ble Supreme Court has ordered Himachal Pradesh to release 137 cusecs of surplus water and has asked Haryana to cooperate in its safe passage to Delhi via River Yamuna. Delhi, on its part, must ensure no wastage of this additional water being received from Himachal Pradesh. Delhi primarily depends on the Yamuna for meeting its water requirement.The river originates in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand and flows through Himachal Pradesh and along the Haryana-Uttar Pradesh border before entering Delhi. At Delhi, it is tapped by the Wazirabad barrage from where water is sent for treatment and subsequent supply. The water level at Wazirabad barrage reservoir has dipped considerably resulting in less water availability for treatment and supply. The Delhi Government has blamed Haryana for insufficient supply of water in the river. The Haryana Government has quickly refuted the charges stating that water over and above the agreed quantity is being released by it. Delhi’s water crisis is largely a result of its own inactions; a direct consequence of unplanned urban development.The Delhi Government’s Economic Survey report has recorded the consistent increase in water demand of the city—all the way to 1,290 million gallons per day (MGD). Water production and supply, however, has remained limited at 935 to 1,000 MGD. It is as if the city is under a perpetual “Day Zero” situation, where the municipal supply system does not have sufficient water to supply to households. Most of the year, Delhi manages to cope with this water shortage, and there is considerable dependence on groundwater sources. However, the pre-monsoon summer months intensify the crisis, and high evaporation rates and peak water demand exacerbates the scarcity.Global warming and extreme heatwave events, like the one witnessed this year, are bound to worsen the water situation in Delhi. An increase in the frequency of similar hot weather events is predicted by some climate change models and this should set alarm bells ringing. While the Delhi Government has made efforts to augment the water supply, including buying more than the natural share of water in the river Yamuna from upstream states, recycling water and water storage, these are short term measures that will soon become inadequate. A permanent solution to this crisis should begin with a reality check on why Delhi has such a high water demand, and what can be done to optimize this ever-increasing demand. It is only through such a demand-side intervention that Delhi can be put back on the path of sustainable development.In addition, Delhi needs to take climate action planning more seriously, beginning with introducing stronger measures to protect its wetlands. The Yamuna, which has seen considerable degradation of its floodplain, should not be remembered only during the time of crisis. The entire stretch of the Yamuna and its floodplain in Delhi must be declared an eco-sensitive zone to safeguard its groundwater recharging potential. This will help the dwindling groundwater resources of the city; according to the Central Ground Water Board, groundwater is overexploited in 38 percent of Delhi and its status is critical to semi-critical in 47 percent of the city.Yamuna floodplain conservation will also help prevent flooding around the river which often follows the summer months and shifts focus away from water scarcity. However, this does not take away from the fact that the water crisis in Delhi aggravates during the summer months and makes life miserable for its citizens. While government action is called for, citizens also must contribute their part by conserving water and preventing its unnecessary wastage. The decision to not wash cars with a hose or pipe amidst the water crisis should be voluntary. It should not require government action in the form of the Rs2,000 fine that has now been imposed. Citizens must also maintain the ponds and lakes in their neighbourhoods and protect them from being encroached.Water scarcity is a public health hazard and must be swiftly addressed. The earlier rulers of Delhi had taken extraordinary measures for securing water for their people. These include the construction of the vibrant Hauz Khas Lake complex and some exquisite baolis (step wells) like the Agrasen ki baoli near Connaught Place. Perhaps it’s time to revisit these structures, not just for their architectural beauty but also to consider drawing water from them at least during the summer months.-The Statesman (India)/ANN ","summary":"Delhi's water crisis intensifies due to scorching heat, leading to acute water shortage as citizens queue for tankers amidst allegations of insufficient supply from Haryana and Himachal Pradesh releasing surplus water."},{"hash":"05920eac165c2cde635e8c2aecc2603607c7abcdef92cc834b24a59e592dbd1c","title":"policy-recommendation-to-end-untouchability","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/06/10/policy-recommendation-to-end-untouchability","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2019/default/IMG0721-1718067799.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1717977600000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"Nepal is a de facto caste-apartheid state. A 2007 Human Rights Watch report on the “untouchables” of India observed, “The only parallel to the practice of untouchability was apartheid in South Africa.” The HRW has declared caste discrimination a form of “hidden apartheid”—an apt observation for Nepal as well.In the past years, caste hatred and exclusion have become more concealed yet pervasive in the Himalayan region; caste has also spread its tentacles in the global diaspora. Last month, Amnesty International criticised the government’s utter apathy and lack of accountability on the persistent plight of Dalits. The communist-populist alliance in government doesn’t seem to heed the call for change. This is clear from recently announced government policies, programmes and budgets for the fiscal year 2024-25. The authorities are bent on keeping caste hierarchy and untouchability sacred and solid. Budget for ‘Dalit skills’On March 21, 2022, attending a Dalit function in Kathmandu, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal declared that he was making a big announcement for the dignity and freedom of the “untouchables”. So much so that, he said, they would not forget it in over a century. He hasn’t made his supposedly phenomenal Dalit project explicit, but some Dalits still haven’t given up their hopes. Something came with this year’s budget for the Dalit community: Rs200 million to enhance Dalits’ traditional skills to create employment and promote their livelihood. This small yet seemingly significant budget has buoyed some Dalits. After all, as everybody says, something is better than nothing. However, I’m sceptical about the effectiveness of the Dalit-centred budget. Is it a big enough pot of money to significantly impact the target population? Most people would say “No”. Even some prominent Dalit NGO personalities close to the governing parties have expressed their dissatisfaction with the amount. Equally, are Dalits the only beneficiaries of this new scheme? I don't think so. The details of the intended 200-million project haven’t been developed yet. But it seems many non-Dalits will also get the support, especially those close to the ruling parties and leaders. There are at least two reasons for my understanding. First is the very name of the entity the government plans to establish to use that money: A separate body called the “Dalit, Neglected and Oppressed Class Upliftment and Development Corporation.” The use of so many words is likely intended to involve the beneficiaries from different castes and social groups. My suspicion stems from the second fact: In today’s Nepal, traditional Dalit skills—such as goldsmithing, tailoring, woodworking, and shoemaking—are no longer exclusively practised by Dalits. Once commercialised, many castes including the apex groups, have started these trades. So, skill enhancement projects will probably not be offered only to Dalits. I am not suggesting Dalits should have exclusive rights over these essential skills. It is neither practical nor proper to make such a case. My point is that it is probably wrong to think that the budget is for the betterment of Dalits. Untouched untouchabilityI have a serious objection to the utter lack of sensitivity towards the problems of Dalits, mainly the persistent practice of untouchability (hidden apartheid) in government policies, programmes and the budget. There is no single statement in the policies that mentions untouchability, let alone try to address it. The same applies to the state and local authorities under the federal system. The biggest irony is found in the Karnali Province, where the Province Head, Tilak Pariyar, is a Dalit man with a long history of fighting against the state as part of the Maoist movement, with ending caste oppression as a primary goal. On May 23, he presented 84-point policies and programmes of the province. Study it in detail, and aside from lip service here and there, there is no serious concern about the situation of Dalits in Karnali who have been facing caste humiliation and violence like nowhere else in the country. Yet the authorities seem totally blind to the realities! Recommended policy objectives What should a responsible government do, both in Kathmandu and Karnali? First, the federal capital should become sensitive towards the plight of Dalits, who suffer tremendously due to popular beliefs and practices of ritual impurity. Then, the federal capital should design a national policy framework that could be followed by the lower authorities.On a Sunday press meet, Caste Watch Network (CWN), a newly launched Dalit campaign group, recommended two fundamental policy objectives for tackling the complex problem of untouchability.First, the state should introduce new laws and policies—sticks and carrots—to enforce the constitutional and legal provisions against untouchability. It could, for example, forge a policy of immediately suspending government officials guilty of excluding and humiliating Dalits. Elderly people who discriminate against Dalits could be deprived of their elderly pensions for two years or so. Any temple practising Dalit exclusion could be deprived of state support in the form of money and sacred offerings and sacrificial animals (yes, even the historical and famous temples like Gorakhkali and Manakamana do practise a form of social exclusion). The second important policy objective would be to reform the religion. Some people frown at my suggestions about initiating religious and cultural reform, which they think takes many decades, if not centuries.While we cannot easily rewrite casteist texts like Manusmriti and Parasaramriti, it is possible to achieve the reformation of some religious beliefs and practices over time. For that, the secular state should stand firm against religious dogma and formulate proper laws and implement them. If no religious and/or cultural reform were possible at all, we would still be burning our mothers and sisters and other women alive on the sati pyres. If reform weren’t possible, we wouldn’t see a section of Bahuns drinking alcohol and consuming pork, and, as alluded to earlier, engaging in tailoring, drumming, shoemaking and goldsmithing. Upper castes have deceived Dalits. They have forced religious and cultural transformations in areas that benefit them materially and in other ways. And they have been opposed to the reform of those areas of religious and cultural traditions that would ensure equal rights for Dalits. For example, a Bahun doesn’t become polluted by drinking and drumming; these transgressions do not anger his deities. But he thinks he and his family, lineage and other deities and spirits become polluted if a drummer enters his house. Religious-cultural reform is not as tough as it seems. Governments and authorities at all levels should introduce new laws and policies and spend large sums to change the spiritual, religious and cultural spheres. Without this, we cannot do away with untouchability. ","summary":"Nepal is a de facto caste-apartheid state.

The Upendra Yadav-led party is holding the mega event at a time the party has suffered multiple setbacks. Seven of its 12 federal lawmakers split the JSP-Nepal and registered a new outfit—Janata Samajbadi Party—at the Election Commission last month. The party of Upendra Yadav, who headed the party that had continuously led Madhesh provincial government since 2018, has been pushed to the opposition bench in the provincial assembly. Yadav, who was deputy prime minister and health minister in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Cabinet until last month, has been ousted from the federal government as well. Despite such adverse circumstances, Yadav is poised to be the party chief again, most likely unopposed.Yadav rose to power after successfully spearheading a Madhesh movement in 2007 demanding rights for the historically marginalised Madheshi people. Though the demand for federalism had been raised by various quarters even in the past, it was Yadav-led agitation that eventually forced the Nepali state to introduce the federal system in the country. He formed Madheshi Janadhikar Forum-Nepal under his own leadership. Since then he has always been at the helm of a party. He has merged his party with various outfits, multiple times, only to split again.With the rise of Madheshi parties in the aftermath of the second people’s movement in 2006, people—not only from the southern belt of the country but also from most marginalised communities—had high hopes for a paradigm shift in Nepali politics. The big parties traditionally holding power, namely the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, had felt pressure.

There is not a single party in Madhesh that remained intact, which is disappointing for those who expected that regional forces would build pressure on traditional forces through better delivery.Mismanagement, lack of organisational discipline, non-transparency and top leaders’ monopoly in decision-making have become common traits of Madhesh-based parties. Big parties such as the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre are criticised for being monopolistic and rather undemocratic. But, newer forces proved themselves worse. For instance, at least the big parties have been holding their general conventions as per the constitutional provision.

That is why the UML is considered the most organised party in the country. The Congress also follows at least basic democratic norms while electing its leaders and making important decisions. But we don’t see the same in Madhesh-based and other newly emerged forces. This is unfortunate. Only political parties that are well-organised, democratic and transparent in their activities will have the moral strength to mount pressure on big forces.

Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces.

The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement. ","summary":"Lawmaker Jiban Pariyar, a joint general secretary of the Nepali Congress, the main opposition, was a member of the four-member taskforce that prepared the terms of reference (ToR) of the parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers.

During her four-day visit, she interacted with people from all walks of life, including the prime minister, in an attempt to gauge the human rights situation here. In this interview with Binod Ghimire of the Post, Callamard talked about the human rights situation in Nepal and the rest of the world. Excerpts: You have been travelling this part of the world, interacting with people. How do you evaluate the human rights situation here?Human rights are backsliding everywhere. It’s a global phenomenon. There is backsliding on civil and political rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is backsliding on women’s rights and non-discrimination on economic rights, and in terms of armed conflicts. The number of people dying in armed conflicts is increasing exponentially. We are in deep trouble as far as human rights protection is concerned. The South Asia region hasn’t been immune to the global trend.For my mission, I am visiting Sri Lanka and Nepal. In the two countries, we observe the shrinking of civic space and greater weaponisation of laws to curtail freedom of expression, particularly online. The digital laws are often overbroad and disproportionate. Banning TikTok in Nepal, for instance, is a disproportionate overbroad measure of the violation of international laws. We are observing a great deal of attacks in protests. The use of lethal force or disproportionate use of force by the police in response to even peaceful protests is increasing. There are incidents where protestors have died after the use of police force. There are issues of impunity for past crimes. A study by a European research centre shows that fewer people live in democracies worldwide in 2024 than in 1986. This is a complete U-turn. What do you see as the reasons for the backsliding? There are several factors that explain the backsliding. One could be growing restlessness and anxiety due to economic downturns. There was a severe financial crisis in 2008, and we didn't really recover from it. The inequalities within states and between states have increased in the last decade. We have seen a sharp increase in the wealth of the super-rich. On the other hand, the poor are getting poorer. This is feeding anger and creating fertile ground for populism. The authoritarian leaders are feeding on that particular ground. The backsliding is also linked to Covid that had a terrible impact on the economy and society. During Covid, the governments adopted different emergency measures but, in many cases, those measures were never lifted. In Europe, refugees, migrants and minorities are viewed as the reasons why the economy is not picking up and they are accused of stealing jobs. In every country, the minorities have been made the scapegoats. There is a resentment that democracy has not delivered for the people. The expectations are high, but the governments have failed to act accordingly. Therefore, the people are prepared to listen to the authoritarian leaders. By authoritarian leaders, I do not mean those who are in power by force but those who are democratically elected. They are elected by the people, but they practise authoritarianism once they get into power. In Nepal, the burning problem of authoritarianism has been reflected even in local politics. For instance, the mayor of Kathmandu has resorted to repeated attacks against street vendors and landless people. These are authoritarian moves. Such leaders target vulnerable groups who cannot protect themselves. You are in Nepal at a time the government has arrested the owner of the largest media house. How does Amnesty International look at this situation?We are very alarmed and upset. We call on the government to release him immediately. Even if the charges are valid, they certainly do not justify imprisoning him. Amnesty International believes that the use of those charges is politically motivated and is an attempt to stifle dissent. It is a response to the professional investigation and reporting about the policies and practices of those in power. This is an attempt to silence him, to silence the news media and to silence journalists. By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights.We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority.Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated?Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected.We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology.Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesn’t stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Do you think other countries should follow the European Union’s footsteps?Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings.Why do you think Nepal’s transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward?Sadly, the transitional justice process hasn’t progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. That’s the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice.You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutors’ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire. This is nonsense.Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. In fact, peace is not sustainable without justice. When justice is not delivered, the conflict is bound to recur. It is just a matter of time. We often hear the excuse that if a particular leader or a person is prosecuted, that would affect peace. On the contrary, not investigating the perpetrator is a real challenge to peace. Many people who are in power after a peace deal themselves are guilty of war crimes. They don’t want to be held accountable. It is not in their interest to deliver transitional justice. It takes an incredible, highly moral and principled leadership to take the process ahead.We have seen here that the transitional justice process has been paralysed. Successive governments have failed to act on the Comprehensive Peace Accord. They haven’t acted on what the Supreme Court told them in 2015. It had directed them to review, revise and reform the Transitional Justice Act.Here I have seen the categorisation of crimes as serious and non-serious, which is very strange. It is shocking to me that some killings are considered non-serious, and could lead to de facto amnesty for those responsible for them, even though these crimes fall under international law. If someone was killed after torture then two crimes have been committed—torture and killing. Right to life is the most important right. The investigation should be done accordingly. The same is the case with sexual violence with rape and without rape.What is alarming is that people are losing trust. If people do not trust the systems that are supposed to deliver justice, that will cause a big problem. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons couldn’t undertake proper investigation and prosecution. Not all have received the government’s relief, which has led to much frustration and animosity. There is political interference on transitional justice, which also lacks independence and transparency.We are calling on the authorities to act as directed by the Supreme Court, ratify the statute on the International Criminal Court as well as the International Convention on Disappearance. Do you see chances of international interference if Nepal continues to delay justice delivery?There is no doubt that some crimes committed during the war fall within universal jurisdiction. If the perpetrators of those crimes travel to countries where a framework of universal jurisdiction has been enacted, they could be arrested there. We are seeing the multiplication of universal jurisdiction cases in Europe.Cases of custodial deaths, torture and extrajudicial killings are common in Nepal. How can they be checked?Different organisations like Amnesty International should be monitoring the abuse of power by the police and state authorities. There must be impartial and fair investigation of such incidents. But there is a regime of impunity. The police are not very keen to investigate themselves. I wanted to mention the case of Ajit Mijar, which is an example of justice being denied. It also shows the complicity of the institution in denying justice.Nepal is ranked the fourth most vulnerable country due to climate change though it contributes negligibly in greenhouse gas emissions. The largest polluters haven't fulfilled their responsibilities towards Nepal. How can organisations like Amnesty advocate for countries like Nepal?Amnesty International has long been advocating for climate justice. We have a set of demands. We are advocating at the United Nations level and also at the COP. We are pushing through COP our message of loss and damage, about the responsibilities of industrialised countries to cut their reliance on fossil fuel industries and so on. The impact of global warming will lead to loss of lives in places like Nepal and Pacific Islands.We saw very timid steps taken in COP in UAE last year. These steps are far from sufficient. We see countries multiplying their investments in fossil fuel while big fossil fuel companies are also violating their written commitment to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. This is alarming.However, we have made some progress on loss and damage. Governments are recognising the principle of loss and damage for the countries that are least responsible for climate change. They can rely on some kind of global financial system to protect and support them in case of a sudden climate related crisis. We are now advocating for the responsible countries to set aside the necessary funds.Nepal is at the receiving end of climate change though the country is not responsible for it. However, the Nepali government also has a responsibility towards its people. The extreme weather risk faced by Nepal demands urgent acts from the authorities. The most vulnerable communities are at particular risk. The government must have instruments to protect them.  ","summary":"Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard was in Nepal last week as a part of her first South Asian tour.

The most vulnerable communities are at particular risk. The government must have instruments to protect them.  "},{"hash":"3f032051d0a2e55ade7bafb8356409bb34776169f26650f7ccc2c83b1a7cfec0","title":"if-oli-continues-to-manoeuvre-there-might-be-other-coalitions","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/05/19/if-oli-continues-to-manoeuvre-there-might-be-other-coalitions","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2019/interviews/interview01-1716183251.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1716076800000,"source":"kp","category":"interviews","content":"The CPN (Unified Socialist), which was fashioned in 2021 by a splinter faction of the CPN-UML, is preparing to hold its first general convention.

We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party.

Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   ","summary":"United Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal Hanaa Singer-Hamdy has worked for close to 30 years across development and humanitarian contexts in senior management and strategic leadership roles. Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   "},{"hash":"fd2424c1065b84036a2c2e74c88707f488e459e3a1d71690fd61f2223a348a64","title":"today-s-weather-june-12-2024","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/weather/2024/06/12/today-s-weather-june-12-2024","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/IMG20240514WA0004-1717380236.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1718150400000,"source":"kp","category":"weather","content":"The Meteorology Forecasting Division has said that the weather will be partly cloudy across the country today.The weather will be partly to generally cloudy in Koshi, Bagmati and Gandaki and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the country.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is also likely to occur at a few places of Koshi Province and in a few places of the hilly region of Bagmati and Gandaki provinces.

They could be affected in some ways in the upcoming monsoon,” says the risk and damage assessment prepared by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) for the upcoming monsoon season. “As many as 83,000 households will be directly affected, and 18,000 families need to be rescued in monsoon-related disasters.”However, the vulnerable populations have still been residing in places designated by the expert groups as unfit for living. There are hundreds of such places across the country where thousands of people are living in disaster-prone areas, government officials concede. What concerns experts is apart from flooding, landslides and innundations, the country witnessed several other monsoon-related incidents to which adequate attention has not been paid.“Neither the vulnerable populations will relocate to safe places nor the authorities concerned have any immediate plans to relocate them,” an official at the authority said, asking not to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media. The country’s limited resources cannot pay for their relocation.Experts from the authority say that most districts in the Tarai could be affected by flooding this rainy season. The vulnerable places include Rapti-Sonari Rural Municipality of Banke, Bardiya, Tikapur of Kailali, Triveni-Susta Rural Municipality of Nawalparasi West, Kalahari Rural Municipality of Morang, and several places of Rautahat.Several places in West Rukum, Jajarkot, Helambu, and Melamchi of Sindhupalchok, Sangurigadhi Rural Municipality of Dhankuta, Maiwakhola Rural Municipality of Taplejung, and Chumnubri of Gorkha are designated as most vulnerable to landslides during the monsoon, due to begin this week. The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology predicts above-average rainfall this year, with the added risk of flooding and landslides.“We are not doing anything for the prevention of disasters or the relocation of the most vulnerable populations to safety,” said Mahendra Shrestha, former chief specialist at the Ministry of Health and Population. “Concerned authorities have made a preparedness plan, but there is nothing about prevention.”Monsoon in Nepal is a season of epidemics, with thousands of people across the country getting infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases. Snakebite incidents and resulting deaths are also common during the season but the phenomenon, which experts dub “a lurking invisible crisis”, remains grossly neglected. Scores die, and thousands of people get infected with the dengue virus every monsoon.Most sources of drinking water generally become contaminated during the rainy season. People residing in disaster-hit areas, and those displaced by natural disasters are highly vulnerable to infections with waterborne and vector-borne diseases.Officials at the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority said they have started preparations accordingly to deal with possible incidents of disasters in the coming days.The authority has prepared the ‘Monsoon Preparedness and Response Plan-2081” to deal with disaster incidents.Agencies under the ministries including the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Health and Population, Ministry of Urban Development, and Ministry of Water Supply have a crucial role in disaster response. UN agencies also play a major role by providing aid, according to Dijan Bhattarai, spokesperson for the authority. “Logistics and relief materials have already been stocked up in the warehouses of all seven provinces and 12 logistics hubs.”Officials say each and every agency, including the Army, Police, Armed Police Force, non-governmental organisations, and agencies under ministries, have their own responsibilities and they should act proactively during disasters.Experts say that Nepali authorities have not learned anything from the experiences, mistakes, and blunders they made in the past and do not try to avoid the same mistakes again and again.“Authorities make the plan to count the victim’s number, fly choppers to ferry leaders and ministers to disaster-hit areas and distribute relief materials but do not make any plan for preventing disasters,” said Shrestha, the former chief specialist.“More people get affected in the aftermath of disasters than in the disasters. The risk of disease outbreaks increased in the aftermath of disasters, and problems of malnutrition, and mental health, among others, increased.”In the past few years, the country has been receiving more rainfall in short durations—an abnormal phenomenon that is slowly becoming a new normal. Experts say changes in rainfall patterns, which have become severe and erratic in the past few years as an impact of climate change, have contributed to extreme weather events like floods and landslides annually.
