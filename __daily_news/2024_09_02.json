Announcing the date of the next general convention was one of the contentious issues at the central committee, which met for almost a month with gaps in between. Now the committee decided to hold the convention as per the partyâs statuteâbut without specifying the convention dates.Under the party charter, every elected body is given a four-year term. The charter provides a yearâs extension if the general convention cannot be held within four years. Further, if an emergency renders it impossible to hold the convention, Nepalâs constitution permits a six-month postponement.During the central committee meeting, the dissident faction in the Congress demanded that the next general convention be held on time, that is by the end of 2025. But a final decision was made without specifying the dates, giving the leadership the room for manoeuvre.But party general secretary Gagan Thapa denies the charge. On the general convention, the agreement reached is a win-win for both the rival and establishment factions, he said.âBefore declaring the general convention we had to form a legislative committee, to which the central committee agreed,â Thapa told the Post. âNot declaring the date of general convention may have given the impression of victory to the party president, but there was also a win for us when the party agreed to form a legislation drafting committee.â Even though the party statute mentions that a general convention should be held every four years, the same statute also allows for a one-year postponement of the convention. The legislation committee will be entrusted to draft the partyâs statute that is endorsed by the periodic convention. The Congress secretariat members also say the party wouldnât be able to hold the general convention by the end of 2025 even if the dates were declared. The partyâs statute mentions that a year before the general convention, the party should complete conventions at the local level. For that, the party must hold its local conventions by the end of December. The Congress central committee meeting, which was supposed to end on August 28, was extended until Sunday in the absence of consensus among the top leaders on the report presented by the general-secretary duo. The central committeeâs concluding meeting also decided to pass the policy proposal presented by Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka, the organisational proposal presented by General Secretary Thapa, and the contemporary political proposal presented by Bishwa Prakash Sharma at the partyâs Mahasamiti meeting back in February.The Mahasamiti meeting unanimously passed the three important proposals of Khadka, Thapa, and Sharma. However, it had also kept the space open for the central working committee to modify the proposal before its endorsement. A meeting of the present and former Congress office bearers on Saturday decided to take a midway approach to the two proposals that Thapa and Sharma presented during the Mahasamiti meeting. The party leaders have no fundamental differences on the proposal presented by Vice-president Khadka. In Thapaâs proposal, he urges not forging a political alliance for the next election, among other things, while Sharma had proposed the âexit policy.â For consensus on the proposal tabled by the two general secretaries, Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba sat with them multiple times before Sundayâs meeting.The meeting approved Thapaâs proposal with minor changes but Sharmaâs paper has been pushed back to be considered while amending the constitution as it includes broad national issues such as term limits on persons serving as the countryâs president or the prime minister, party leaders say. âGeneral Secretary Sharmaâs proposal was related not only to the partyâs statute but also to the constitution, so the party has decided to raise the issue while amending the constitution,â Prakash Saran Mahat, the party spokesperson, told the Post.On Thapaâs proposal, the central committee decided that all the partyâs supporters and well-wishers would vote for the Congress symbol of âtreeâ in the next election without mentioning whether the party would forge any election alliance.However, Thapa claims that his original proposal presented at the Mahasamiti meeting has been passed by the central committee. âThere are no changes.âMin Bahadur Bishwokarma, the partyâs publicity department head, has a different take. âYes, we decided that our well-wishers and party supporters will be able to stamp on the partyâs election symbol in the next election,â Bishwokarma told the Post. âBut we have not ruled out electoral alliances either.âParty leaders close to Deuba are in favour of leaving the final decision on strategic issues like forging alliances to election-time. The proposal that the party passed is open to electoral alliances, though the preference is not to forge such alliances, Bishowkarma said. In his contemporary political proposal, Sharma has proposed an âexit policy for senior leaders', recommending term limits: one term for the [countryâs] President, two terms for prime ministers, three terms for ministers, and four terms for lawmakers. The central committee also has given legitimacy to the seven-point agreement it signed with the CPN-UML. The two parties forged a governing coalition based on the July 1 agreement. Under this, UML chair and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli would hand over the reins to Deuba after two years. âOur party is committed to the power-sharing deal with the UML,â Thapa told the Post. âAs the countryâs two largest parties have come together to form the government, we donât have the luxury of failing to deliver. Only through delivery can we remove public disenchantment towards the political parties,â Thapa said. âWe have agreed to give the government our full support.â ","summary":"The Nepali Congress Central Working Committee on Sunday decided to hold the 15th general convention as stipulated in the party charter. Announcing the date of the next general convention was one of the contentious issues at the central committee, which met for almost a month with gaps in between. Now the committee decided to hold the convention as per the partyâs statuteâbut without specifying the convention dates.Under the party charter, every elected body is given a four-year term. The charter provides a yearâs extension if the general convention cannot be held within four years. Further, if an emergency renders it impossible to hold the convention, Nepalâs constitution permits a six-month postponement.During the central committee meeting, the dissident faction in the Congress demanded that the next general convention be held on time, that is by the end of 2025. But a final decision was made without specifying the dates, giving the leadership the room for manoeuvre.But party general secretary Gagan Thapa denies the charge. On the general convention, the agreement reached is a win-win for both the rival and establishment factions, he said.âBefore declaring the general convention we had to form a legislative committee, to which the central committee agreed,â Thapa told the Post. âNot declaring the date of general convention may have given the impression of victory to the party president, but there was also a win for us when the party agreed to form a legislation drafting committee.â Even though the party statute mentions that a general convention should be held every four years, the same statute also allows for a one-year postponement of the convention. The legislation committee will be entrusted to draft the partyâs statute that is endorsed by the periodic convention. The Congress secretariat members also say the party wouldnât be able to hold the general convention by the end of 2025 even if the dates were declared. The partyâs statute mentions that a year before the general convention, the party should complete conventions at the local level. For that, the party must hold its local conventions by the end of December. The Congress central committee meeting, which was supposed to end on August 28, was extended until Sunday in the absence of consensus among the top leaders on the report presented by the general-secretary duo. The central committeeâs concluding meeting also decided to pass the policy proposal presented by Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka, the organisational proposal presented by General Secretary Thapa, and the contemporary political proposal presented by Bishwa Prakash Sharma at the partyâs Mahasamiti meeting back in February.The Mahasamiti meeting unanimously passed the three important proposals of Khadka, Thapa, and Sharma. However, it had also kept the space open for the central working committee to modify the proposal before its endorsement. A meeting of the present and former Congress office bearers on Saturday decided to take a midway approach to the two proposals that Thapa and Sharma presented during the Mahasamiti meeting. The party leaders have no fundamental differences on the proposal presented by Vice-president Khadka.

Political parties displayed exemplary unity in the course of endorsing the bill, which was promptly welcomed by the international community. If this undertaking succeeds, the remaining tasks of Nepalâs nearly two-decade-long peace process will be completed. In this context, the Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert and former lawmaker Radheshyam Adhikari of Nepali Congress, who has over the years been closely involved in Nepalâs transitional justice process.As a legal expert, how do you see the latest amendment in the transitional justice Act?Looking at it from a legal perspective, the Supreme Courtâs order given in this context is the major basis. The amendment has complied with over 95 percent of the top courtâs directives. There is one more context we can refer to. The government in 2018 had prepared a âzero draftâ on this issue. The international community had expressed their reservations on certain provisions. Most of the contents of that draft have been retained while addressing those reservations. There are some major improvements. The amendment has taken a more liberal approach to victimsâ rights. For instance, the draft had only said that the victims would be consulted for reconciliation but the latest amendment made victimsâ consent mandatory. If a victim doesnât want to give consent, he or she can go to court. This is a major change. Likewise, the draft had said the verdict of the to-be-formed Special Court [with a mandate to hear and decide the transitional justice related cases] would be final. But the amendment has allowed the dissatisfied side to appeal in the Supreme Court. There is a plan for a separate fund to carry out transitional justice related tasks so as to ensure fiscal autonomy for the two transitional justice commissions. This process needs fiscal as well as administrative autonomy. You just mentioned that the new Act has complied with 95 percent of the top courtâs directives. Could you elaborate on the remaining five percent?I meant to say that the amendment is closer to the courtâs directives. I canât say it is 100 percent because even they [the Supreme Court justices] at the time said âso and soâ should be done on a hypothetical ground as so many things were still evolving. Now, some issues might have become redundant. But most of the things have been addressed. See, first, we should have conceptual clarity. There is a fundamental difference between retributive justice and transitional justice systems. In retributive justice, cases are decided by regular courts based on existing laws while in the transitional justice system we have to look into political, social as well as cultural aspects. This is the internationally accepted approach.The amendment has included a provision of up to 75 percent reduced sentencing. The attorney general, who works for the government, is mandated to recommend this. Isnât this akin to directing the court? Wouldnât it instead be prudent to leave that to the court? If that were not done, there would be mistrust and the process may not have gotten sufficient support from the warring sides of the past. In such a scenario, the process may have again failed. A supportive role of the stakeholders will be crucial. Of late, I often urge the victims to cooperate with the process; otherwise it will remain a never-ending process. Itâs already too late. So, now we should be pragmatic. We should carry out things on a priority basis. Finding and respecting truth are the first and second priorities. The option to go to court is there, if someone wants so. The fourth priority is reparation. The goal is to establish that no one will need to take up arms and resort to violence in Nepal again. Now, most of the stakeholders are positive about concluding this process. The international community has in fact asked us what type of support we need.It is said the role of Desmond Tutu, who led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, was crucial for the success of the countryâs transitional justice process. Do you think the personality of the heads of the commissions will be vital in our case as well?Leadership definitely matters. In Colombia as well, a person of similar stature, who is respected by all sides in the country, led the process. So, the leadership and composition of the commissions will matter. The commissions should be allowed to work and make decisions on their own.There are nearly 64,000 complaints with the TRC and around 2,400 with the CIEDP. How should the commissions carry out their task? Will they deal with each and every case individually? What are international practices and what is a broader conceptual understanding in our case?It is too early to talk about the working modality but I believe most cases should be dealt with in a representative way. But cases of serious rights violations will enter the prosecution stage. Producing sufficient evidence to prove the crimes, however, will be challenging. For instance, some rape victims may not be able to name the perpetrators. They were raped but couldnât even recognise the perpetrator. In such a case, the state should respect such victims and provide reparation to them. Some complainants may choose not to continue with the cases. Before determining whether certain cases are serious or not, each file has to be checked at least once. So, the commissions need a large number of investigating officers. Field offices need to be set up based on the number and nature of complaints. What kind of involvement of international agencies may be needed for this process?It will certainly need the involvement of international agencies. Nepalâs peace process is basically home-grown but we will also seek support and expertise from international agencies, as we did in the past. We never work in isolation but the areas where we need their support will be decided only after the commissions start their work. We need international experts for certain specialised tasks, such as conducting DNA tests and exhuming bodies buried during the insurgency. The way the international community promptly welcomed the new amendment, it seems that the government and political parties were working in close consultation with them. Is that so?As far as I am informed, everything was done by Nepalis. But there was communication with the international agencies. They had earlier expressed their concerns on the âzero draftâ and the issues have been addressed. Therefore, they promptly welcomed it. They obviously are involved indirectly because it is a matter the international community is closely watching. But now we may need their direct support to carry out certain specialised tasks.Why didnât the amendment even mention the use of child soldiers, crime against humanity and war crime?It is a matter of serious consideration as to whether our cases fall under the definition of serious crimes such as crime against humanity. The commissions will study this aspect as well.Donât you think the provision of reduced sentencing and overlooking of certain legal aspects may promote impunity?Even now, inmates get a waiver of around 50 percent under the regular legal system. So the provision to reduce sentences is already there.But such sentences are reduced only after serving for a certain time and demonstrating good behaviour. Shouldnât we have adopted a similar approach in this case?Transitional justice system should be seen a bit differently. Here, I give you an example. In Colombia, the TRC of the country summoned the seven secretariat members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). They were first briefed about the charges registered against them. They admitted that they committed the crimes. Then, all of them were acquitted because they spoke the truth. The TRC in Colombia gave priority to finding the truth. If someone showed honesty and cooperated in finding the truth they wouldnât be punished. But they increased the penalty for those who tried to mislead them through falsehood.Can we say our process is a bit driven by a reparative approach?I again stress that we should look at the transitional justice process differently than how we look at the retributive justice system. It needs a different law, different court and a different jurisprudence.It takes years of rigorous work to complete this process and firm commitment of major political forces is vital. Frequent changes in coalition and unpredictable relations between the political forces is our reality. Donât you think such instability may hamper this process?This time around, the role of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is very positive. Chiefs of the three biggest parties, while addressing a parliament meeting, have expressed their commitment to make this process successful. Their unity on this matter is important. Not only them, all the political parties represented in the federal parliament, except one lawmaker from a fringe party, have supported this amendment. It has thus become a national issue. I hope this consensus will remain intact while picking officials for the commissions and taking the entire process to a logical end.Given your expertise and involvement in this process, you are being seen as a strong candidate for the TRC chair. What is the reality?I have nothing to say as no one has talked to me about this.

I canât say it is 100 percent because even they [the Supreme Court justices] at the time said âso and soâ should be done on a hypothetical ground as so many things were still evolving. Now, some issues might have become redundant. But most of the things have been addressed. See, first, we should have conceptual clarity. There is a fundamental difference between retributive justice and transitional justice systems. In retributive justice, cases are decided by regular courts based on existing laws while in the transitional justice system we have to look into political, social as well as cultural aspects. This is the internationally accepted approach.The amendment has included a provision of up to 75 percent reduced sentencing. The attorney general, who works for the government, is mandated to recommend this. Isnât this akin to directing the court? Wouldnât it instead be prudent to leave that to the court? If that were not done, there would be mistrust and the process may not have gotten sufficient support from the warring sides of the past. In such a scenario, the process may have again failed. A supportive role of the stakeholders will be crucial. Of late, I often urge the victims to cooperate with the process; otherwise it will remain a never-ending process. Itâs already too late. So, now we should be pragmatic. We should carry out things on a priority basis. Finding and respecting truth are the first and second priorities. The option to go to court is there, if someone wants so. The fourth priority is reparation. The goal is to establish that no one will need to take up arms and resort to violence in Nepal again. Now, most of the stakeholders are positive about concluding this process. The international community has in fact asked us what type of support we need.It is said the role of Desmond Tutu, who led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, was crucial for the success of the countryâs transitional justice process. Do you think the personality of the heads of the commissions will be vital in our case as well?Leadership definitely matters. In Colombia as well, a person of similar stature, who is respected by all sides in the country, led the process. So, the leadership and composition of the commissions will matter. The commissions should be allowed to work and make decisions on their own.There are nearly 64,000 complaints with the TRC and around 2,400 with the CIEDP. How should the commissions carry out their task? Will they deal with each and every case individually? What are international practices and what is a broader conceptual understanding in our case?It is too early to talk about the working modality but I believe most cases should be dealt with in a representative way. But cases of serious rights violations will enter the prosecution stage. Producing sufficient evidence to prove the crimes, however, will be challenging. For instance, some rape victims may not be able to name the perpetrators. They were raped but couldnât even recognise the perpetrator. In such a case, the state should respect such victims and provide reparation to them. Some complainants may choose not to continue with the cases. Before determining whether certain cases are serious or not, each file has to be checked at least once. So, the commissions need a large number of investigating officers. Field offices need to be set up based on the number and nature of complaints. What kind of involvement of international agencies may be needed for this process?It will certainly need the involvement of international agencies. Nepalâs peace process is basically home-grown but we will also seek support and expertise from international agencies, as we did in the past. We never work in isolation but the areas where we need their support will be decided only after the commissions start their work. We need international experts for certain specialised tasks, such as conducting DNA tests and exhuming bodies buried during the insurgency. The way the international community promptly welcomed the new amendment, it seems that the government and political parties were working in close consultation with them. Is that so?As far as I am informed, everything was done by Nepalis. But there was communication with the international agencies. They had earlier expressed their concerns on the âzero draftâ and the issues have been addressed. Therefore, they promptly welcomed it. They obviously are involved indirectly because it is a matter the international community is closely watching. But now we may need their direct support to carry out certain specialised tasks.Why didnât the amendment even mention the use of child soldiers, crime against humanity and war crime?It is a matter of serious consideration as to whether our cases fall under the definition of serious crimes such as crime against humanity. The commissions will study this aspect as well.Donât you think the provision of reduced sentencing and overlooking of certain legal aspects may promote impunity?Even now, inmates get a waiver of around 50 percent under the regular legal system. So the provision to reduce sentences is already there.But such sentences are reduced only after serving for a certain time and demonstrating good behaviour. Shouldnât we have adopted a similar approach in this case?Transitional justice system should be seen a bit differently. Here, I give you an example. In Colombia, the TRC of the country summoned the seven secretariat members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). They were first briefed about the charges registered against them. They admitted that they committed the crimes. Then, all of them were acquitted because they spoke the truth. The TRC in Colombia gave priority to finding the truth. If someone showed honesty and cooperated in finding the truth they wouldnât be punished. But they increased the penalty for those who tried to mislead them through falsehood.Can we say our process is a bit driven by a reparative approach?I again stress that we should look at the transitional justice process differently than how we look at the retributive justice system. It needs a different law, different court and a different jurisprudence.It takes years of rigorous work to complete this process and firm commitment of major political forces is vital. Frequent changes in coalition and unpredictable relations between the political forces is our reality. Donât you think such instability may hamper this process?This time around, the role of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is very positive. Chiefs of the three biggest parties, while addressing a parliament meeting, have expressed their commitment to make this process successful. Their unity on this matter is important. Not only them, all the political parties represented in the federal parliament, except one lawmaker from a fringe party, have supported this amendment. It has thus become a national issue. I hope this consensus will remain intact while picking officials for the commissions and taking the entire process to a logical end.Given your expertise and involvement in this process, you are being seen as a strong candidate for the TRC chair. What is the reality?I have nothing to say as no one has talked to me about this.

Palesha Goverdhan clinched Nepalâs maiden Olympics-level medal in Paris early on Saturday, sending ripples of excitement and hope across her homeland. Goverdhan seemed destined for success given her stellar track record in international meets over the past few years. Four years ago, Goverdhan, who entered the Tokyo Paralympic Games on a wildcard, had also qualified for the bronze medal final but had lost the bout. Two years later, at the Asian Para Games 2022 in Hangzhou, China, Goverdhan won a medal. She then became the first Nepali paralympian to qualify for the Paralympic Games. And now the 21-year-old has delivered on the biggest stage. After Goverdhanâs victory, her coach Kabi Raj Negi Lama rightly said that his charge had shattered the assumption that a Nepali could never win an Olympic medal. Yet it had appeared that way only a fortnight ago when none of the seven Nepali athletes who took part in the Paris Summer Olympics could create much of an impact. The usual suspects were blamed for their failure: Nepalâs poor sporting infrastructures, paucity of high-level practice, lack of professionalism, etc. Nepal, it seemed, would have to wait for a long time for Olympics success. That was until Goverdhan bagged the taekwondo bronze at the Paris Paralympics. This sends a vital message to other Nepali athletes as well as the Nepali state. One, as coach Lama hinted, Goverdhanâs medal breaks down the psychological barrier that a Nepali cannot succeed at the highest level. There is no inherent reason Nepali athletes or para-athletes cannot make their mark if they get the right kind of state support. Concomitantly, the message that a woman with a disability can capture her countryâs attention and bring it international fame is no less important in what is still a patriarchal society. Nepali female athletes are world class, as the countryâs women football and cricket teams have repeatedly shown. With a little more impetus, the skyâs the limit of what they can achieve. Goverdhanâs success is also an example of long-term thinking. After her failure to win a medal in Tokyo, Goverdhan pushed herself hard in the following years, and much of the time after that was spent preparing for the next Parlalympics. This suggests that Nepal would do well to start investing for success at Los Angeles 2028 right now as a part of the countryâs long term sporting vision. There have of late been some positive gestures from the Nepali state. For instance, this yearâs policies and programmes promises fellowships to 1,000 talented youths in various fields, including in sports. There will be special focus on cultivating women athletes. Similarly, various incentives and allowances have also been declared for the Nepali sports stars who achieve international success. There is also a new emphasis on building new stadiums and upgrading existing ones. If all these schemes materialise, greater international sporting success for Nepal will be guaranteed. This is crucial. Nepali youths are desperate for home-grown international idols, whose success inspires and is worthy of emulation. If they see their peers compete and even win against the best in the world, their ambitions will soar. This in turn will boost the morale of their country. As we have repeatedly seen, international sporting success is a glue that binds this diverse country closer. The more, the merrier.Â  ","summary":"The 60-year-old jinx has finally been broken.

He had only hazy memories of his family and home in Jhapa, and his real nameâKale Tamang. The Herne Katha team soon began tracing his footsteps back to Jhapa. Along the journey, Pakaâs memories of his childhood, his family and his home came back alive in bits and pieces.

On the eighth day of its premiere, as âThe Lost Yearsâ had reached 8.7 million views on YouTube, Paka had risen as a folk hero and the Herne Katha team garnered accolades and criticisms aplenty. A curious mixture of his destiny and Herne Kathaâs storytelling helped him find home. But long after Herne Katha stopped rolling, his story continues to unravel. From a story, he is slowly metamorphosing into a content as he is being pushed towards uncharted territories. The return from social media-fed stardom to reality is rather troublesome and tragicâas we have seen in the case of the young Sachin Pariyar.

As YouTubers seek newness in their content, Paka will be encouraged to fabricate his hardships and seek financial supportâthings he had hardly ever done before. In no time, having repeated the fabrications on camera umpteen times, he will learn to believe them, even become obsessed with them. Questions about the inconsistencies in his plotline will follow, and he will have to supplement fabrications with lies. In no time, Paka will have lost touch with his story. Unless another good samaritan jumps in to save Paka from the viral infection of social media-driven stardom, this is more or less his trajectory in the next few weeks. There are some tell-tale signs of Pakaâs downfall already: His parents have already started crying in front of YouTubers; his brother has already started reciting stale chutkilas; local politicians have offered him land to build a home; provincial and federal government representatives have promised to help him; and the common public have begun garlanding him and offering him money. The man who had mastered the art of living in the mountains will soon be tutored in the art of lying in front of the camera. Negotiating the journey from innocence to experience is often more difficult than spending cold winter nights in the company of yaks and sheep. Finding home should never be accompanied by the loss of self, but that is what happens when the story loses its plot. The spectacleThe history of the media is a story of fabrications. Folklores and myths, poetry and prose, or stories and reels, all depend on some bit of fabrication by the media that bear themâoral, visual, or tactile.

But Paka's story is quickly becoming a public spectacle, and there is a risk of him losing his very being.Â Â  "},{"hash":"fd52235d9573424ba2be2dbb16c1f44997e5d63ce09774108bde9a29f0073e00","title":"dismal-narratives-of-education","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/08/31/dismal-narratives-of-education","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/Leadpostfile-1725074027.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1725062400000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"The dismal narratives of higher education in particular and the education system in general that regularly come out these days make me pensive.

Imageries of death and funeral for educational karma are used in some articles. The stories of political appointments to fill up some regular educational posts at the university find great publicity.

Narratives of physical attacks, fulminations and vengeance are rife.This story of the NC-UML binary in education creates doubt about the honesty and pragmatism in education propagated by political parties. The general public has even begun to question the seriousness of political alliances in bringing a state of order, standard and decency to the educational system. Politicising education through party interference is already established as a hegemonic practice in Nepal.

The Nepali educational system, especially at the tertiary level, clearly shows this.The other side of realityI have spent most of my life working in the field of pedagogy, research and related engagements at the tertiary level. People like me and those with similar experiences have worked under different conditions of politics and transformations, hopes and obscurantism. I am still working, if not regularly, as a teacher and supervisor of studentsâ research work. I attend the students' forums and present my views on theories and cultural studies. Some students are doing their PhD under my tutelage. I have a long experience working with students both at and outside the Kirtipur campus. A certain enduring sense of being a teacher under different conditions of inspiration and pragmatism still guides my sense of working in education. Being a politically conscious person and one who worked with political ideologies even as a student in the past, I do not want to sound naÃ¯ve in politics and education. I am familiar with the works and plans of students who espouse various ideological camps summed up by such nomenclature as the Nepali Congress, UML, Maoists and even the erstwhile Panchayat system.To take one recent and eloquent example, I was watching the news of the launch of a book named Nakabandi ra Bhurajniti, written by my former student Kamal Thapa, with Prime Minister KP Oli as the chief guest the other day. Kamal has penned his experience representing and defending Nepal's new republican constitution at a meeting in Geneva while working as Nepal's foreign minister. He had not even fully accepted the constitution then. I do not agree with Kamal's political ideas, but this example suggests that students' political engagements and teachers' free relationships do not necessarily end with their ideological followings. I have a long experience of this nature. This requires a more extended discussion with theories and experience. As a teacher, I can say that students' political interests and associations are natural. The claims that students have destroyed the education system by their different views are hard to accept. As the news and commentaries criticise, they have not dragged education to a point of no return. We should also see this side of reality: Students write good dissertations, research papers, essays and rhetorical texts; they read books and magazines in print and online.

From the icy wilderness of Alaska to the sunny shores of the Caribbean, these legendary land transactions reveal how strategic decisions shaped the world we know today. Letâs take a journey through some of the largest and most influential real estate deals in history. One of the most significant land purchases ever made was the Alaska Purchase in 1867. In what many at the time deemed a foolish move, the US bought Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million, which amounted to just two cents per acre.Critics labelled it âSewardâs Follyâ after then Secretary of State William H. Seward, who had championed the deal. To most Americans, Alaska was an inhospitable, frozen wasteland with little practical value. However, history would soon reveal how wrong that perception was. Alaska, which eventually became the 49th state of the US, turned out to be rich in resources. Today, the state supplies around 20 percent of the petroleum needed by the US and is home to vast reserves of gold, diamonds and other minerals. Its stunning natural landscapes and abundant wildlife have also made it a top destination for adventure-seeking tourists. The purchase not only secured valuable resources but also expanded Americaâs influence in the Asia-Pacific region. But why did Russia sell such a vast and resource-rich territory? The answer lies in the aftermath of the Crimean War.Faced with financial strain and the threat of another costly conflict with Britain, Russia decided it was better to sell Alaska than risk losing it in a future war. More than a century later, some Russians still lament this decision, believing Alaska should have remained part of their country. In todayâs market, the land alone could be valued at over $37 billion, making it one of the greatest bargains in history. What was once seen as a foolish investment is now considered one of the smartest geopolitical moves ever made. Another colossal real estate deal occurred in 1803, when the US acquired the Louisiana Territory from France.The Louisiana Purchase nearly doubled the size of the young nation, adding approximately 828,000 square miles of land. This massive acquisition was negotiated by President Thomas Jefferson, who saw it as crucial for Americaâs expansion. The price? A mere $15 million, or roughly four cents per acre. Franceâs leader at the time, Napoleon Bonaparte, was eager to sell the territory because he needed funds to support his military campaigns in Europe, especially his on-going conflict with Spain. By selling the Louisiana Territory, Napoleon not only gained much-needed revenue but also rid himself of land he considered difficult to defend. For the US, the deal was a strategic game changer. It secured American control over the Mississippi River and paved the way for westward expansion, which would define much of the countryâs future.Today, the land acquired in the Louisiana Purchase includes 15 states, from Louisiana in the south to Montana in the north. Its value is now estimated at over $100 billion, making it another historic example of how visionary leadership can transform a nationâs fortunes. While the Alaska and Louisiana purchases are well-known, another historic agreement that shaped global land distribution was the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494. This treaty, signed by Spain and Portugal, essentially divided the world between the two rising superpowers.Brokered by the Pope, the agreement drew an imaginary line down the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Lands to the west of this line, including most of the Americas, were claimed by Spain, while lands to the east, including parts of Africa and Asia, were designated for Portugal. This division of the world laid the foundation for centuries of exploration, conquest, and colonization by these two nations. Portugal focused on expanding its empire in Africa, India, and Brazil, while Spainâs influence spread across the Americas. The wealth generated from these colonial empires was staggering, built largely on the resources and labour extracted from the lands they controlled.However, by the late 19th century, both empires had begun to crumble as their colonies gained independence or were taken over by other European powers. The treaty that once defined global power dynamics became obsolete as new empires like Britain, France and the US emerged. In the early 20th century, yet another important land deal took place that was driven by strategic considerations.As World War I raged across Europe, the US purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917 for $25 million. President Woodrow Wilson initiated the deal out of concern that Germany might seize control of these islands, which would have posed a serious threat to American national security. The Virgin Islands are strategically located along key maritime routes between the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, making them a valuable asset for controlling naval movements in the region. Besides their strategic importance, the Virgin Islands have also become a major tourist destination, boosting the local and national economy.The purchase not only secured Americaâs presence in the Caribbean but also prevented a potential wartime disaster, proving that sometimes the value of land lies in its location rather than its resources. These monumental real estate transactions reveal some common themes. First, strategic foresight is key. Whether it was acquiring Alaska or purchasing the Louisiana Territory, these deals were driven by leaders who understood that the immediate costs would be outweighed by long-term benefits.Second, timing matters. Many of these purchases were made during times of crisis, when the sellers were in desperate need of money. Russia needed funds after the Crimean War, Napoleon was seeking revenue to fuel his European campaigns and Denmark sold the Virgin Islands as it faced the threat of German expansion. Moreover, the true value of land often is not immediately apparent. What was once seen as a frozen wasteland or swampy territory has turned out to be resource-rich and strategically vital. These deals also had significant geopolitical consequences, reshaping the balance of power across continents and cementing the status of emerging superpowers.In conclusion, the worldâs largest real estate deals were not just about land; they were about power, vision, and strategy. From Alaskaâs oil reserves to the geopolitical importance of the Virgin Islands, these transactions continue to influence global politics and economics. They stand as testaments to the power of visionary leadership and the lasting impact of seemingly simple decisions about buying and selling land. âLand is the only thing in the world that amounts to anything, for âtis the only thing in this world that lasts.â âMargaret Mitchell, Gone with the Wind.âThe Statesman (India)/ANN ","summary":"Throughout history, some real estate deals have not just changed borders they have rewritten the course of empires and reshaped global power dynamics.

It promised public hospitals better security equipment, female guards to support female physicians and controlled entry points, according to an internal government memo seen by Reuters.None of these measures had been implemented at the public hospital where a young female doctor was sexually assaulted and killed on Aug. 9, allegedly by a police volunteer, four trainee doctors there told Reuters.Instead, in the days leading up to the homicide-assault, which prompted nationwide outrage and a doctors strike, only two male guards manned R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital, they said. They were supplemented by a few closed circuit cameras that did not comprehensively cover the sprawling premises, according to the trainees.One of the doors of the lecture hall where the doctor had been resting during a 36-hour shift when she was attacked had no lock, said two other trainee doctors who had also slept there. The air conditioning in the designated break room had malfunctioned, they said.After two doctors at a different hospital were assaulted by a patientâs relatives in 2019, West Bengal had promised to install âeffective security equipment and systems,â regulate entry and exit to hospital premises and create a compensation policy for assaulted staff, according to the state health department memo dated June 17, 2019.The two-page document, which is reported by Reuters for the first time, was prepared after chief minister Mamata Banerjee met that day with trainee doctors protesting the attack on their colleagues as a ârecord noteâ of the interaction. The memo did not state to whom it was addressed.Banerjee had directed officials to take âeffective and promptâ action âwithin a specified timeframe,â according to the document. It did not detail the preparation period.âIf those measures had been taken, this incident may never have happened,â said Dr Riya Bera, a postgraduate trainee at R.G. Kar, of her colleagueâs death.Asked by Reuters about the 2019 assurances, West Bengal Health Secretary N S Nigam said the COVID-19 pandemic had disrupted improvements for two years but âa lotâ had been done since 2021, including strengthening CCTV coverage and engaging private security in hospitals.âWe are committed to do the remaining work and fill the gaps that emerged after the R.G. Kar incident,â he said.Banerjee on Aug. 28 also announced that $12 million would be spent to begin work on improvements such as better lighting in health facilities, resting spaces and female security staff.The chief ministerâs office, as well as R.G. Kar hospital, did not respond to calls seeking comment.Authorities continue to investigate the Aug. 9 incident, for which no charges have yet been filed.âPatriarchal attitudes and biasesâThe assault on the doctor in Kolkata, who cannot be named under local laws, recalled memories of the 2012 gang rape of a physiotherapist in a Delhi bus, which convulsed India in anger and triggered protests.Reuters interviewed 14 female doctors at government hospitals in West Bengal and elsewhere in India about their challenges in a country where womenâs safety is a long-standing concern.They described poor working conditions, including aggressive treatment from the families of patients and having to sleep on benches in dimly-lit corridors due to a lack of rest facilities.Some doctors spoke of napping in break rooms with no locks during lengthy shifts, only to have people barging in. Others described confronting male patients who photographed them without permission, claiming that they were documenting evidence of their treatment.Indian Medical Association (IMA) President RV Asokan told Reuters that while the Aug. 9 homicide-assault appeared to be unique in its brutality, âthe fact that anybody can walk in shows the vulnerability of the place, and this when more and more women are joining the profession.âSome doctors have taken self-defense measures: One doctor at a hospital in Odisha state, which neighbours West Bengal, said her father gave her a knife to ward off potential attackers.And Dr Gauri Seth, a post graduate trainee at Medical College, Kolkata, told Reuters that after the Aug 9. incident, she would not go on duty again without carrying a pepper spray or scalpel to defend herself.About 60% of Indiaâs doctors are female, and three-quarters of them have described being victims of verbal abuse, physical attacks and other harassment while on duty, according to the IMA, the nationâs largest group of physicians.âDue to ingrained patriarchal attitudes and biases, relatives of patients are more likely to challenge women medical professionals...(they) also face different forms of sexual violence at the workplace,â Indiaâs Supreme Court wrote in a Aug. 20 ruling ordering the creation of a taskforce on medical workersâ safety.India introduced tough laws governing crimes against women following the 2012 Delhi gang rape, including expanding the definition of rape to include all penetration without consent, as well as criminalizing voyeurism and stalking.But the situation remains bleak, according to activists and government data.Almost 450,000 crimes against women were reported in 2022 - the most recent year for which data is available - up 4% on 2021, government data show. More than 7% of the alleged crimes were rape-related.Lawyer and rights activist Vrinda Grover blamed inadequate training for police investigators and broader cultural issues.âWhat is very disturbing in this case is the ordinariness of what the victim was doing: she was in her workplace,â she said. âThere is something wrong with a society where such conduct is so commonplace.âLiving her dreamThe 31-year Kolkata physician, whose battered, half-naked body was found by colleagues, had always wanted to be a doctor, family members and friends told Reuters.âWhen I bumped into her last year, she told me she was very happy and was living her dream,â said Somojit Moulik, who had studied with the victim in medical school.When Reuters visited the victimâs family home, the nameplate bore only her name with the prefix Dr, in an indication of how highly her relatives valued her achievements.Her aunt said in an interview that her niece had been set to marry a physician she had studied with later this year, and that she had not complained about safety issues at work.But in the wake of her death, colleagues are speaking out. Dr Shreya Shaw, a postgraduate trainee at R.G. Kar hospital, said she found two strangers shaking her awake at around 3 a.m. when she was sleeping in a designated rest room, which did not have locks.âIt was initially quite scary to wake up to unknown men in the dark,â she said, adding that she was shocked the patients could enter the floor where she was resting without being stopped.

The memo did not state to whom it was addressed.Banerjee had directed officials to take âeffective and promptâ action âwithin a specified timeframe,â according to the document. It did not detail the preparation period.âIf those measures had been taken, this incident may never have happened,â said Dr Riya Bera, a postgraduate trainee at R.G. Kar, of her colleagueâs death.Asked by Reuters about the 2019 assurances, West Bengal Health Secretary N S Nigam said the COVID-19 pandemic had disrupted improvements for two years but âa lotâ had been done since 2021, including strengthening CCTV coverage and engaging private security in hospitals.âWe are committed to do the remaining work and fill the gaps that emerged after the R.G. Kar incident,â he said.Banerjee on Aug. 28 also announced that $12 million would be spent to begin work on improvements such as better lighting in health facilities, resting spaces and female security staff.The chief ministerâs office, as well as R.G. Kar hospital, did not respond to calls seeking comment.Authorities continue to investigate the Aug. 9 incident, for which no charges have yet been filed.âPatriarchal attitudes and biasesâThe assault on the doctor in Kolkata, who cannot be named under local laws, recalled memories of the 2012 gang rape of a physiotherapist in a Delhi bus, which convulsed India in anger and triggered protests.Reuters interviewed 14 female doctors at government hospitals in West Bengal and elsewhere in India about their challenges in a country where womenâs safety is a long-standing concern.They described poor working conditions, including aggressive treatment from the families of patients and having to sleep on benches in dimly-lit corridors due to a lack of rest facilities.Some doctors spoke of napping in break rooms with no locks during lengthy shifts, only to have people barging in. Others described confronting male patients who photographed them without permission, claiming that they were documenting evidence of their treatment.Indian Medical Association (IMA) President RV Asokan told Reuters that while the Aug. 9 homicide-assault appeared to be unique in its brutality, âthe fact that anybody can walk in shows the vulnerability of the place, and this when more and more women are joining the profession.âSome doctors have taken self-defense measures: One doctor at a hospital in Odisha state, which neighbours West Bengal, said her father gave her a knife to ward off potential attackers.And Dr Gauri Seth, a post graduate trainee at Medical College, Kolkata, told Reuters that after the Aug 9. incident, she would not go on duty again without carrying a pepper spray or scalpel to defend herself.About 60% of Indiaâs doctors are female, and three-quarters of them have described being victims of verbal abuse, physical attacks and other harassment while on duty, according to the IMA, the nationâs largest group of physicians.âDue to ingrained patriarchal attitudes and biases, relatives of patients are more likely to challenge women medical professionals...(they) also face different forms of sexual violence at the workplace,â Indiaâs Supreme Court wrote in a Aug. 20 ruling ordering the creation of a taskforce on medical workersâ safety.India introduced tough laws governing crimes against women following the 2012 Delhi gang rape, including expanding the definition of rape to include all penetration without consent, as well as criminalizing voyeurism and stalking.But the situation remains bleak, according to activists and government data.Almost 450,000 crimes against women were reported in 2022 - the most recent year for which data is available - up 4% on 2021, government data show. More than 7% of the alleged crimes were rape-related.Lawyer and rights activist Vrinda Grover blamed inadequate training for police investigators and broader cultural issues.âWhat is very disturbing in this case is the ordinariness of what the victim was doing: she was in her workplace,â she said. âThere is something wrong with a society where such conduct is so commonplace.âLiving her dreamThe 31-year Kolkata physician, whose battered, half-naked body was found by colleagues, had always wanted to be a doctor, family members and friends told Reuters.âWhen I bumped into her last year, she told me she was very happy and was living her dream,â said Somojit Moulik, who had studied with the victim in medical school.When Reuters visited the victimâs family home, the nameplate bore only her name with the prefix Dr, in an indication of how highly her relatives valued her achievements.Her aunt said in an interview that her niece had been set to marry a physician she had studied with later this year, and that she had not complained about safety issues at work.But in the wake of her death, colleagues are speaking out. Dr Shreya Shaw, a postgraduate trainee at R.G. Kar hospital, said she found two strangers shaking her awake at around 3 a.m. when she was sleeping in a designated rest room, which did not have locks.âIt was initially quite scary to wake up to unknown men in the dark,â she said, adding that she was shocked the patients could enter the floor where she was resting without being stopped.

The proposals are being discussed at the partyâs central working committee meeting.The partyâs central working committee is scheduled to meet on Sunday to seek a consensus on the proposals. The meeting will approve Thapaâs proposal with some minor changes while Sharmaâs paper will be pushed back, to be taken up while amending the constitution, party leaders say. The bone of contention is holding the partyâs 15th general convention as per the schedule.During the Mahasamiti meeting in February, General Secretary Gagan Thapa proposed that the party should not forge any political alliance for the 2027 general and provincial elections but should contest the polls on its own.The meeting endorsed the proposal and forwarded it to the central working committee for further consideration and a final decision.At the same meeting, the partyâs other general secretary, Bishwa Prakash Sharma, had proposed an âexit policyâ for senior leaders, recommending term limits: one term for the [nationâs] President, two terms for prime minister, three terms for ministers, and four terms for lawmakers.Both Sharmaâs and Thapaâs proposals were thoroughly discussed at the partyâs central working committee meeting that began on August 7.Many members close to party president Sher Bahadur Deuba opposed Sharmaâs âexit policyâ, and there was considerable dissent over Thapaâs proposal to avoid electoral alliances.The proposals forwarded by the Mahasamiti meeting sparked heated debate in the central working committee. The establishment faction led by Deuba wants to amend the proposals, while Thapa and Sharma want endorsement of their proposals without any changes.To discuss these proposals, the party called a meeting of the central working committee beginning August 7, where the members were sharply divided.In order to seek a common ground and to prevent any dispute, Deuba, the party president, kept on reaching out to top leadership as well as Thapa and Sharma multiple times. On Saturday, too, senior leaders like Bimalendra Nidhi, Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar, and others opposed Sharma's proposal saying that a democratic party should not shut the door for competition. However, Sharma has a different take and says people have been frustrated at seeing the same old faces in national politics. Sharma told the Post that since the exit policy is linked with the constitutional provision, it will be discussed during the time of reviewing the constitution and an appropriate decision taken. \"The proposal to limit the prime ministerial job for two terms will be endorsed by Sunday's meeting. This policy decision will be approved by consensus. No matter how famous the prime minister, he or she cannot serve for more than two terms,\" Sharma claimed. In an agreement signed before the formation of the current government, the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML have committed to reviewing certain provisions of the constitution, drawing on the lessons from nearly a decade of federal exercise.On Thapa's proposal, Sundayâs meeting will decide that all of the party's supporters and well-wishers will vote for the party's symbol \"tree\" in the next elections without mentioning electoral alliances. However, leaders close to Deuba say that decisions on electoral alliances are strategic and should be left until the election time. Thapa's proposal will be approved with amendments, said Shyam Ghimire, the chief whip of the party. Sharmaâs proposal will be kept as it is and will be raised during the time of constitutional amendments. Both general secretaries have established their agendas in the party, a central committee member said. The debate has generated good response inside and outside the party.Both general secretaries have also put enough pressure on Deuba to ensure that the party's upcoming 15th general convention should convene on time.During the central working committee meeting in February, Thapa had proposed holding the 15th general convention on scheduleâor by mid-December 2025. The general convention elects the party new leadership. Thapa has already proposed a timeline for the general convention, but the party has yet to take a decision.The 14th general convention was held in December 2021. The party charter gives each elected body a tenure of four years. But if the general convention could not occur within four years, the charter provisions a one-year extension. Further, Nepalâs constitution authorises a six-month deferral if a situation of emergency makes holding the convention difficult.At the central working committee meeting, Congress members were divided on whether to amend and approve the proposal or reject it outright. Deuba has been talking to Congress office bearers over the last few days, but there has been no progress. âNow we cannot wait beyond Sunday as the party has to gear up for several other works,â Congress leaders said.

This policy decision will be approved by consensus. No matter how famous the prime minister, he or she cannot serve for more than two terms,\" Sharma claimed. In an agreement signed before the formation of the current government, the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML have committed to reviewing certain provisions of the constitution, drawing on the lessons from nearly a decade of federal exercise.On Thapa's proposal, Sundayâs meeting will decide that all of the party's supporters and well-wishers will vote for the party's symbol \"tree\" in the next elections without mentioning electoral alliances. However, leaders close to Deuba say that decisions on electoral alliances are strategic and should be left until the election time. Thapa's proposal will be approved with amendments, said Shyam Ghimire, the chief whip of the party. Sharmaâs proposal will be kept as it is and will be raised during the time of constitutional amendments. Both general secretaries have established their agendas in the party, a central committee member said. The debate has generated good response inside and outside the party.Both general secretaries have also put enough pressure on Deuba to ensure that the party's upcoming 15th general convention should convene on time.During the central working committee meeting in February, Thapa had proposed holding the 15th general convention on scheduleâor by mid-December 2025. The general convention elects the party new leadership. Thapa has already proposed a timeline for the general convention, but the party has yet to take a decision.The 14th general convention was held in December 2021. The party charter gives each elected body a tenure of four years. But if the general convention could not occur within four years, the charter provisions a one-year extension. Further, Nepalâs constitution authorises a six-month deferral if a situation of emergency makes holding the convention difficult.At the central working committee meeting, Congress members were divided on whether to amend and approve the proposal or reject it outright. Deuba has been talking to Congress office bearers over the last few days, but there has been no progress. âNow we cannot wait beyond Sunday as the party has to gear up for several other works,â Congress leaders said.

Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.âBhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Groupâs Bhaktapur branch. âThe destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.âThe Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the cityâs post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.âThere was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,â says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. âThe encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.âAfter 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this yearâs Indra Jatra.âItâs challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasnât been seen in a century,â Shakya notes. âAs a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapurâs revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakheâs mask.â Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.âAs for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,â says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.âBecoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,â said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. âWe must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.âTo Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.âThe dance will not only bolster Bhaktapurâs cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,â says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. âEconomic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,â Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.âThe Lakhe dance wonât let them separate,â Shakya remarks.In todayâs globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging.

Harnessing waste biomass could cut the countryâs carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by up to 52 percent and meet up to 12 percent of current energy consumption, according to the paper entitled âPossibilities and challenges for converting waste biomass into fuel, feed, and fertiliser in Nepalâ.Most of Nepalâs waste biomass is used conventionally, such as for kitchen fuel and animal feed, without proper valorisation. This is a pressing issue as open dumping and burning, particularly of municipal waste, is a common practice in Nepal, according to the paper, with detrimental effects on the overall ecosystem.âOur study estimates the potential of about 89 million tonnes of waste biomass annually in Nepal, mainly from the agriculture, municipal, livestock, fowl, and human sectors,â said Sagar Kafle, assistant professor at the Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University.âWe have revealed the potential at the sub-national level in Nepal, highlighting its possibilities and challenges for converting the fuel, feed, and fertilisers,â said Kafle, who is currently pursuing PhD at Auburn University, US.The paper estimates that through the conversion of waste biomass, Nepal can produce about 1.7 to 5.0 million tonnes of pellet or briquette and biochar, 1.7 to 5.1 million tonnes of feed block, 129 to 387 million cubic metres of biogas, and 0.6 to 1.9 million tonnes of fertiliser.âThese valuable products can have significant environmental and economic benefits,â the paper said.Waste biomass is generated from different sources, such as forestry residue, agriculture crop residue, municipal organic waste, and livestock waste. Improper management of such residue and waste negatively impacts overall biodiversity, a growing global concern. For example, the poor handling and management of municipal solid waste, mainly generated from the urban sector, pollutes the surroundings and impacts overall biodiversity, including human health. Its management is one of the significant challenges for the relevant authorities, as it needs resources.Municipal solid waste, comprising more than half of organic waste in developing countries, is being dumped and burned openly in Nepal.Similarly, open burning of crop residues, especially paddy straw, is practised in Nepal, resulting in air pollution. This practice is particularly prominent in the Tarai, where combined harvesters scatter straw across the fields, making collection impractical. Farmers often burn the straw as they find it economically unviable to collect and meet the next cropping season. Livestock manures generate methane during decomposition, contributing to global warming.

","summary":"Nepal has huge waste potential for biomass, a resource that can significantly boost the economy if correctly managed and valorised, according to a new research paper. Harnessing waste biomass could cut the countryâs carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by up to 52 percent and meet up to 12 percent of current energy consumption, according to the paper entitled âPossibilities and challenges for converting waste biomass into fuel, feed, and fertiliser in Nepalâ.Most of Nepalâs waste biomass is used conventionally, such as for kitchen fuel and animal feed, without proper valorisation. This is a pressing issue as open dumping and burning, particularly of municipal waste, is a common practice in Nepal, according to the paper, with detrimental effects on the overall ecosystem.âOur study estimates the potential of about 89 million tonnes of waste biomass annually in Nepal, mainly from the agriculture, municipal, livestock, fowl, and human sectors,â said Sagar Kafle, assistant professor at the Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University.âWe have revealed the potential at the sub-national level in Nepal, highlighting its possibilities and challenges for converting the fuel, feed, and fertilisers,â said Kafle, who is currently pursuing PhD at Auburn University, US.The paper estimates that through the conversion of waste biomass, Nepal can produce about 1.7 to 5.0 million tonnes of pellet or briquette and biochar, 1.7 to 5.1 million tonnes of feed block, 129 to 387 million cubic metres of biogas, and 0.6 to 1.9 million tonnes of fertiliser.âThese valuable products can have significant environmental and economic benefits,â the paper said.Waste biomass is generated from different sources, such as forestry residue, agriculture crop residue, municipal organic waste, and livestock waste. Improper management of such residue and waste negatively impacts overall biodiversity, a growing global concern. For example, the poor handling and management of municipal solid waste, mainly generated from the urban sector, pollutes the surroundings and impacts overall biodiversity, including human health. Its management is one of the significant challenges for the relevant authorities, as it needs resources.Municipal solid waste, comprising more than half of organic waste in developing countries, is being dumped and burned openly in Nepal.Similarly, open burning of crop residues, especially paddy straw, is practised in Nepal, resulting in air pollution. This practice is particularly prominent in the Tarai, where combined harvesters scatter straw across the fields, making collection impractical. Farmers often burn the straw as they find it economically unviable to collect and meet the next cropping season. Livestock manures generate methane during decomposition, contributing to global warming. However, anaerobic digestion technology could trap and utilise this gas as energy.Also, improper management of human wasteâurine and faecesâpollutes soil and groundwater, affecting human health. Although the country has declared itself free from open defecation, dumping raw sewage and septic tank waste into rivers is common in Nepal. Due to the lack of proper conversion knowledge and technology and the unavailability of status data, the waste biomass is improperly managed or conventionally used in many developing countries.

It spreads in humans when bitten by infected chiggers (larval mites) found in mice.Until a few years ago, it was believed that people residing in rural areas or those working in grasslands or fields were at high risk. However, urban populations are also now being affected by the disease.âOver 100 people from Hetauda Sub-metropolitan city have been infected from Scrub typhus this year,â said Krishna Bahadur Major, chief of the Health Office, Makawanpur. âAlthough more cases are reported in villages, urban areas are not immune, with several positive cases emerging there as well.âDoctors point out high fever, headache, abdominal pain, backache, joint and muscle pain, red rash, nausea and vomiting as some of the symptoms of scrub typhus infection. Patients with severe illness may develop bleeding which could lead to organ failure. The infection can lead to respiratory distress, inflation of brain, lungs, kidney failure and then multi-organ failure. If not treated immediately, it could be fatal.Nepal saw a surge in scrub typhus cases after the calamitous 2015 earthquakes that killed nearly 9,000 persons across the country.Three months after the quakes, the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, alerted the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division about six children with unusual fevers and severe respiratory problems.Serum samples were collected for subsequent tests in Kathmandu and Bangkok, which confirmed a scrub typhus outbreak. By then, four children had already died in the course of the treatment. By the end of the year, 101 cases were confirmed in 16 districts, and four more people succumbed to the disease.The magnitude of the outbreak escalated in 2016 when 831 cases of scrub typhus were reported in 47 districts, and 14 people died by the end of that year.According to the Ministry of Health and Population data, more than 1,026 people were infected with the disease in 2020. Their number increased to 1,999 in 2021, and it rose to more than 2,900 in 2022.In 2023, over 5,000 people were infected with the deadly disease. Doctors say the risk of severity and fatality can be minimised if the patients are diagnosed and treated early, they say.Ordinary antibiotics, such as doxycycline and azithromycin, which are on the essential drugs list supplied by the government to health facilities across the country for free distribution, can cure the disease.However, what is concerning is that many health workers, including doctors, lack sufficient knowledge about diagnosing scrub typhus. Many health facilities also lack reagents to carry out tests for the disease.Doctors can diagnose the disease based on the symptoms, but the risk of misdiagnosis is high, as scrub typhus symptoms are similar to those of other illnesses. They warn that waiting for lab results before starting treatment could be dangerous. It can take about a week to get lab results, and by that time, if the patient is not treated can fall into a coma and suffer multi-organ failure. ","summary":"Over 3,500 people across the country have been infected with scrub typhus since mid-July, the start of this fiscal year.Officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division say they expect more cases in the coming days as the disease typically peaks in September.âLike in previous years, hundreds of people have also been infected with scrub typhus this year,â said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of vector Control Section at the division. âMore people can get infected in the coming days, as the peak season is still ahead.âScrub typhus, or bush typhus, is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Orientia tsutsugamushi, a mite-borne bacterium. It spreads in humans when bitten by infected chiggers (larval mites) found in mice.Until a few years ago, it was believed that people residing in rural areas or those working in grasslands or fields were at high risk. However, urban populations are also now being affected by the disease.âOver 100 people from Hetauda Sub-metropolitan city have been infected from Scrub typhus this year,â said Krishna Bahadur Major, chief of the Health Office, Makawanpur. âAlthough more cases are reported in villages, urban areas are not immune, with several positive cases emerging there as well.âDoctors point out high fever, headache, abdominal pain, backache, joint and muscle pain, red rash, nausea and vomiting as some of the symptoms of scrub typhus infection. Patients with severe illness may develop bleeding which could lead to organ failure. The infection can lead to respiratory distress, inflation of brain, lungs, kidney failure and then multi-organ failure.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I donât know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allenâs bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didnât have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesnât release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just rightânot too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. Itâs crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the bakerâs repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call âBliss Browniesâ.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugarÂ½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessityâa space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an âoasisâ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. Itâs a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.âIn developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,â says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyoneâqueer and non-queer alikeâto share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.âI didnât want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,â Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikariâs identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. âAt first, I didnât understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,â Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding oneâs identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldnât afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.âDuring my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,â Adhikari says.âThe time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.âFour years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the cafÃ© because of its welcoming atmosphere.âItâs heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like âDahi Chiura Khane din,ââ she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. âI hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I donât think weâd have any other place to turn to,â she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, âThis is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesnât exist here. Itâs where even those who arenât accepted at home can feel accepted.âSahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmanduâs first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. âAs an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge.

We are all human,â he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.âLike how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,â he says. ","summary":"In a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessityâa space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an âoasisâ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. Itâs a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.âIn developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,â says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyoneâqueer and non-queer alikeâto share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.âI didnât want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,â Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikariâs identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. âAt first, I didnât understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,â Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding oneâs identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldnât afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.âDuring my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,â Adhikari says.âThe time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.âFour years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the cafÃ© because of its welcoming atmosphere.âItâs heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like âDahi Chiura Khane din,ââ she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. âI hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I donât think weâd have any other place to turn to,â she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, âThis is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesnât exist here. Itâs where even those who arenât accepted at home can feel accepted.âSahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmanduâs first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. âAs an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.âThe welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the cafÃ© and appreciates the importance of such spaces.âPreviously, I didnât know much about the queer community and didnât care much.

Yet, pockets of the past remainâsmall, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in todayâs Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hourâs walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokanaâs historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the âKhokana Museumâ. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the areaâs history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean waterâa practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.Â  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot âAbout Dry Grassesâ, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happeningâto what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time.

Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say âlifeâs turning point?â How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.âHow much oxygen do you need for the summit?â sounds more like âHow much do you need to hold on to life?â How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, âIs this journey worth this much?âI had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my fatherâs memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered natureâs masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like âHow will I endure?â and âHow will I finish?â started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of âGodsâ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just thereâbefore and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colomboâs Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resortâs expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the islandâs famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lionâs Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. âThatâs a better figure now as we are recovering.âThe travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the UkraineâRussia war, and Chinaâs zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the countryâs GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the worldâs best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.âTourism is gaining momentum,â says Somasiri. âThe British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.âJanuary-August is the peak season for foreigners. âFrom December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,â says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, âDon't take selfies with your back to Buddha.â Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.âThese infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the countryâs dry zone,â says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrewâs, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lankaâs hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as âLittle Englandâ. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sitaâs whereabouts.In Ella, Ravanaâs waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasnât crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galleâs 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.âThe main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,â says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.âWe have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,â added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. âWe have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,â says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.âThe other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,â says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki MandirâJanaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earthâthe Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10Â°c to 20Â°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the worldâs third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the schoolâto quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. Itâs the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leaderâs birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidimâs lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldnât help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughterâsymbols of my childhood.

Itâs a tough one to take.Watkins was denied by Leicester keeper Mads Hermansen in the first period but was involved in Villaâs opener.The closest Leicester came to an equaliser in the first half was a bundled effort by Caleb Okoli that almost surprised Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez.Leicester were better after the break and had the ball in the net when Oliver Skipp crossed for Jamie Vardy to steer in a shot but the referee David Coote had already blown the whistle after he played an inadvertent part in the build-up.Duranâs beautifully guided header from Lucas Digneâs cross doubled Villaâs lead but when substitute Buonanotte struck for the hosts it set some nerves jangling in the visitorsâ ranks.Vardy twice went down looking for penalties but was rightly not rewarded despite the howls of protest around the ground.Cooper was critical of the standard of refereeing, not just with the turned down penalties but also with the award of the free kick that led to Villaâs opening goal.âWe know where the level of refereeing is now. Weâve known for a number of years. We just need to take a step back and say âthis is how it isâ,â Cooper said.Brighton end 10-man Arsenalâs winning start with 1-1 draw Brighton and Hove Albion ended Arsenalâs winning start to the new Premier League season with a 1-1 draw at The Emirates on Saturday, with the home side holding on with 10 men after Declan Riceâs second-half sending-off.Arsenal dominated the first half and deservedly led at halftime after Kai Havertz finished brilliantly in the 38th minute, having been played in expertly by Bukayo Saka.Four minutes into the second half, however, Arsenalâs task was made all the harder when Rice was sent off after picking up a second yellow card. Brazilian striker Joao Pedro fired Brighton level 12 minutes later.Both sides missed golden chances to win the contest late on, but they each had to settle for a point that keeps Arsenal and Brighton unbeaten in their three games so far.Saka could have snatched the win late on, while Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya had to be at his best on several occasions to keep Brighton from earning all three points, but both seemed content with a draw after an exhilarating tussle.âWe didnât create enough chances when they went down to 10 men, but we will go away and look at it,â Brighton captain Lewis Dunk said.Bellegarde stunner earns Wolves first point at Forest Jean-Ricner Bellegardeâs stunning strike earned Wolverhampton Wanderers their first point of the Premier League season with a 1-1 draw at Nottingham Forest on Saturday.In a frantic start to the game, New Zealand striker Chris Wood headed the hosts into a 10th-minute lead from a corner, having been left completely unmarked in the penalty area.Bellegarde issued an immediate response, however, lashing home a sensational hit two minutes later.Both sides failed to create clearcut chances to snatch all three points as Forest remained unbeaten this season.Each of the last four league games between Forest and Wolves have now ended in draws, the most in succession during this fixtureâs history. It is also the same number of stalemates as across their 20 league meetings combined.âIt was a poor goal from us to concede but we were able to bounce back,â Wolves boss Gary OâNeil told the BBC.Ipswich secured first point of season in draw with Fulham A first-half goal from Liam Delap earned Ipswich their first Premier League point of the season, but they had to share the spoils in a 1-1 home draw with Fulham on Saturday after winger Adama Traore grabbed an equaliser.Following successive losses to Manchester City and Liverpool, the home side got off the mark as Marco Silvaâs Fulham followed up their win over Leicester City with another strong performance.Roared on by an enthusiastic home crowd, Delap put Ipswich ahead in the 15th minute, drifting across the box before lashing in a powerful shot that Fulham keeper Bernd Leno got his gloves to but could not keep out.The visitors levelled 17 minutes later after Antonee Robinson whipped the ball across the box and Traore stabbed it home with a superb first-time finish to crown Fulhamâs best attack of the game.Fulhamâs Robinson went in the book just before the hour mark for dragging down Chiedozie Ogbene and both sides showed plenty of aggression, especially at set pieces.Delap almost teed Ogbene up for a second goal for Ipswich in the 68th minute but his pass that sliced through the middle of the Fulham defence was slightly too hard, and Leno beat the winger to the ball.Fulhamâs best chances came on the counter and Raul Jimenez forced a fine save from Arijanet Muric as the clock ticked up towards 90 minutes.Winger Omari Hutchinson almost capped a man-of-the-match display for Ipswich with a stoppage-time goal, but again Leno was equal to the task.Mbeumo doubles as Brentford eases past Southampton Bryan Mbeumoâs double and a goal by Yoane Wissa earned Brentford a comfortable 3-1 home win over promoted Southampton in the Premier League on Saturday.Brentford, who beat Crystal Palace 2-1 in their season opener but lost to Liverpool 2-0 last weekend, moved up to fifth on six points while Southampton are 19th and still without a point.âThey made errors because we pressed them unbelievably well,â Brentford coach Thomas Frank told the BBC.Mbeumo put the hosts in front just before halftime with a simple low finish, following up on Kevin Schadeâs strike which bounced off the post.He doubled the advantage in the 65th minute with a first-time shot into the bottom corner of the net.Brentford profited from another defensive error by Southampton, who lost the ball just outside the box and Mathias Jensen played in Mbeumo with a precise pass for his third goal in three Premier League games.âIt was a great team performance today,â said Mbeumo. âWe stuck to the plan the gaffer gave us and it worked perfectly.âWissa bundled the ball in past Southampton keeper Aaron Ramsdale in the 69th, making it 3-0 after Nathan Collins headed the ball on from near the back line following a throw-in.Ramsdale started for Southampton one day after finalising a four-year deal from Arsenal.Southampton made two attacking substitutions at halftime, introducing striker Cameron Archer and midfielder Mateus Fernandes but they managed only two shots on target after the break.Defender Yukinari Sugawara scored a consolation goal in stoppage time for the visitors, who lost their first three games of a league season for the first time since 2012-13.Bournemouth stun Everton with last-gasp three-goal salvo Bournemouth scored three late goals to stun Everton 3-2 in the Premier League at Goodison Park on Saturday and leave the hosts without a point from three matches.Everton, under pressure after two league losses, opened up a 2-0 lead in a seven-minute spell after the breakthrough goals from Michael Keane and Dominic Calvert-Lewin.Bournemouth spent most of the game on the back foot, barely threatening the Everton goal, but with three minutes left they pulled a goal back when Antoine Semenyo poked home from close range.In added time, Lewis Cookâs powerful header found the back of the net and Luis Sinisterra broke Everton hearts with the winner to leave Everton rooted to the bottom of the table.âYou have to kill teams off at every level, but particularly at this level,â Everton manager Sean Dyche said.The sun shone on Goodison, with the fans in fine voice despite their sideâs dismal start to the season but the opening half brought little in the way of chances.That all changed five minutes after the interval when Calvert-Lewin chested the ball down to Keane who drilled a low shot past keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, and seven minutes later it looked all over for Bournemouth.Dwight McNeil slid the perfect ball into the path of Calvert-Lewin who slotted his shot over the onrushing Kepa and it looked as though Bournemouth would suffer their first league defeat of the season.Instead, however, Everton managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, conceding three goals in quick succession to undo all of their good work.Dango Ouattaraâs cross across the goal found Semenyo at the back post to pull one back and Bournemouth looked set for a third successive Premier League draw when an unmarked Cook met Sinisterraâs cross and powered his header beyond Jordan Pickford.The game was deep into added time when Justin Kluivert sent a cross into the area and Sinisterra lost his markers to head home the winner and move Bournemouth up to seventh in the standings on five points.âIt was the worst game we played this season. We had been playing very well before but Everton deserved to win today,â Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola said.

The dream that I saw when I was 10 years old finally came true,â she said after the historic victory.âThis medal is not just for me but for the entire country. âIt was a really tough matchâ¦ and I was very nervous. When the bout against Micev was going even at 7-7, 8-8, I thought about the Tokyo Paralympics. I did not want to repeat the last Olympicsâ miss so I gathered myself together and started scoring kick-after-kick in the final 10 seconds. Finally I did itâ¦. I won the historic medal for Nepal.âGoverdhan also became the first Nepali athlete to win a medal at an Olympic level.Nepal has never won an official medal at the Summer Games in its 60-year long Olympic historyânot considering Bidhan Lamaâs bronze in the exhibition taekwondo event at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and the gold presented to Tejbir Bura at the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix, France for his alpinism effort as part of the 1922 British Mount Everest expedition. Neither medal was officially recognised by the International Olympic Committee.Nepal made its Paralympics Games debut at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, sending Nirmala Gyawali in the womenâs shot-put event. Jit Bahadur Khadka was the second athlete to participate at the Paralympic Games. He competed in the men's 100m at 2008 Summer Paralympics.âIt feels surreal because back home no one imagines Nepal winning a medal on the world stage. But I have done itâ¦ my team has done it. Hopefully, this historic moment will help change the situation for all the para-athletes in Nepal,â added Goverdhan.âThere are many talented para-athletes in Nepal. If they get more resources and exposure, many medals will come in the future,â she said. The 21-year-old para taekwondo athlete Goverdhan, who appeared in her second successive Paralympics, finally got the reward after coming ever so close to a historic bronze at the Tokyo Paralympics three years ago.Goverdhan, who entered Tokyo Paralympic Games on a wildcard, won two repechage events to enter the bronze medal final but lost to Chinaâs Li Yujie in the womenâs 58kg K44 in the bronze medal final in Tokyo, finishing fifth.\"It was my first Paralympics,â recalled Goverdhan. âI was just 18 at that time. I was still a novice. I felt really bad when I missed out on bronze. When you lose, you just donât want to see yourself crying. But I knew. It happened once, and it will never happen again.âGoverdhan has only gotten better over time.Two years later, at the Asian Para Games 2022 in Hangzhou, China, Goverdhan etched her name in history books by becoming the first Nepali athlete to win a medal at the Asian Para Games. Goverdhan defeated Chinaâs Yang Li Ting 14-1 to enter the semi-finals that assured her at least a bronze medal.Following Nepalâs another poor showing at the Paris Summer Games which took place from July 26 to August 11, hopes of an Olympic medal for the country solely rested on Goverdhan. She became the first Nepali paralympian to qualify for the Paralympic Games following her victory over Iranâs Leila Mirzae in the final of the Asian Qualification Tournament in Taiyang, China.Goverdhan did not disappoint. In Paris, she defeated Valeria Morales of Venezuela 31-0 in the round of 16 to progress to the quarter-finals. She lost to Tokyo Paralympics bronze medallist Silvana Fernandes of Brazil 8-10 in the last eight but clawed her way back to defeat Sophie Caverzan of France 2-1 in the repechage contest to set up the bronze medal final against Micev.âEveryone believed in my capacity and expected a medal from me. I am really grateful for all those who had faith in me. I am happy that I am finally able to give this Paralympic medal as a gift in return,â said Goverdhan.âI want to thank my parents, my coach, Nepal Taekwondo Association, Paralympic Committee, National Sports Council and all my supporters.âFollowing the victory, her coaches raced onto the mat and draped a Nepal flag around Goverdhan in celebration of the historic moment.Goverdhan and Nepalâs taekwondo team had trained in Manchester, England for a month before heading to Paris.âThis is a victory for all Nepali people and the country. We have finally won a medal in the Paralympic Games after getting so close in Tokyo. I am really proud of Paleshaâ¦ and thanks to her parents and associations who supported her struggle,â said her coach Kabi Raj Negi Lama who has now won his 11th international medal as coach.âThis success was possible because of the effort of Palesha and the entire team. Palesha has given a message that Nepal is also capable of winning medals at the Olympics,â added Lama. Goverdhanâs bronze medal final victory over the Serbian was her fifth overall match victory in the Paralympic Gamesâa feat no Nepali athlete has achieved either at the Summer Games or the Summer Paralympics.The bronze, you could say, was inevitable given her steady progress in international competitions.Born without a left palm, the 21-year-old Goverdhan started practising taekwondo at the age of 10. She became part of the national para taekwondo team in 2016 and made her international debut during the Asian Open Para Taekwondo Championship in Chuncheon, South Korea, where she finished fifth.Goverdhan also won gold in the Second Kathmandu Gyarogi and Poomsae International Taekwondo Competition 2018, and Asian Youth Para Games 2021 in Bahrain. She is also a bronze medallist of the Fourth Asian Para Taekwondo held in 2018 Vietnam.Goverdhan will get Rs6.5 million cash prize for his historic bronze, as provisioned in the National Sports Development Regulation 2022.She was rewarded with Rs 1.3 million for winning bronze at the Asian Para Games in Hangzhou.Her coach will receive Rs 5,085,000, manager will bag Rs 2,092,000 and the concerned sports association will get Rs 1.17 million.National Sports Council Member Secretary Tanka Lal Ghising congratulated Goverdhan âfor giving Nepali sports and the nation a valuable giftâ.Meanwhile, Nepalâs Bharat Singh Mahata crashed out of the Paris Paralympics on Thursday after he lost his menâs K44 under 58 kg round of 16 match of the taekwondo competition against Mitsuya Tanaka of Japan 3-19.Para swimmer Bhim Bahadur Kumal will compete in the menâs 50m freestyle Heat on Monday.

The 21-year-old para taekwondo athlete Goverdhan, who appeared in her second successive Paralympics, finally got the reward after coming ever so close to a historic bronze at the Tokyo Paralympics three years ago.Goverdhan, who entered Tokyo Paralympic Games on a wildcard, won two repechage events to enter the bronze medal final but lost to Chinaâs Li Yujie in the womenâs 58kg K44 in the bronze medal final in Tokyo, finishing fifth.\"It was my first Paralympics,â recalled Goverdhan. âI was just 18 at that time. I was still a novice. I felt really bad when I missed out on bronze. When you lose, you just donât want to see yourself crying. But I knew. It happened once, and it will never happen again.âGoverdhan has only gotten better over time.Two years later, at the Asian Para Games 2022 in Hangzhou, China, Goverdhan etched her name in history books by becoming the first Nepali athlete to win a medal at the Asian Para Games. Goverdhan defeated Chinaâs Yang Li Ting 14-1 to enter the semi-finals that assured her at least a bronze medal.Following Nepalâs another poor showing at the Paris Summer Games which took place from July 26 to August 11, hopes of an Olympic medal for the country solely rested on Goverdhan. She became the first Nepali paralympian to qualify for the Paralympic Games following her victory over Iranâs Leila Mirzae in the final of the Asian Qualification Tournament in Taiyang, China.Goverdhan did not disappoint. In Paris, she defeated Valeria Morales of Venezuela 31-0 in the round of 16 to progress to the quarter-finals. She lost to Tokyo Paralympics bronze medallist Silvana Fernandes of Brazil 8-10 in the last eight but clawed her way back to defeat Sophie Caverzan of France 2-1 in the repechage contest to set up the bronze medal final against Micev.âEveryone believed in my capacity and expected a medal from me. I am really grateful for all those who had faith in me. I am happy that I am finally able to give this Paralympic medal as a gift in return,â said Goverdhan.âI want to thank my parents, my coach, Nepal Taekwondo Association, Paralympic Committee, National Sports Council and all my supporters.âFollowing the victory, her coaches raced onto the mat and draped a Nepal flag around Goverdhan in celebration of the historic moment.Goverdhan and Nepalâs taekwondo team had trained in Manchester, England for a month before heading to Paris.âThis is a victory for all Nepali people and the country. We have finally won a medal in the Paralympic Games after getting so close in Tokyo. I am really proud of Paleshaâ¦ and thanks to her parents and associations who supported her struggle,â said her coach Kabi Raj Negi Lama who has now won his 11th international medal as coach.âThis success was possible because of the effort of Palesha and the entire team. Palesha has given a message that Nepal is also capable of winning medals at the Olympics,â added Lama. Goverdhanâs bronze medal final victory over the Serbian was her fifth overall match victory in the Paralympic Gamesâa feat no Nepali athlete has achieved either at the Summer Games or the Summer Paralympics.The bronze, you could say, was inevitable given her steady progress in international competitions.Born without a left palm, the 21-year-old Goverdhan started practising taekwondo at the age of 10. She became part of the national para taekwondo team in 2016 and made her international debut during the Asian Open Para Taekwondo Championship in Chuncheon, South Korea, where she finished fifth.Goverdhan also won gold in the Second Kathmandu Gyarogi and Poomsae International Taekwondo Competition 2018, and Asian Youth Para Games 2021 in Bahrain. She is also a bronze medallist of the Fourth Asian Para Taekwondo held in 2018 Vietnam.Goverdhan will get Rs6.5 million cash prize for his historic bronze, as provisioned in the National Sports Development Regulation 2022.She was rewarded with Rs 1.3 million for winning bronze at the Asian Para Games in Hangzhou.Her coach will receive Rs 5,085,000, manager will bag Rs 2,092,000 and the concerned sports association will get Rs 1.17 million.National Sports Council Member Secretary Tanka Lal Ghising congratulated Goverdhan âfor giving Nepali sports and the nation a valuable giftâ.Meanwhile, Nepalâs Bharat Singh Mahata crashed out of the Paris Paralympics on Thursday after he lost his menâs K44 under 58 kg round of 16 match of the taekwondo competition against Mitsuya Tanaka of Japan 3-19.Para swimmer Bhim Bahadur Kumal will compete in the menâs 50m freestyle Heat on Monday.

It said troops killed militants and dismantled military infrastructure in Gaza City, while they located weapons and killed gunmen in Tel Al-Sultan in western Rafah.In Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, families returned to their areas after the army ended a 22-day offensive it said was aimed at preventing Hamas from regrouping. Footage showed large areas were flattened, and buildings and infrastructure were destroyed.Medics said they recovered at least nine bodies from the area where the army operated.The latest episode in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when Hamas fighters attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Israelâs subsequent assault on the Hamas-governed enclave has since killed more than 40,600 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry. Nearly the entire Gaza population of 2.3 million has been displaced and the enclave has a hunger crisis. Israel faces genocide allegations at the World Court that it denies.In the occupied West Bank, Israel forces pushed on with a military operation in the city of Jenin. Drones and helicopters circled overhead while the sound of sporadic firing could be heard in the city. ","summary":"Israeli strikes on Saturday killed at least 48 people in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian health authorities said, as clashes took place in central and southern areas of the enclave ahead of the planned start of a polio vaccination campaign.The United Nations is due to start vaccinating some 640,000 children in the territory against polio, relying on daily eight-hour pauses in fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas militants in specific areas of the besieged enclave.On Saturday, medics administered vaccines on some of the children at Nasser Hospital wards in a symbolic move before the official campaign begins.The campaign follows confirmation last week that a baby was partially paralysed by the type 2 polio virus, the first such case in the territory in 25 years.WHO officials say at least 90% of the children need to be vaccinated twice with four weeks between doses for the campaign to succeed, but it faces huge challenges in Gaza, which has been largely destroyed by nearly 11 months of war.On Saturday, as more than 2,000 medical and community workers prepared for the start of the campaign, medics in Nuseirat, one of the Gaza Stripâs eight historic refugee camps, medics said separate Israeli strikes killed at least 19 people, including nine members of the same family.More than 30 other people were killed in a series of strikes in other areas of Gaza, medics said.Residents and militant sources said fighters from Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, and other groups fought against Israeli forces in the northern Gaza Zeitoun neighborhood, where tanks have been operating for days, and in Rafah, near the border with Egypt.The Israeli military said in a statement it continued to operate in the central and southern Gaza Strip. It said troops killed militants and dismantled military infrastructure in Gaza City, while they located weapons and killed gunmen in Tel Al-Sultan in western Rafah.In Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, families returned to their areas after the army ended a 22-day offensive it said was aimed at preventing Hamas from regrouping. Footage showed large areas were flattened, and buildings and infrastructure were destroyed.Medics said they recovered at least nine bodies from the area where the army operated.The latest episode in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when Hamas fighters attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Israelâs subsequent assault on the Hamas-governed enclave has since killed more than 40,600 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry. Nearly the entire Gaza population of 2.3 million has been displaced and the enclave has a hunger crisis. Israel faces genocide allegations at the World Court that it denies.In the occupied West Bank, Israel forces pushed on with a military operation in the city of Jenin. Drones and helicopters circled overhead while the sound of sporadic firing could be heard in the city.

She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nationâs divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelorâs degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, âNot having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.âOn March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. âThere are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,â he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the âKumari Gharâ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. âMatina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,â said Shakya. âThe kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,â he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. âThe traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,â he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or âgoddessesâ, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjanâs complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, âIf Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.âThe case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the countryâs President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjanâs petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.âPeople who donât understand the culture shouldnât comment on it,â she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. âPeople who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,â she said.âAfter the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,â she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.âThe only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,â said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. âKumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumariâs tuition time,â he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.âThe Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,â said Shakya, former Kumari Matinaâs father.âSome people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I donât believe it violates any of my childâs rights.âWhile the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. âShe enjoys this normal life and it didnât take her long to adjust as well,â says Matinaâs father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932â1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interestsâas a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimesâgambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?âI remember once seeing a small board that read âJawalakhel Zoological Gardenâ,â Koirala says. âI donât know whether it was from Juddhaâs time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.âKoirala adds, âThere is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddhaâs time.âBirds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepalâs rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepalâs royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book âSocial History of Nepalâ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapurâs King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipurâs King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained âtiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deerâ¦ heron, peacockâ¦ pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.âJung Bahadur Ranaâs zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to âsupervise and inspect itâ. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddhaâs biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in âThe Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Ranaâ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmanduâs Rana community including Juddhaâs descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, SchÃ¶nbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the worldâs first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddhaâs inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled âCentral zoo in state of neglectâ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day âreceived a pair of leopards as a giftâ, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report âCentral Zoo Master Planâ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals âincluding deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmanduâ could be put into one compound in the âlonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhariâ.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patanâs King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zooâs layoutâexcept for the small plots of lands acquired laterâthat was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddhaâs zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosuresâthe southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddhaâs zoo house?âWe cannot tell for sure,â Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.âIn those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,â Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monalâfrom the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddhaâs zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shresthaâs account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungleâs kingâcreatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as giftsâappearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsherâs âShree Teen Juddha Mahimaâ published during Juddhaâs reign in 1943.âOne need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,â he writes. âIt will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.âAmong these incredible creatures, one reigned supremeâlion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungleâs king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddhaâs zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.âWhere bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,â Koirala says. âThese were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.âNear these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddhaâs place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zooâs entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddhaâs elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumariâs enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumariâs statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumariâs statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhelâs most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.âOn June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbarâ¦ the pond nearby looked very scenic,â says a Gorkhapatra news report titled âStatue installationâ dated July 5, 1935. âBecause it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranathâ¦ and moreover since an ideal womanâs statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.âLess than fifty metres from Karma Kumariâs statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zooâs meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zooâs lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?âI think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,â Subodh Rana said. âIt is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.âFor one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one âneed not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countriesâ suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatarsâa neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lionâs roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world cameâcreatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each otherâs joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddhaâs Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddhaâs Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. ","summary":"What animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?âWe only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,â says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. âThat too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.âToday, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the worldâfrom tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932â1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interestsâas a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimesâgambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?âI remember once seeing a small board that read âJawalakhel Zoological Gardenâ,â Koirala says. âI donât know whether it was from Juddhaâs time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.âKoirala adds, âThere is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddhaâs time.âBirds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepalâs rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepalâs royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book âSocial History of Nepalâ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapurâs King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipurâs King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained âtiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deerâ¦ heron, peacockâ¦ pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.âJung Bahadur Ranaâs zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to âsupervise and inspect itâ. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddhaâs biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in âThe Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Ranaâ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmanduâs Rana community including Juddhaâs descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, SchÃ¶nbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the worldâs first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddhaâs inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled âCentral zoo in state of neglectâ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day âreceived a pair of leopards as a giftâ, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report âCentral Zoo Master Planâ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals âincluding deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmanduâ could be put into one compound in the âlonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhariâ.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patanâs King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zooâs layoutâexcept for the small plots of lands acquired laterâthat was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddhaâs zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosuresâthe southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddhaâs zoo house?âWe cannot tell for sure,â Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.âIn those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,â Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monalâfrom the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddhaâs zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shresthaâs account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungleâs kingâcreatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as giftsâappearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsherâs âShree Teen Juddha Mahimaâ published during Juddhaâs reign in 1943.âOne need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,â he writes. âIt will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.âAmong these incredible creatures, one reigned supremeâlion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungleâs king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddhaâs zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.âWhere bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,â Koirala says. âThese were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.âNear these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddhaâs place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zooâs entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddhaâs elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumariâs enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumariâs statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumariâs statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhelâs most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.âOn June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbarâ¦ the pond nearby looked very scenic,â says a Gorkhapatra news report titled âStatue installationâ dated July 5, 1935. âBecause it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranathâ¦ and moreover since an ideal womanâs statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.âLess than fifty metres from Karma Kumariâs statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zooâs meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zooâs lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?âI think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,â Subodh Rana said. âIt is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.âFor one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one âneed not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countriesâ suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. âAll books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,â Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. âI donât know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.âTranslating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepalâs book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the whoâs who of the world literature. Such endeavours havenât just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. âThese translations are poor,â Baral says. âTomes with 1200â1300 pages have been trimmed to 200â300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.âAnother popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.âWe have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,â Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The bookâs Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: âAchyut Koirala, who has a masterâs in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.âKoirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasnât just translated the book but has also done âcreative writingâ with it.âRich Dad Poor Dadâ, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books thatâs perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the bookâall unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, âAt this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.âBasanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. âBut how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!â Thapa wonders. âReaders who havenât read the original wouldnât know the faults in the translated versions.â Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ârecreateâ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslimaâs books are the major victimsTaslimaâs memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as âSangharshaâ, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the bookâs sequel as âPrem ra Jeevanâ. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslimaâs permission. âAbout a decade back, we didnât know how to ask for permission,â he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody elseâs work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslimaâs anthology of essays No Country for Women as âAaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhainaâ. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. âI have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,â Pradhan, who is also a childrenâs book writer, says. âI just copy-edited it upon request.âBishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. âWe translated the book long ago,â he says. âWe are still trying to get translation rights.âIndigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrarâs Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. âAfter I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,â Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Kheraâs You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the bookâs unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they donât even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that itâd be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the authorâs permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldnât demand much for translation rights given Nepalâs small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. âPublishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,â he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harariâs bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the bookâs translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguruâs Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. âThis phenomenon not just hampers Nepalâs fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the countryâs reputation in the global market,â Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. âWe donât have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,â he says. âNobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.â Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.Oneâs pain, anotherâs pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, âThis is a pirated copy and Iâm the author of this book.â The youth wasnât bothered and replied, âOkay, you can buy it at a discount.âThis anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehtaâs friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. âWe sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,â says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepalâs image internationally. âThere was a time when Bangladesh would be known as âpiracy kingâ,â he said. âNow there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.âAs tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.âAfter the governmentâs decision, we stopped importing books for a while,â says Shrestha of Education Books. âThe import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.âPirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesnât levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. âThe government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the countryâs economy as well,â he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House Indiaâs sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. âTo confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,â Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, âKeeping ISBN number at oneâs will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.âBy the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrarâs office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Actâs clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Actâs subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Actâs clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. âAll books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,â Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. âI donât know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.âTranslating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepalâs book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the whoâs who of the world literature. Such endeavours havenât just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. âThese translations are poor,â Baral says. âTomes with 1200â1300 pages have been trimmed to 200â300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.âAnother popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.âWe have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,â Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The bookâs Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: âAchyut Koirala, who has a masterâs in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.âKoirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasnât just translated the book but has also done âcreative writingâ with it.âRich Dad Poor Dadâ, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books thatâs perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the bookâall unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, âAt this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.âBasanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. âBut how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!â Thapa wonders. âReaders who havenât read the original wouldnât know the faults in the translated versions.â Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ârecreateâ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslimaâs books are the major victimsTaslimaâs memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as âSangharshaâ, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the bookâs sequel as âPrem ra Jeevanâ. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslimaâs permission. âAbout a decade back, we didnât know how to ask for permission,â he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody elseâs work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslimaâs anthology of essays No Country for Women as âAaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhainaâ. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. âI have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,â Pradhan, who is also a childrenâs book writer, says. âI just copy-edited it upon request.âBishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. âWe translated the book long ago,â he says. âWe are still trying to get translation rights.âIndigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrarâs Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. âAfter I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,â Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Kheraâs You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the bookâs unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they donât even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that itâd be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the authorâs permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldnât demand much for translation rights given Nepalâs small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. âPublishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,â he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harariâs bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the bookâs translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguruâs Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. âThis phenomenon not just hampers Nepalâs fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the countryâs reputation in the global market,â Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. âWe donât have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,â he says. âNobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.â Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.Oneâs pain, anotherâs pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, âThis is a pirated copy and Iâm the author of this book.â The youth wasnât bothered and replied, âOkay, you can buy it at a discount.âThis anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehtaâs friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. âWe sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,â says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepalâs image internationally. âThere was a time when Bangladesh would be known as âpiracy kingâ,â he said. âNow there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.âAs tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.âAfter the governmentâs decision, we stopped importing books for a while,â says Shrestha of Education Books. âThe import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.âPirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesnât levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. âThe government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the countryâs economy as well,â he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House Indiaâs sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. âTo confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,â Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, âKeeping ISBN number at oneâs will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.âBy the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrarâs office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Actâs clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Actâs subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Actâs clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the âimportation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.âIf anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provisionâs implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. âCreation is a crucial part of humanityâs benefit,â he says. âIf intellectual property is not protected effectively, then thereâd be no inspiration to create something.âBal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.âIn the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,â Mukhiya says. âBut in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.â(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

The staged phase-out of the quota under the Multifibre Arrangement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)âa short-term international trade agreement relating to textiles and garmentsâwhich came to full circle at the end of 2005, opened the market for competition. Consequently, there was a free fall in the exports of those countries that could not compete.Nepal was the single loser among the least-developed countries in Asia. Conversely, two other countries, Bangladesh and Cambodia, made good progress in maintaining and upscaling their exports in the international markets. With the steady growth of garment and apparel exports, Bangladesh is now the second-largest exporter after China.Trade partnerThe United States and the European Union (EU) are the major export destinations for Nepali garments. The phase-out of the quota and the gradual reduction in import duties in the EU countries have had a double-whammy effect on Nepali products. This causes the loss of a secured market on one side and unfastens open competition with other players on the other. Traditionally, the US has been a big market for textiles and apparel, but the market was protected for domestic producers. The protective rate of customs duties ranges from 5 to 32 percent, depending upon the type of fabric and the specific product category. For a landlocked country like Nepal, where the cost of transit transportation is an extra burden, it is almost impossible to offset the production and shipment costs to penetrate the US market. Hence, Nepal sought some reprieve to check the spiralling exports and looked for preferences that aligned with the African Growth Opportunity Act (AGOA), which assists the economies of sub-Saharan Africa and improves economic relations between the US and the region. During the first decade of the century, several Nepali delegations visited the US to discuss the issues in the Trade and Investment Council formed under the Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFA) agreement. Initiatives taken from both sides to provide relief to the ailing garment industries of Nepal also resulted in the introduction of the Nepal Trade Preferences Bill in the US Congress. However, the initiatives didnât see the light of day until the bill was re-introduced at the end of 2015. Section 915 of the bill passed by the US Congress under the title âTrade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Actâ has made provisions for providing tariff concessions to 77 products produced in Nepal.This concession was offered as a good gesture to support Nepal in recovering from the adverse effects of the 2015 earthquake. Textile items, leather and footwear, clothing and others were among the listed products. Although the Act was enacted on December 30, 2016, its benefits remain largely unutilised. Nepali industries complain that actively traded products stay out of this list.Despite the provisions on zero tariff preferences extended to the said Nepali products, the preference utilisation rate is at the lower end. A study done by a think tank based in Kathmandu shows that the utilisation rate in the export of these products was 26.5 percent between 2017 and 2021. The scheme includes major export items from Nepal, including carpets, shawls, handbags, gloves and clothing accessories. However, the total volume is insignificant compared to the total import of these products in the US.The US is Nepalâs important trade partner. Over the last decade or so, it has become the second export destination after India and is one of the countryâs eight top import sources. Unlike other major trade partners, there is no wider gap between Nepali exports and imports from the US.The weaker supply-side capacity is the major constraint to the poor performance of Nepali exports under the trade preferences programme. The production cost is higher in Nepal due to extra costs involved in transit transportation, low labour productivity and poor transportation and logistics services. Inadequate human resources in the factories and manufacturing units also add to this problem. Another crucial factor is the inability of the Nepali producers to switch over to the products covered under the scheme. There were continued efforts to increase the preferencesâ coverage of traditionally traded items rather than exploring and utilising the new products.However, certain conditions are laid for eligibility of the preferences under the scheme. First, the rules of origin criteria are more stringent than other trade agreements, such as bilateral agreements with India and South Asian Free Trade Area provisions. Second, the eligibility criteria for the African Growth Opportunities Act also apply to this scheme. Nepal qualifies under those stated parameters but is still not making substantial progress in utilising the preferences. This requires reorientation of the domestic policies and measures to encourage the producers and manufacturers to introduce changes to their production and processes to fit into the framework of the programmes.Way forward Minimising production costs and delivering goods are the primary requirements for industries. We could leverage the special economic zones established near the border posts to incentivise the manufacturing units with rebates in leasehold fees and attenuated regulatory arrangements. Programmes for improving the efficiency of transportation and logistics services should be implemented. Skill development of the workers through training and retraining, increasing access to finance, and awareness building of the exporters on issues like dealing with intellectual property rights should also be executed. Proper documentation of preferences is equally vital in export development. Backward linkages should be encouraged by focusing on the use of domestic textiles and fibres so that the benefit of export trickles down to the rural household.Another caveat is that the preferences available to Nepal under the US Trade Preferences Scheme will be over by the end of 2025, around 16 months from now. Nepal is on the path to graduating from LDC in 2026, so the government must develop a strategy and plan to continue with the preferences even after graduation. The US and Nepal may carry on negotiations for this arrangement, and the Trade and Investment Council can serve as the best platform for such consultations.

A study done by a think tank based in Kathmandu shows that the utilisation rate in the export of these products was 26.5 percent between 2017 and 2021. The scheme includes major export items from Nepal, including carpets, shawls, handbags, gloves and clothing accessories. However, the total volume is insignificant compared to the total import of these products in the US.The US is Nepalâs important trade partner. Over the last decade or so, it has become the second export destination after India and is one of the countryâs eight top import sources. Unlike other major trade partners, there is no wider gap between Nepali exports and imports from the US.The weaker supply-side capacity is the major constraint to the poor performance of Nepali exports under the trade preferences programme. The production cost is higher in Nepal due to extra costs involved in transit transportation, low labour productivity and poor transportation and logistics services. Inadequate human resources in the factories and manufacturing units also add to this problem. Another crucial factor is the inability of the Nepali producers to switch over to the products covered under the scheme. There were continued efforts to increase the preferencesâ coverage of traditionally traded items rather than exploring and utilising the new products.However, certain conditions are laid for eligibility of the preferences under the scheme. First, the rules of origin criteria are more stringent than other trade agreements, such as bilateral agreements with India and South Asian Free Trade Area provisions. Second, the eligibility criteria for the African Growth Opportunities Act also apply to this scheme. Nepal qualifies under those stated parameters but is still not making substantial progress in utilising the preferences. This requires reorientation of the domestic policies and measures to encourage the producers and manufacturers to introduce changes to their production and processes to fit into the framework of the programmes.Way forward Minimising production costs and delivering goods are the primary requirements for industries. We could leverage the special economic zones established near the border posts to incentivise the manufacturing units with rebates in leasehold fees and attenuated regulatory arrangements. Programmes for improving the efficiency of transportation and logistics services should be implemented. Skill development of the workers through training and retraining, increasing access to finance, and awareness building of the exporters on issues like dealing with intellectual property rights should also be executed. Proper documentation of preferences is equally vital in export development. Backward linkages should be encouraged by focusing on the use of domestic textiles and fibres so that the benefit of export trickles down to the rural household.Another caveat is that the preferences available to Nepal under the US Trade Preferences Scheme will be over by the end of 2025, around 16 months from now. Nepal is on the path to graduating from LDC in 2026, so the government must develop a strategy and plan to continue with the preferences even after graduation. The US and Nepal may carry on negotiations for this arrangement, and the Trade and Investment Council can serve as the best platform for such consultations.

A trainee doctor was brutally raped and murdered while resting in a seminar room after completing a 36-hour shift at the hospital. Tens of thousands of people in Indiaâs major cities have taken to the streets, demanding justice and prompt investigation. The event has stirred anger in India, especially among women, highlighting the discourse on womenâs safety and the challenges faced by female medical professionals. The RG Kar Medical College incident should ring alarm bells all over South Asia as it is a reminder of how women in the region are unsafe regardless of who they are, what they do or where they go. It also reminds us of the precarious situation of womenâs safety in Nepal, where rape cases and violations of womenâs rights in general are on the up. The Informal Sector Service Centre (INSEC) published the Nepal Human Rights Year Book 2023, which documented 4,228 victims of womenâs rights violations in Nepal in 2022. The report documents 605 incidents of rape, 145 cases of attempted rape and 42 incidents of sexual abuse. In 2021, there were only 3,417 such victims, up from 2,606 in 2020.Last week, police detained six people in Arjundhara of Jhapa district for gang-raping a 16-year-old girl.

The highly publicised Nirmala Pant rape-and-murder remains unresolved, with no arrests till now. During the decade-long insurgency, many women were raped and brutally assaulted. Some were accused of being Maoists and repeatedly raped in captivity. Nearly two decades since the guns fell silent, these victims are yet to get justice. These cases reflect the extent of impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators of such crimes.The recurring rape cases point to a broader problem of patriarchal violence and social conditioning. In Nepal, this is reflected in the legal framework that is more protective of the accused than the victim. In 2022, when people protested to remove the statute of limitations on rape, which was previously only one year, the National Assembly ratified new amendments increasing the time limit by a few years. Adults could now file a lawsuit within two years of the incident, and minors could initiate legal proceedings within three years of the victims turning 18. These time limits for seeking justice do not justify crimes as horrendous as rape that are unconstitutional and against the principles of fundamental rights.

Thousands of people lose their lives in road crashes every year across the country. What are the factors causing these disasters? Why have the authorities failed to prevent them? The Post's Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former secretary Arjun Jung Thapa, who was director general at the Department of Roads for years, to discuss the pressing issue.Why are road accidents taking place so frequently in Nepal? There is no one reason for road accidents. On the infrastructure front, factors like design, condition and geometry of a road are crucial. Putting sign boards along the roads and giving vital information about the particular location is necessary. Those signs should be placed properly so all driving vehicles and passengers can see them clearly. Some technical aspects, such as whether the superelevation is properly designed, particularly at sharp bends, matter greatly. These must be regularly monitored and corrected in time. Regular vehicle fitness tests are essential. Experienced and disciplined drivers are equally important to ensure road safety. Some accidents occur when drivers are unfamiliar with the roads. For instance, the accident that took place at Anbukhaireni of Tanahun district on Friday, killing 27 Indian nationals, might have been because of the driverâs lack of familiarity with the road condition. Yet another serious concern is the lack of road discipline. Those who come to Nepal with years-long experience of driving abroad fear driving because of motorists' reckless driving and lack of lane discipline. The recent accident at Jadibuti, killing one scooter rider, could have been avoided if proper lane discipline had been followed. Reckless driving by motorcyclists has remained a big problem in our case. So, a separate lane should be designated for bikers. Similarly, lanes should be designated for vehicles based on their speed. But such rules are never followed seriously in our case. Traffic police have been entrusted with enforcing traffic rules but lack the human resources to enforce them effectively. We need an integrated and centrally controlled digital traffic light management system. We had experimented with a system as a trial for some time after 2015. We called a bid but couldnât accept anyone as the bidders proposed more than the rate we had fixed. The project collapsed, and that system could never be revived. We badly lack technology in this sector. When we try to import technology, brokers get involved and ruin the entire process. The condition of roads built haphazardly, mainly in the hills, is another major concern. What do you say about that?We have built around 80,000 kilometres of road across the country. Of that, only around 14,000 kilometres fall under the jurisdiction of the road department. The rest of the road sections fall under the jurisdiction of various authorities, such as the Department of Local Infrastructure and provincial and local governments. The busiest roads are those under the Department of Roads. They are highways and regional roads. Only 50 percent of the roads overseen by the Department of Roads are blacktopped and are not maintained properly. Of the remaining 65,000 kilometres of road, only 4,000 kilometres are blacktopped. This means that the road condition across the country is poor and must be upgraded. The government will now develop the Kakarvitta-Gorusinghe section of the East-West Highway as a safe demonstration corridor. There will be proper infrastructure for crossings, grade-separated intersections, controlled entries, fencing for the safety from wild animals and crossings for wildlife. Local vehicles will run on service lanes. If it is developed as planned, it would be on par with Asian standards. Other roads in the pipeline will follow these standards. These criteria are being implemented while upgrading the Nagdhunga-Mugling road section as well. We have miles to go to upgrade our roads to international standards. Why are we failing to make quality roads?We canât build our roads according to the original design. At times, locals obstruct road construction and force us to change the alignments. Then, we have to build them based on the availability of the land.Are our rural roads fit from the engineering perspective?Around 35,000 kilometers out of the 65,000 kilometers of roads that donât fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Roads are built randomly. Local leaders, influential individuals, and bulldozer operators fix the alignments of such roads.How can we rectify the malpractices in this sector?We need to activate the National Road Safety Council urgently. Officials from all the concerned departments and representatives from various stakeholders should sit together in this body and find solutions. Also, coordination has become more complicated in the federal system. For instance, highways are under federal jurisdiction, transport management on highways falls under provincial authority, while road management is under federal jurisdiction. Therefore, an effective coordinating body has become a must. Otherwise, we canât control the increasing trend of deaths in road accidents. At least 1,700 people lost their lives in 2013, and the then government set a target to reduce it by at least 50 percent by 2020. Instead, the yearly death toll has crossed 2,800 now.While it takes years to complete road upgrading tasks, construction materials are left unmanaged and scattered, making driving along the road very difficult and dangerous. Canât such things be improved?Contractors are powerful because of their political connection with influential leaders including prime ministers and ministers. Civil servants canât be assertive when the contractors get political protection. At times, they try to use force to coerce government officials. If the situation is not going in their favour, they provoke locals with a plan to get extension in their contract citing local unrest. Experts say that the government is also to blame as it doesnât carry out development projects properly. Do you agree?I worked for three decades in government agencies until a few months ago. What I found is that one government devises specific policies, plans and initiates certain projects but successive governments stop them. The new leadership starts its own plans and projects. Then, the contractors donât get their payment. This is the other side of the story. Another problem is that our ministers, lawmakers and leaders show interest in the projects that deserve the least priority while important projects donât get attention. For instance, around 30 kilometers of Arniko Highway, which connects Nepal with China, has been badly damaged. This is a very important road for the country. Canât the government repair and maintain a 30-kilometer section of a highway? It requires just around Rs3 billion whereas leaders have allocated over Rs11.5 billion in the projects of personal interests of leaders. Around Rs4 billion has been allocated under lawmakersâ constituency development programmes and additional Rs5 billion has been earmarked for local bridges. We have allocated around Rs60 billion for non-important projects but we have ignored a crucial road, Arniko Highway, which was built with the support of our neighbour China in the 1960s. Thus we have given unnecessary importance where it doesnât deserve while ignoring vital development projects. The road accidents are directly or indirectly linked to the governmentâs wrong policies and plans.Development projects are sometimes said to have failed due to rivalry between some leaders. Do you have any such experience?I will give you an example. In the Biratnagar-Bathnaha cross-border rail project, we had to build over 13 kilometers of the railway. It was around four to five years ago. We cleared over 11 kilometers but locals protested in the remaining section where a station was planned. The locals obstructed work there even as 85 percent of the money for land acquisition had already been distributed. Later, we found that the then minister Aman Lal Modi had provoked the locals to demand for additional money. He demanded a âspecial rate for his menâ. But the laws donât allow it.Some experts argue that to upgrade the quality of our roads, we need to make this sector competitive and, for that, we have to allow the private sector to develop projects. Is it viable?The government is hindering the private sector from entering into this business. They donât invest without assured returns. They need roads like Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway. The government called for proposals in the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model for this project. They were interested. But the government simultaneously allowed a company to build the Kathmandu-Tunnel Road in the same area. Then the investors felt a risk to invest there. But, the company couldnât continue the tunnel project. Private sector should be welcomed in this sector but we should create a conducive environment for that. Bangladesh and India have built infrastructure projects under the BOT model. We can do it as well.What do you think about the jurisdictional dispute over the New Road stretch between the Kathmandu Metropolis and the Department of Roads? Who should maintain this road?All the roads within the metropolis fall under the local governmentâs jurisdiction, as the constitution clearly states. The federal department is managing the roads with the understanding that the local governments are not efficient at maintaining them for now. If a local unit wants to maintain a certain road section on its own, the department should allow it without any dispute. Both sides showed childish behaviour while handling the New Road case. ","summary":"Lately, road accidents are taking place almost every day. Thousands of people lose their lives in road crashes every year across the country. What are the factors causing these disasters? Why have the authorities failed to prevent them? The Post's Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former secretary Arjun Jung Thapa, who was director general at the Department of Roads for years, to discuss the pressing issue.Why are road accidents taking place so frequently in Nepal? There is no one reason for road accidents. On the infrastructure front, factors like design, condition and geometry of a road are crucial. Putting sign boards along the roads and giving vital information about the particular location is necessary. Those signs should be placed properly so all driving vehicles and passengers can see them clearly. Some technical aspects, such as whether the superelevation is properly designed, particularly at sharp bends, matter greatly. These must be regularly monitored and corrected in time. Regular vehicle fitness tests are essential. Experienced and disciplined drivers are equally important to ensure road safety. Some accidents occur when drivers are unfamiliar with the roads. For instance, the accident that took place at Anbukhaireni of Tanahun district on Friday, killing 27 Indian nationals, might have been because of the driverâs lack of familiarity with the road condition. Yet another serious concern is the lack of road discipline. Those who come to Nepal with years-long experience of driving abroad fear driving because of motorists' reckless driving and lack of lane discipline. The recent accident at Jadibuti, killing one scooter rider, could have been avoided if proper lane discipline had been followed. Reckless driving by motorcyclists has remained a big problem in our case. So, a separate lane should be designated for bikers. Similarly, lanes should be designated for vehicles based on their speed. But such rules are never followed seriously in our case. Traffic police have been entrusted with enforcing traffic rules but lack the human resources to enforce them effectively. We need an integrated and centrally controlled digital traffic light management system. We had experimented with a system as a trial for some time after 2015. We called a bid but couldnât accept anyone as the bidders proposed more than the rate we had fixed. The project collapsed, and that system could never be revived. We badly lack technology in this sector. When we try to import technology, brokers get involved and ruin the entire process.

Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal sat with former minister Jhakri for more insights.You worked actively to form the CPN (Unified Socialist), but the party couldnât perform well. It couldnât even become a national party from the general elections. What went wrong?We formed the CPN (Unified Socialist) out of compulsion. When Prime Minister KP Sharma Oliâwho was prime minister at the time as wellâdissolved the House of Representatives in December 2020, we firmly stood against his move, saying that it sowed the seeds of political instability. We staged huge protests and moved the Supreme Court against the decision of Oli, our party chair at the time. I was among the petitioners. Once the top court reinstated the House, we expected the party to move smoothly. Unfortunately, that couldnât happen. The party establishment led by Oli and the rival faction took extreme actions against each other. The agitating faction announced action against the party chair, and the party establishment expelled us from the party itself. When Oli dissolved the House a second time, we protested the move as it brought instability. We were in favour of transforming the party through intra-party struggle, but the situation took some unexpected turns. We didnât quit the party with a lofty plan of making a new revolutionary organisation. We were compelled to do so.Our new party accommodated many genuine leaders who had been sidelined in the UML. But ultimately, old leaders heavily dominated the new partyâs central committee. They were active leaders of their time but were out of touch with the new, changing context. Young leaders didnât get space in party committees. I proposed recruiting at least 40 percent members under 40 years in the central committee and over 50 percent members under 30 years in the district committees. I made a 29-year-old leader the chair of the district committee in my home district. In 42 days, I attended 36 district conventions where youths in their 30s were elected district committee chairs. I tried to reach out to municipalities to promote youths in the party chapters. But at the central level, old faces dominated party committees. That didnât attract people to the party or impress the general public. Thus, it failed to gather steam right from the beginning.Many think that Madhav Kumar Nepalâs selection as party chief was a wrong move since he had led the UML for 15 years and become prime minister, and people didnât find novelty in the new party. Do you think so too?Madhav Kumar Nepal has been the most active leader in the party since its inception. Whatever the party has achieved so far is because of him. But a party leader must mobilise teams with defined roles and responsibilities and continuously motivate and engage them in result-oriented tasks. He works a lot but doesnât mobilise teams effectively. Observers say the Unified Socialist was formed due to the personality clash between top leaders and that it lacked a national agenda and a clear policy to prove the need for a new party. Do you feel so?Our immediate agenda was safeguarding the constitution and ensuring political stability in the country. We protested the House dissolution guided by the same policy. But when provincial governments were made like satellites of the federal government, we couldnât play any role in stabilising them.The UML is guided by the policy of Peopleâs Multiparty Democracy, propounded by the late Madan Bhandari. There was a debate on further enhancing the policy in the changed context. A large section of Left intellectuals were interested in contributing to that. We could have engaged them in the process. But our party stopped the debate on that topic as well. We missed the chance of engaging many critical individuals in the discourse and having a relatively different policy. When in the UML, we practised direct elections of party representatives and leaders from the conventions.

But we ran away and squandered the opportunity. If Madhav Kumar Nepal had become president on the UMLâs proposal, our party might have been reunited with the UML much earlier. I also took an initiative to that end but in vain. Later also, UML chair Oli visited our party chairâs residence to have our party on board the government.

Oli knows these leaders will support Nepal when he returns to the UML. Why would he [Oli] then merge the fringe party and create another power centre against himself? He knows Madhav Kumar Nepal will challenge him with the backing of the dissidents. It is natural for a leader to think twice before allowing another leader of your stature to create a parallel power centre within the organisation. Even I would have thought twice.

What are the challenges of forming a new political organisation in Nepal?Political parties sustain if they evolve with society. If you trace the history of the Nepalâs Congress and communist parties, you will see how they have evolved over the past seven decades. They competed against each other but joined hands to fight autocratic forces towards establishing democracy. They have done hundreds of progressive things in society. Their major fault is that they have multiple entry points but no exit policy. The only exit way is the death of the leaders. This has caused unhealthy practices and created dissident groups.The dissidents who didnât get any space within their party formed new outfits. They also amplified negative narratives against the old parties. It happened with the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre. Had there been an exit system in the party, the situation wouldnât be this bad. But new political parties canât sustain without their own political ideology and orientation. You may form an organisation, cash in on peopleâs frustration and achieve some immediate gains, but outfits canât sustain.But recent electoral trends show that Nepalis are seeking alternative forces and new faces. Can we be oblivious to that?You are right. We have seen such trends in the Panchayat system as well.

But garnering votes during elections for one term and establishing a sustainable political force are two different things.Â  "},{"hash":"43f011b147586b3e9287d46bdecbcdd5197c7d6505efd566a253cf313aa19cdb","title":"congress-uml-constitution-revision-proposal-against-election-mandate","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/08/12/congress-uml-constitution-revision-proposal-against-election-mandate","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/GirirajmanyPokharelMoistLeader021-1723424087.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1723420800000,"source":"kp","category":"interviews","content":"The CPN (Maoist Centre) has either led or been a part of the government for most of the past decade and half.

He has studied and written extensively on water resources, trans-boundary water cooperation, flood management, wash services and climate change adaptation, clean energy transition and related policy studies. In this interview with the Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal, Dixit discusses river management in Nepalâs urban areas: Where have we gone wrong in this endeavour and what can we do? You have extensively studied river systems and have been following changes seen in river basins. How do you see recent problems caused by encroachment and rampant development activities?We humans have lived and have to continue to live within water cycles: water evaporates from the ocean to the sky and then precipitates to the land and flows via rivers back to the ocean. Rivers that function as arteries of the land surface, sustaining humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems face widespread abuses: pollution, rampant extraction of their bed and banks, fragmentation and degradation. Without rivers, we would not be who we are. Unfortunately, we have forgotten this essence. We neglect and abuse rivers. In 1981, just after the monsoon ended, I, along with my students, walked from Sundarijal to Teku studying Bagmati riversâ sediment. At many places, we walked on the riverbed. The river then was clean. Gradually, the river systems began to face all-round decay. I have read painful accounts of my contemporaries who remember swimming in the clean Bagmati and its tributaries. In less than 50 years, our rivers in Kathmandu Valley and other basins no longer look like rivers. I feel helpless and ache with pain at this collective failure! What state of rivers are we passing on to our next generation?River encroachment is common across Nepal but more serious in urban areas, including in Kathmandu. How can this be stopped?Our approach to rivers is an imitation of the trend common across South Asia, or the subcontinent, which is again largely based on the knowledge system developed in the industrialised Global North without contextualising locally. The region features waterscapes of high and punctuated rainfall during the monsoon months, rivers, wetlands, ponds, and springs, all connected with groundwater aquifers in one of the most complex landscapes of the world: the Himalaya-Ganga region. Yet, current development endeavours subjugate water rather than respect and live with it. In 2022, the Indus River in Pakistan faced major floods with devastating consequences. Referring to these floods, a group of global scientists stated that âthe impacts [of the floods] were the outcome of an outdated river management system.â This approach is primarily based on building of physical structures such as buildings, bridges and roads close to rivers interfering with their natural flows. The approach that began in the early twentieth century keeps marching on even while we are facing twenty first century water challenges.There is an increasing trend of building corridor roads along the rivers in Kathmandu as well as other places. Is this a good or bad practice? In Nepal, road building in the hills has earned the sobriquet of âdozer roads,â meaning politically designed roads excavated by heavy machine operators without adhering to basic engineering, social, environmental, or hydrological safeguards. Even highways built with âengineering,â such as the Mugling-Narayanghat section, face regular accidents. The sliding of the two buses in the Trishuli is the recent example. Building roads along the banks of rivers, defined as âriver corridors,â is the preferred approach for improving connectivity. In the Kathmandu Valley, this is also associated with rivers shackled within concrete walls in the name of river beautification. In the monsoon, however, they all overflow as we have been seeing in the last few years and this year as well.What will happen to these rivers 10-15 years down the line? Is there any chance of some of our rivers dying? Or, will the measures taken in recent times protect them?All rivers must flow clean and free in selected stretches. But today, rivers are disconnected with their floodplains. Within walls and embankments, they have become conduits of filth. Many rivers are already seriously degraded. If the current trend continues, many rivers may die. I remember Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, filmmaker, and author, who wrote: âWater and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.â Our current efforts at conserving, developing and managing rivers are grossly inadequate. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw some rivers heal as human actions across the board ceased due to the lockdown. But this healing came at huge human and economic costs. The lessons, however, are clear. We must stop turning rivers into garbage cans for them to begin to heal. The onus lies on us, our activities, our governance, and the policies we make and put into practice effectively. We need new ways of imagining rivers in harmony with human needs. Otherwise, the rivers will die. If rivers die, what will become of us?What problems may city dwellers face as a result of this continued destruction of rivers?A 2020 analysis of rivers in Nepal found that the quality of rivers in the mid-hills and the Tarai are already deteriorating. Industries, cities, towns, and agriculture produce waste that, when disposed of in rivers untreated, cause pollution. Solid and liquid wastes produced by expanding cities and towns pollute nearby rivers, streams, and water bodies. Pollution kills aquatic life such as fish, which are sources of livelihood for many communities. Polluted rivers and water bodies degrade human and environmental health, leading to negative impacts on human livelihoods. The impacts of pollution on rivers are considerable during non-monsoon months when river discharge, and consequently the capacity of rivers to dilute waste, are low.What should be done to conserve the rivers, at least in the present form, and stop further damages?All rivers are a combination of water (W), energy (E), biodiversity aquatic (B), and sediment (S), represented by the acronym WEBS. In the current scheme of things, the focus is on water and energy. Aquatic ecosystems are the concern of only those working on freshwater ecosystems. They are neglected in the larger context though the state has made some provisions for conserving ecosystems. In Nepalâs Hydropower Development Policy of 2001 all hydropower plants must release 10 percent minimum flow to the downstream reaches to enable fish and other aquatic life to survive in the river. A 2021 study of 50 hydropower plants however found that none of the plants surveyed release environmental-flows. All hydropower plants, as per their power purchasing agreements, are required to produce maximum power during the dry season. We should start by accepting the fact that rivers need clean flowing water and respecting the policies we have made. Then we must systematically introduce changes and avoid the oversights embedded in the present approach. The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems. In the present approach, nobody seems to want sediment which is a natural consequence of flow within the water cycle.To meet such an objective, we need to begin with a system of integrated knowledge that synthesises natural science, social science, and indigenous practices. By incorporating fields such as hydrology, ecology, social science-supported context-specific engineering, and indigenous knowledge and practices, we can take a comprehensive approach to water management challenges and solutions. Interdisciplinary approaches can build collaboration, innovation, and systemic decision-making and promote innovative water management for the benefit of both ecosystems and human societies.Do you think initiatives such as river clean up campaigns run by various groups help protect these waterways?I see such initiatives as manifestation of dissatisfaction of concerned citizens with the degradation of rivers and to bring about changes. In 1990, I was part of the Save Bagmati Campaign, which aimed to highlight the degrading state of the river. This campaign has taken many new forms, and citizen groups have begun campaigns in other rivers of Nepal. They however remain fragmented and ad-hoc. Similar campaigns in some countries have led to granting rights to rivers. In 2017, New Zealand recognised the Whanganui River and its tributaries as legal entities, acknowledging their physical and spiritual significance as âliving and indivisibleâ and ensuring their survival, health, and integrity to balance the needs of humans and nature. Promulgations like Living Indus (Pakistan), Namami Gange river-improvement programme (India) can offer lessons for a holistic water journey. The collective voice of concerned citizens for the integrity of rivers can be a powerful medium for policy and pathway changes. Nepal must also begin country-wide river restoration initiatives. We need more dialogue and conversation around water challenges and solutions.As cities turn into concrete jungles, their water tables are said to be receding alarmingly. You often propose redesigning our settlements and development infrastructure in a way that wouldnât disturb riversâ natural courses and catchment areas. Could you elaborate?South Asia is a region of waterscapes containing streams, ponds, wetlands, open spaces, floodplains, springs, and underground aquifers. Yet, our towns, cities, and infrastructure are planned, designed, and built to disregard water rather than live with it. As land-centric urban growth dominates, waterscapes temporarily seem to vanish but later water comes back. In Nepali we have a saying âIn twelve years a stream returnsâ. The present practice of urban development is obsessed with concretisation, making these areas impermeable. Rainwater, part of which would naturally infiltrate the ground, now immediately reaches the rivers already constrained by walls. The river at a downstream section immediately peaks and when the rainfall stops the river has very low discharge. Basic parameters, like the intensity of rainfall (mm per hour), are poorly recognised and used in design guidelines. The interaction of current urbanisation practices and increasing extreme rainfall, temperature and humidity rise spawned by climate change and urban heat island effects will make our urban areas as crucible of hazards, and unhealthy. A new urban future must harmoniously integrate nature, including water bodies and wetlands, and preserve natural land cover, including traditional ponds to promote groundwater recharge. It can be further achieved by preserving green open spaces, forests, gardens, permeable âspongeâ pavements, and natural waterfronts for healthier communities in sustainable cities. The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving riversâ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey.

In the Kathmandu Valley, this is also associated with rivers shackled within concrete walls in the name of river beautification. In the monsoon, however, they all overflow as we have been seeing in the last few years and this year as well.What will happen to these rivers 10-15 years down the line? Is there any chance of some of our rivers dying? Or, will the measures taken in recent times protect them?All rivers must flow clean and free in selected stretches. But today, rivers are disconnected with their floodplains. Within walls and embankments, they have become conduits of filth. Many rivers are already seriously degraded. If the current trend continues, many rivers may die. I remember Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, filmmaker, and author, who wrote: âWater and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.â Our current efforts at conserving, developing and managing rivers are grossly inadequate. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw some rivers heal as human actions across the board ceased due to the lockdown. But this healing came at huge human and economic costs. The lessons, however, are clear. We must stop turning rivers into garbage cans for them to begin to heal. The onus lies on us, our activities, our governance, and the policies we make and put into practice effectively. We need new ways of imagining rivers in harmony with human needs. Otherwise, the rivers will die. If rivers die, what will become of us?What problems may city dwellers face as a result of this continued destruction of rivers?A 2020 analysis of rivers in Nepal found that the quality of rivers in the mid-hills and the Tarai are already deteriorating. Industries, cities, towns, and agriculture produce waste that, when disposed of in rivers untreated, cause pollution. Solid and liquid wastes produced by expanding cities and towns pollute nearby rivers, streams, and water bodies. Pollution kills aquatic life such as fish, which are sources of livelihood for many communities. Polluted rivers and water bodies degrade human and environmental health, leading to negative impacts on human livelihoods. The impacts of pollution on rivers are considerable during non-monsoon months when river discharge, and consequently the capacity of rivers to dilute waste, are low.What should be done to conserve the rivers, at least in the present form, and stop further damages?All rivers are a combination of water (W), energy (E), biodiversity aquatic (B), and sediment (S), represented by the acronym WEBS. In the current scheme of things, the focus is on water and energy. Aquatic ecosystems are the concern of only those working on freshwater ecosystems. They are neglected in the larger context though the state has made some provisions for conserving ecosystems. In Nepalâs Hydropower Development Policy of 2001 all hydropower plants must release 10 percent minimum flow to the downstream reaches to enable fish and other aquatic life to survive in the river. A 2021 study of 50 hydropower plants however found that none of the plants surveyed release environmental-flows. All hydropower plants, as per their power purchasing agreements, are required to produce maximum power during the dry season. We should start by accepting the fact that rivers need clean flowing water and respecting the policies we have made. Then we must systematically introduce changes and avoid the oversights embedded in the present approach. The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems. In the present approach, nobody seems to want sediment which is a natural consequence of flow within the water cycle.To meet such an objective, we need to begin with a system of integrated knowledge that synthesises natural science, social science, and indigenous practices. By incorporating fields such as hydrology, ecology, social science-supported context-specific engineering, and indigenous knowledge and practices, we can take a comprehensive approach to water management challenges and solutions. Interdisciplinary approaches can build collaboration, innovation, and systemic decision-making and promote innovative water management for the benefit of both ecosystems and human societies.Do you think initiatives such as river clean up campaigns run by various groups help protect these waterways?I see such initiatives as manifestation of dissatisfaction of concerned citizens with the degradation of rivers and to bring about changes. In 1990, I was part of the Save Bagmati Campaign, which aimed to highlight the degrading state of the river. This campaign has taken many new forms, and citizen groups have begun campaigns in other rivers of Nepal. They however remain fragmented and ad-hoc. Similar campaigns in some countries have led to granting rights to rivers. In 2017, New Zealand recognised the Whanganui River and its tributaries as legal entities, acknowledging their physical and spiritual significance as âliving and indivisibleâ and ensuring their survival, health, and integrity to balance the needs of humans and nature. Promulgations like Living Indus (Pakistan), Namami Gange river-improvement programme (India) can offer lessons for a holistic water journey. The collective voice of concerned citizens for the integrity of rivers can be a powerful medium for policy and pathway changes. Nepal must also begin country-wide river restoration initiatives. We need more dialogue and conversation around water challenges and solutions.As cities turn into concrete jungles, their water tables are said to be receding alarmingly. You often propose redesigning our settlements and development infrastructure in a way that wouldnât disturb riversâ natural courses and catchment areas. Could you elaborate?South Asia is a region of waterscapes containing streams, ponds, wetlands, open spaces, floodplains, springs, and underground aquifers. Yet, our towns, cities, and infrastructure are planned, designed, and built to disregard water rather than live with it. As land-centric urban growth dominates, waterscapes temporarily seem to vanish but later water comes back. In Nepali we have a saying âIn twelve years a stream returnsâ. The present practice of urban development is obsessed with concretisation, making these areas impermeable. Rainwater, part of which would naturally infiltrate the ground, now immediately reaches the rivers already constrained by walls. The river at a downstream section immediately peaks and when the rainfall stops the river has very low discharge. Basic parameters, like the intensity of rainfall (mm per hour), are poorly recognised and used in design guidelines. The interaction of current urbanisation practices and increasing extreme rainfall, temperature and humidity rise spawned by climate change and urban heat island effects will make our urban areas as crucible of hazards, and unhealthy. A new urban future must harmoniously integrate nature, including water bodies and wetlands, and preserve natural land cover, including traditional ponds to promote groundwater recharge. It can be further achieved by preserving green open spaces, forests, gardens, permeable âspongeâ pavements, and natural waterfronts for healthier communities in sustainable cities. The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving riversâ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey.
