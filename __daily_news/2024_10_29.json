I would also like to reaffirm Nepal’s full support as you undertake the important responsibilities entrusted to you.\nWe extend our deepest appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis, the outgoing President, for his commendable leadership in successfully guiding the 78th Session of the Assembly.\nOur highest accolades are due to the Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres, for his tireless dedication to reinforcing multilateralism in tackling global challenges. \nI fondly recall your visit to Nepal last year, Mr. Secretary-General, and your message of peace from the sacred birthplace of Gautam Buddha, and the message of climate catastrophe of mountains from the Everest region. \nMr. President,\nThe world is at a watershed moment in history. \nThe contrast between rich and poor, harmony and hatred, and economic development and environmental destruction have never been as stark as they are today.\nBoth people and planet stand on the brink of climate catastrophe.\nGeopolitical rivalries are resurging. \nMilitary expenditures are skyrocketing along with an unabetted arms race. \nThe spectre of nuclear conflict looms larger than ever before.\nOn one hand, our economy remains frail, still grappling with the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, on the other, nationalism and protectionism have re-emerged, even before we have reaped the benefits that liberalisation and globalisation were meant to deliver. \nEven after three hundred years of industrialization and modernization journey, it is deeply troubling that in our so-called civilized world of 21st century, wealth and prosperity are concentrated mostly at the hand of Global North and the poverty and destitution are heavily concentrated in the Global South, particularly in the least developed countries (LDCs). \nTo overcome these travesties, we must demonstrate our leadership that promotes meaningful cooperation and collaboration. \nIt is only through collective will and unified action that we can turn the tide and usher in an era of enduring peace and shared prosperity for all.\nIn this context, the theme of this Session “Leaving No One Behind: Acting Together for the Advancement of Peace, Sustainable Development and Human Dignity for Present and Future Generations,” could not be more timely or relevant.\nWe have reaffirmed our commitment through the ‘Summit of the Future’ to build a safe, just, and sustainable world for both present and future generations.  \nThis pledge is embodied in the three pivotal documents we have adopted: Pact of the Future, Declaration on Future Generation, and the Global Digital Compact. \nWe must demonstrate our determination to implement these documents for the wellbeing of present and future generations.  \nMr. President,\nAllow me to underline that the principle of ‘Leaving No One Behind’ has long been the cornerstone of Nepal’s approach to development across all sectors.\nThis philosophy is enshrined in our Constitution which upholds the values of democracy by guaranteeing inclusivity, equality, justice, proportional representation, human rights, and social protection for the most vulnerable sections of society.\nI am determined to lead my country with my deep conviction to ‘comprehensive democracy’. \nFor me, comprehensive democracy ensures equal rights, equal access to opportunities, social justice, protects the vulnerable communities, and provides the security and dignity for all individuals. \nDemocracy goes far beyond the right of the people to choose their leaders. It is about leading the people towards prosperity and happiness so that they could feel highest level of dignity. \nAt the international level, sovereign equality and mutual respect constitute the bedrock of comprehensive democracy. \nThese principles are essential for building the frameworks of a just, inclusive, equitable, representative, and accountable global order. \nMr. President,\nAs a nation emerging from conflict, Nepal deeply understands the profound value of peace and political stability. \nSince the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006, Nepal has been firmly focused on completing the peace process at the earliest. \nImmediately after the formation of my government, parliament passed a Transitional Justice bill to settle transitional justice issue once and for all. \nWhile we implement the law, we will uphold victims’ rights, including truth and justice. \nWe will also use reparations and reconciliation to heal the wounds and scars of conflict period. We appreciate support from international community including the UN system in this regard. \nThe present government, formed by the collaboration of our two major political parties, is determined to secure stability while driving economic transformation for the inclusive and equitable prosperity to our people. \nAt this juncture, stability and economic transformation are paramount to us than our periodic competition in elections. \nWe have dedicated ourselves to realizing our national aspiration: ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali.’\nNepal will be graduating from its LDC status by 2026. We are diligently working towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 and aspire to become a developed country by 2043, despite facing significant economic headwinds. \nHowever, our path to achieving the SDGs remains fraught with difficulties. We are confronted with a substantial financial gap of about 24 billion US dollars to attain the 2030 Agenda. \nIn this backdrop, Nepal hosted the IDA 21 replenishment meeting last June, underscoring the crucial need for continued and enhanced support from the International Development Association along with other development partners. \nIn this pursuit, we strongly reiterate our call for enhanced, predictable, and sustained international support. \nMr. President,\nClimate change has emerged as the gravest threat to our planet, people, and prosperity. \nMy own country, Nepal, is particularly hard hit. We stand as one of the most vulnerable nations to climate change and are ranked as the 20th most disaster-prone country in the world.\nOf utmost concern is the alarming rate at which the pristine Himalayas, often referred to as the Third Pole, are losing their vast snow reserves. \nThis loss threatens water availability for billions of people living downstream, extending far beyond the borders of my country.\nNepal has hugely been contributing to the health of our planet through its forests, mountains and rivers. \nYet, despite these efforts, we continue to bear the brunt of climate change. In this context, we call for climate justice. \nOur mountains play a crucial role in regulating the climate and ecosystem of oceans, with their snow-fed rivers flowing down to the oceans. \nNepal’s Himalayas, as a natural climate stabiliser, help maintain a cooling system in a region situated in the hottest zone of the planet between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.\nGiven their significance, it is essential that the mountain agenda should receive due attention in climate negotiations. \nNepal is steadfast in its commitment to the Paris Agreement and aims to achieve net zero target by 2045, five year earlier than global target. \nAs climate change is a global challenge, it demands global action and collaborative efforts to address its widespread and cascading impacts.\nAdequate climate financing including ‘Loss and Damage’ fund is crucial to support climate-resilient measures and infrastructure for adaptation in developing countries not least in LDCs. \nMr. President,\nNepal’s land is blessed with the wisdom of enlightened great sages from both the Hindu and Buddhist faith, particularly the teachings of Gautam Buddha. \nThis profound legacy has shaped our world view to seek global harmony, peace, and security.\nThe values of love, harmony, tolerance, and empathy as espoused by Gautam Buddha, hold even greater relevance today than they did over two thousand five hundred years ago.\nBut, to our deep dismay, the world is increasingly distressed by division, suspicion, hatred, and enmity. \nNepal firmly believes that dialogue and diplomacy are the sole means to resolve conflicts, including in Ukraine and the Middle East. It is through love and compassion that hostility and hatred can be overcome, paving the way for lasting peace.\nOn the issue of Israel-Palestine conflict, we continue to support a two-state solution, where Israel and Palestine coexist peacefully and securely within internationally recognised borders, in line with relevant United Nations resolutions.\nWe must address the worsening humanitarian crises in regions such as Libya, Syria, Sudan, South Sudan, Yemen, and elsewhere.\nIt is vital to uphold the principles of sovereign equality, non-interference as enshrined in the UN Charter to ensure peace and stability. Consequently, we staunchly oppose any form of unilateral intervention or sanctions.\nMr. President,\nDisarmament and non-proliferation issues must be prioritised. \nNepal strongly advocates for the general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction. As the host country to the UN Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, Nepal firmly believes that regional efforts, including the Kathmandu Process, serve to strengthen the global disarmament regime. \nTechnology presents a double-edged sword, especially for the Least Developed Countries. \nIf we harness it, we can make remarkable progress. If we fail, it will leave us further behind. We call for technology transfer to enable us to catch up. \nMr. President,\nNepal has always adhered to a peaceful, independent, balanced, and non-aligned foreign policy, based on the principles of Panchsheel, the UN Charter, international law, and norms of world peace.\nWe conduct our foreign policy with profound belief in ‘Amity with All, Enmity with None.’\nNepal remains committed to further strengthening its close, cordial, and constructive relations with its immediate neighbours and beyond, rooted in the principles of mutual respect, sovereign equality, territorial integrity, non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, and peaceful co-existence.\nAs the largest contributor of troops and police to UN Peace operations, Nepal stands ready to further enhance its contribution to global peace and security.\nNepal believes it is our rightful call for having commensurate representation in the leadership positions, both at the UN headquarters and in the field, reflecting our significant contribution.\nMr. President,\nNepal firmly advocates for the reform of the UN System to make it more effective, democratic, transparent, and accountable.\nWe firmly believe that stronger multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core, is the only path forward to tackle the numerous global crises we face.\nWe echo a call for substantial reform of the global financial system, as aptly described it by Secretary-General Mr. António Guterres as “morally bankrupt.”  \nThe voice and representation of countries in special situations including the LDCs, Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs), and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) must be ensured. \nMr. President,\nNepal firmly upholds the belief that all human rights are universal, inalienable, indivisible, interdependent, and interrelated. \nIt is with this conviction that we have become a party to twenty-four international human rights-related conventions and protocols, including seven of the nine core instruments.\nWe are fully committed to promoting gender equality and ensuring equal rights for women. Nepal is making necessary legal arrangements for the full realisation of all human rights for women and girls including their sexual and reproductive health rights.\nProtection of the rights of migrant workers including their safety, security, dignity, and wellbeing, has always remained our priority.\nWe strongly advocate for safe, orderly, and regular migration to ensure that the benefits of migration are shared by all.\nFinally, Mr. President,\nThe world we inhabit is far from being perfect.\nYet, it is not all doom and gloom. We firmly believe that humankind is still capable enough to march ahead without compromising the prosperity and happiness of future generations.\nNone of the global challenges we are facing today have been imposed by aliens.  These are our own makings. Our own creations. \nTherefore, it is self-evident that by fostering global understanding, trust and cooperation, we can overcome these problems and challenges.  \nA just, inclusive, and equitable world order as well as sustained prosperity are attainable when we collaborate effectively. \nLet me resonate the wisdom of our ancient text, the ‘Maha Upanishad’ from around the sixth century BC, 'Vasudhaiva kutumbakam’: meaning ‘the whole world is one family.’\nWe not only hold this philosophy dearly, but we also act it on our everyday life. \nWith this constant conviction, Nepal is committed to playing its role to secure our shared aspiration of enduring peace, progress, and prosperity while leaving no one behind.\nThank you. \n","summary":"\n     The full text of statement delivered by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli at the 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) is as follows:Mr. President,\nYour Excellencies the Heads of State and Government,\nMr. Secretary General,\nDistinguished Delegates,\nLadies and Gentlemen. \nI stand here as a humble representative of thirty million proud Nepali people.\nAt the very outset, allow me to extend my sincere congratulations to you, Mr. President, and distinguished members of the Bureau on your well-deserved elections. I would also like to reaffirm Nepal’s full support as you undertake the important responsibilities entrusted to you.\nWe extend our deepest appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis, the outgoing President, for his commendable leadership in successfully guiding the 78th Session of the Assembly.\nOur highest accolades are due to the Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres, for his tireless dedication to reinforcing multilateralism in tackling global challenges. \nI fondly recall your visit to Nepal last year, Mr. Secretary-General, and your message of peace from the sacred birthplace of Gautam Buddha, and the message of climate catastrophe of mountains from the Everest region. \nMr. President,\nThe world is at a watershed moment in history. \nThe contrast between rich and poor, harmony and hatred, and economic development and environmental destruction have never been as stark as they are today.\nBoth people and planet stand on the brink of climate catastrophe.\nGeopolitical rivalries are resurging. \nMilitary expenditures are skyrocketing along with an unabetted arms race. \nThe spectre of nuclear conflict looms larger than ever before.\nOn one hand, our economy remains frail, still grappling with the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, on the other, nationalism and protectionism have re-emerged, even before we have reaped the benefits that liberalisation and globalisation were meant to deliver. \nEven after three hundred years of industrialization and modernization journey, it is deeply troubling that in our so-called civilized world of 21st century, wealth and prosperity are concentrated mostly at the hand of Global North and the poverty and destitution are heavily concentrated in the Global South, particularly in the least developed countries (LDCs). \nTo overcome these travesties, we must demonstrate our leadership that promotes meaningful cooperation and collaboration. \nIt is only through collective will and unified action that we can turn the tide and usher in an era of enduring peace and shared prosperity for all.\nIn this context, the theme of this Session “Leaving No One Behind: Acting Together for the Advancement of Peace, Sustainable Development and Human Dignity for Present and Future Generations,” could not be more timely or relevant.\nWe have reaffirmed our commitment through the ‘Summit of the Future’ to build a safe, just, and sustainable world for both present and future generations.  \nThis pledge is embodied in the three pivotal documents we have adopted: Pact of the Future, Declaration on Future Generation, and the Global Digital Compact. \nWe must demonstrate our determination to implement these documents for the wellbeing of present and future generations.  \nMr. President,\nAllow me to underline that the principle of ‘Leaving No One Behind’ has long been the cornerstone of Nepal’s approach to development across all sectors.\nThis philosophy is enshrined in our Constitution which upholds the values of democracy by guaranteeing inclusivity, equality, justice, proportional representation, human rights, and social protection for the most vulnerable sections of society.\nI am determined to lead my country with my deep conviction to ‘comprehensive democracy’. \nFor me, comprehensive democracy ensures equal rights, equal access to opportunities, social justice, protects the vulnerable communities, and provides the security and dignity for all individuals. \nDemocracy goes far beyond the right of the people to choose their leaders. It is about leading the people towards prosperity and happiness so that they could feel highest level of dignity. \nAt the international level, sovereign equality and mutual respect constitute the bedrock of comprehensive democracy. \nThese principles are essential for building the frameworks of a just, inclusive, equitable, representative, and accountable global order. \nMr. President,\nAs a nation emerging from conflict, Nepal deeply understands the profound value of peace and political stability. \nSince the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006, Nepal has been firmly focused on completing the peace process at the earliest. \nImmediately after the formation of my government, parliament passed a Transitional Justice bill to settle transitional justice issue once and for all. \nWhile we implement the law, we will uphold victims’ rights, including truth and justice. \nWe will also use reparations and reconciliation to heal the wounds and scars of conflict period. We appreciate support from international community including the UN system in this regard. \nThe present government, formed by the collaboration of our two major political parties, is determined to secure stability while driving economic transformation for the inclusive and equitable prosperity to our people. \nAt this juncture, stability and economic transformation are paramount to us than our periodic competition in elections. \nWe have dedicated ourselves to realizing our national aspiration: ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali.’\nNepal will be graduating from its LDC status by 2026. We are diligently working towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 and aspire to become a developed country by 2043, despite facing significant economic headwinds. \nHowever, our path to achieving the SDGs remains fraught with difficulties. We are confronted with a substantial financial gap of about 24 billion US dollars to attain the 2030 Agenda. \nIn this backdrop, Nepal hosted the IDA 21 replenishment meeting last June, underscoring the crucial need for continued and enhanced support from the International Development Association along with other development partners. \nIn this pursuit, we strongly reiterate our call for enhanced, predictable, and sustained international support. \nMr. President,\nClimate change has emerged as the gravest threat to our planet, people, and prosperity. \nMy own country, Nepal, is particularly hard hit.

People from different walks of life are calling for ditching the provinces altogether. But amid these calls, it is once again worth asking what has rendered the provinces ineffective. A small example from Karnali Province exemplifies the hurdles that provinces face. In 2019, the province came up with the idea of having an integrated administrative building to enhance its service delivery. But the project couldn’t get off the ground as the federal Ministry of Urban Planning never permitted the province to use the land at the proposed site. This case speaks volumes about the federal-provincial divide: If a province has to beg with the federal government for years to put up a building, what are its chances of getting more substantive rights and resources?The centralised approach is also evident in the federal level’s hesitation to adjust the police force at the provincial level. The federal government hasn’t even implemented the Police Personnel Adjustment Act endorsed by the federal parliament in 2019. The oversight extends to other critical areas like the passage of the Federal Civil Service Act. For example, the provinces demand that chief district officers function under provincial governments. Having their own police force and civil servants would have greatly helped with the functioning of the provincial governments—yet the leaders at the centre seem intent on blocking this all-important reform. Provinces also face obstacles in establishing autonomous institutions and managing resources locally, such as collecting fines and penalties in the transport sector.

The importance of Dashain for Nepalis living in and out of the country cannot be exaggerated. Actually, Dashain is not a pan-Hindu affair; however, over the years, high-caste hill rulers have constructed it—specifically the red tika—as a powerful symbol of national and cultural identity. I also celebrated Dashain this year, albeit in a secular way. I didn’t participate in any religious function or apply the red tika on my forehead; I put a black tika instead. My black tika is not against Dashain or the Hindu religion as such. It’s my symbolic protest against the persistently anti-Dalit rituals and customs associated with many festivals, including Dashain. I’d like to consider this my satyagraha. I will resume putting the red tika in Dashain once Dalits are treated equally in the communities, especially in the places of worship. Festivals perpetuate untouchability Following the age-old tradition, Nepal’s President Ram Chandra Paudel and Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli issued a statement this Dashain, praising the festival’s significance in strengthening social harmony and goodwill. Well, this observation may be true for others, but not Dalits. What Dashain has done is it has normalised and popularised caste hierarchy and the subordination of Dalits. The festival sees Dalits being openly excluded and humiliated at the holy sites, at homes and in neighbourhoods. There have been some changes over the years, of course, but many of the ancient customs and rituals that pulverise Dalit’s self-respect and dignity are still widely practised. It’s sad that although the Hindu monarchy has gone, its legacy continues to bite Dalit communities hard. And the democratically elected governments and parliaments have largely turned a blind eye to this persistent problem. They refuse to mention the fact that underneath public celebration and jubilation, many Dalits are deeply hurt. And no writer, journalist, analyst, or politician dares to speak against the tradition.That includes Dalit activists, too. Mainstream Dalit discourse is still shy about discussing issues related to religion and culture; all it focuses on is the constitution and law. The law isn’t that bad, but it’s difficult to precisely enforce it due to the strong religious and cultural resistance to change, as seen during Dashain rituals in Durga temples. Does the Goddess discriminate?Essentially, Dashain is Durga upasana—the worship of the goddess Durga, who symbolises power and victory over evil. This Dashain, I visited some historical temples of goddesses located near Kathmandu. I observed some of the rituals and also interviewed the priests and Dalits working there—mainly the temple drummers from the local Damai community. I also visited the temple of Palanchowk Bhagawati in Kavrepalanchowk District, which was built by King Mandev long before the formation of the modern Nepali state. The temple is famous among Nepalis, especially during occasions like Dashain. When I arrived, nitya puja—the daily worship by the priest–was going on. Devotees were waiting in a queue; they’d be allowed to worship after the puja was completed. A few Brahmins were reciting verses from Devi Bhagwat. The Newar priest was busy chanting inside the temple, ringing a little bell with one hand and offering flowers to the statue with the other.Just outside the temple, in front of the door, stood a Damai man beating his drum. His family has been performing for the goddess for many generations; however, his father, grandfather and ancestors have never been allowed into the temple.Once the nitya puja was over, the priest came out and offered red tika to his staff, well-wishers and locals. He also blessed them by sprinkling the holy water. But he didn’t come near the drummer, let alone apply the tika on his forehead! He was given the tika on a leaf. And that leaf, too, wasn’t given on his hand—it was thrown at his drum. All this happened in front of everybody. I later asked the drummer if he felt humiliated, and he replied no. He’s always treated as an untouchable at the temple door. Besides, he’s given the tail end of the sacrificed goats and buffaloes, symbolising his social rank and position. I was surprised to hear that even in such a big temple close to the capital city, local Dalits have no access. The priest would claim that there’s no discrimination there. In a sense, he’s right: He doesn’t ask anonymous devotees about their caste background. But the fact is that local Dalits, whom he and his staff recognise, can’t enter the temple. Next, I visited the temple of Goddess Bhairavi atop a hill in the historical fort of Nuwakot. The temple stood before the seven-storey durbar erected by Prithvi Narayan Shah. Talking to both the priest and a Damai man drumming and cleaning up the temple compound, I learnt that local Dalits aren’t allowed into the temple here, either. The same rule applies to smaller temples of goddesses popularly worshipped during Dashain. No Dalit was allowed to worship inside the temple in my village in northern Gorkha. The local upper castes rejected Dalit’s legal right to practise their religion on the grounds that the deity would be offended by physical contact with a lower caste. When angry, the fearsome and vengeful goddess could cause death and destruction in the community. What do you expect when people are blatantly discriminated against in the house of God? People would find it only natural to segregate Dalits in their homes, villages and towns. Herein lies the fundamental cause of the persistent caste domination, humiliation and violence across the country. Dashain is also guilty regarding its traditional political economy, namely the patron-client system. This system is highly exploitative and humiliating. Dalits are required to serve upper-caste people with their traditional skills throughout generations for little return. During festivals like Dashain, these tailors, blacksmiths and shoemakers visit their clients’ homes and eat and drink there. Dalit patrons aren’t allowed to enter the homes and eat outside separately. They cannot touch the water taps and must do their dishes. To humiliate them further, they are offered the tails and neck bones of the animals slaughtered for the Dashain celebrations. Way forward It’s not possible to describe here the many other ways in which big festivities like Dashain are used to legitimise the segregation and domination of Dalits through religious/spiritual and cultural methods. The most serious problem here is that nobody seems bothered by it. Marx was probably right: Religion does seem to act like opium. This opium has dulled the senses of the masses, the rulers, and, ironically, the victims themselves. It’s time we raised our voices against such a systematic violation of constitutional and legal provisions against caste discrimination. By applying the black tika on the most auspicious day of tika during Dashain, I’m asking a serious question on behalf of ordinary Dalits to both the state and religious authorities: Does our physical touch really offend your gods and goddesses so much?If it’s the gods themselves segregating us, we have no choice but to turn to a different religion in search of different, perhaps more egalitarian, gods. If it’s the people that segregate Dalits, shouldn’t these religious people abide by the modern law of the land? Does the constitution and law become null and void during religious rituals?  ","summary":"Many Nepalis may still be in a holiday mood as Dashain, the country’s most significant Hindu festival with the longest holiday, is just over.

Talking to both the priest and a Damai man drumming and cleaning up the temple compound, I learnt that local Dalits aren’t allowed into the temple here, either. The same rule applies to smaller temples of goddesses popularly worshipped during Dashain. No Dalit was allowed to worship inside the temple in my village in northern Gorkha. The local upper castes rejected Dalit’s legal right to practise their religion on the grounds that the deity would be offended by physical contact with a lower caste. When angry, the fearsome and vengeful goddess could cause death and destruction in the community. What do you expect when people are blatantly discriminated against in the house of God? People would find it only natural to segregate Dalits in their homes, villages and towns. Herein lies the fundamental cause of the persistent caste domination, humiliation and violence across the country. Dashain is also guilty regarding its traditional political economy, namely the patron-client system. This system is highly exploitative and humiliating. Dalits are required to serve upper-caste people with their traditional skills throughout generations for little return. During festivals like Dashain, these tailors, blacksmiths and shoemakers visit their clients’ homes and eat and drink there. Dalit patrons aren’t allowed to enter the homes and eat outside separately. They cannot touch the water taps and must do their dishes. To humiliate them further, they are offered the tails and neck bones of the animals slaughtered for the Dashain celebrations. Way forward It’s not possible to describe here the many other ways in which big festivities like Dashain are used to legitimise the segregation and domination of Dalits through religious/spiritual and cultural methods. The most serious problem here is that nobody seems bothered by it. Marx was probably right: Religion does seem to act like opium. This opium has dulled the senses of the masses, the rulers, and, ironically, the victims themselves. It’s time we raised our voices against such a systematic violation of constitutional and legal provisions against caste discrimination. By applying the black tika on the most auspicious day of tika during Dashain, I’m asking a serious question on behalf of ordinary Dalits to both the state and religious authorities: Does our physical touch really offend your gods and goddesses so much?If it’s the gods themselves segregating us, we have no choice but to turn to a different religion in search of different, perhaps more egalitarian, gods. If it’s the people that segregate Dalits, shouldn’t these religious people abide by the modern law of the land? Does the constitution and law become null and void during religious rituals?  "},{"hash":"03426a49d98f5893b9ecf93562ef0ac7f48ec8539e77f94d28417b8902bace68","title":"ai-for-teaching","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/10/28/ai-for-teaching","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/Shutterstock2399983083-1730131724.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1730073600000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"India is facing an employability crisis. The India Employment Report 2024 highlights that young people between the ages of 15 to 29 account for almost 83 percent of all unemployed people in India. Of these, nearly all are considered “educated unemployed”, having either had a secondary or tertiary education.Youth job participation is low, especially among women, with approximately 33.4 million women engaging in paid work in 2022. Around seven to eight million young people are projected to be added to the workforce every year, yet there are not enough dignified jobs. About 115 million more jobs are estimated to be needed by 2030 to absorb both underutilised workers and the incoming labour force. For those who do find employment, jobs are frequently informal, low-paying and may not match people’s qualifications, leading to disguised underemployment where their skills are underutilised.In all these cases, young people are unable to secure their goal of resilient and dignified livelihoods—jobs that are not vulnerable to automation and offer potential for socioeconomic growth, rather than maintaining the status quo based on class/caste/gender, such as delivery workers or domestic work.An education failureOne thing is clear: India’s education system has failed to prepare them for their future employment. A recent study with 35,000 young people aged 14 to 18 years across India revealed that while young people remain in school longer compared to 2017, there does not seem to have been much change in their foundational literacy and numeracy skills compared to earlier generations. In some instances they’re even going backwards. For example, 76.6 percent of 14 to 18-year-olds in 2017 could read a Std II level text compared to 73.6 percent in 2023.The emphasis on rote learning rather than foundational skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, communication and collaboration has resulted in a mismatch between the skills demanded by employers and the job readiness of youth entering the market, even those with a degree. There is a dire need to strengthen the foundational skills of Indian students to improve their job-readiness, right from their earliest years of school. And given the large number of people affected, any solutions will need to be able to be delivered across the country.To bridge this gap at scale, it is crucial to democratise access to education and training resources for students and youth. This could take the form of sparking a mass movement for hands-on education and moving away from a pedagogy that celebrates rote learning and memorisation. Leveraging recent advances in artificial intelligence can provide practical and customisable support and guidance for teachers and students at scale, and help youth be both resilient and future ready.Tech-based economyIndia is transitioning to an increasingly tech-based economy but without a clear pathway for developing more resilient job opportunities at scale. AI and automation are transforming industries, enhancing productivity but also spelling the end of more routine jobs. This uncertainty makes it critical that young people have strong skills to be able to re-learn and pivot in response to a changing market.Manufacturing, healthcare and agriculture in India require a workforce that can update and adapt its skills in keeping with changing tools and technologies. Giving youth strong foundational knowledge in STEAM subjects—science, technology, engineering, arts and maths—as well as specific skills in AI and robotics, will be crucial to them successfully navigating this shift.This calls for a fundamental shift in the way teaching and learning takes place in classrooms at all levels: K-12, higher education, vocational and beyond.Shifting educational practicesA culture of hands-on learning is being introduced in some classrooms in response. This involves learners collaborating on making, breaking and remixing materials and ideas so that they are strengthening their abilities to engage in problem-solving, connect interdisciplinary ideas and develop foundational critical thinking skills associated with the subjects they are otherwise passively reading.Organisations such as MakerGhat offer a transformative educational model designed to equip students with essential foundational skills such as problem-solving, confidence in their own abilities, critical thinking and collaborative communication, particularly in relation to STEAM topics. This approach leverages the power of hands-on making and tinkering.Most recently an AI large language model-powered solution nicknamed MakerDost has been introduced to shape how teachers and students engage in learning. MakerDost, a WhatsApp chatbot launched earlier this year, is designed to support hands-on learning for both teachers and students. For young learners, the programme offers activities aimed at building critical thinking, problem-solving, communication and collaboration skills. It also facilitates self-evaluation, provides skill certifications and offers exposure to emerging technologies. For teachers, the programme delivers syllabus-aligned, easy-to-execute lesson plans, customised for local context and language.The AI delivers in-situ educational content and nudges to the instructor, enabling them to be a better teacher and delivers custom learning pathways to the learner to enable them to adapt and pick up new skills in real time. Additionally, teachers benefit from extensive training and certification in experiential learning methods, receive in-class support and performance feedback and gain access to a community for sharing resources, tips and expert advice from seasoned makers.This approach is not without its challenges. It entails having basic access to mobile phones and the internet, and basic digital literacy. While the chatbot aims to support diverse languages, it depends on data being available for those languages. To ensure equitable access to resilient and dignified livelihoods, technology must be an integral part of strengthening capacity-building efforts and culture change at every level of the education system.Augment, not replaceSuch technology solutions seek to augment, but not replace, teachers or in-person capacity-building support. Ultimately, the aim of these solutions is to revitalise public infrastructure at the college, vocational (such as industrial training institutes and polytechnics) and school levels (through low-cost maker kits and Atal Tinkering Labs) to better prepare students for their future careers.An integral part of any AI deployment in the classroom should be a robust monitoring and evaluation framework, to track and assess the learning progress and skill development of students using scientific methods. By continuously monitoring educational outcomes, data-driven adjustments can be made to these programs and help understand implicit biases that may creep in. The outcome is to enhance programme and educator effectiveness while ensuring learning experiences are precisely tailored to meet the evolving needs of students. Such models are designed to be scalable and adaptable, making it suitable for implementation in diverse educational settings across the globe.The goal is to move India’s youth from being job-seekers to job-creators. In practice, this means developing a generation of youth who think critically about their lives and work, are proactive (and not reactive) to macro market conditions and changes in innovation, and are resilient lifelong learners who can always pick up new skills on-demand, anytime. This also means developing a cohort of entrepreneurs from and building products for the most underrepresented communities across the country.This nationwide movement-building effort can be a very practical reality within the next decade in India. It will require the development of rigorous research-backed pathways to evaluate and integrate generative AI tools that are foundationally designed to augment, sustain and amplify core human agency. This can both improve the agency of teachers in becoming better and more capable classroom facilitators and students in becoming better equipped at navigating complex and evolving career pathways in response to a changing labour market.-360info ","summary":"India is facing an employability crisis.

He again accused the Oli government of protecting the corrupt while selectively targeting opposition leaders for prosecution. Dahal re-emphasised how his government was toppled because it was preparing to take action against top Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders on corruption charges. Dahal and other top Maoist leaders who spoke before him lamented the ‘complete failure’ of the Oli government’s 100 days in office. Perhaps the most interesting part of Dahal’s statement was that the ruling parties need not fear that the Maoist Centre would try to topple the government. In fact, the party was now in a soul-searching phase and there was no question of the Maoists joining the government soon. That the Maoist supremo managed to say all this with a perfectly straight face speaks volumes about his chameleon-like ability to deceive folks—or at least about his belief that he can continue to do so indefinitely. His harangue on Saturday made one thing clear though: He still feels deeply hurt by the ‘deceit’ of KP Sharma Oli who ditched him to join hands with the Congress in order to cobble together a new ruling coalition. Nevermind that there is perhaps no one better at the deceit game than Dahal, who only four months ago used to publicly boast of the ‘magic number’ he had to be a long-term prime minister, apparently by endlessly playing off the Congress and the UML against each other. As Dahal held forth on Saturday, the pain of unexpectedly being booted out of office was also pasted all over his face. If Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba or UML chair Oli offered him to be the prime minister again, he would accept the offer in a heartbeat. No one is fooled by his commitment to soul-searching. He has played that card before. Even when he became the prime minister for the third time back in December 2022, he had promised to learn from his past mistakes and this time train all his focus on good governance and service delivery. Yet when we look back at his year and half of premiership, there is little to show for it.It is nothing but self-deception if Dahal believes people still heed his public utterances. Nothing he said on Saturday will change the public perception that Dahal is an ace manipulator whose sole goal is to connive his way back to power. Otherwise, it is hard to see how the Maoists can make a political comeback. Dahal continues to run the party like a personal fief. His successor as party chair is nowhere in sight. The party’s popular base continues to shrink and on current course, the outfit might be obliterated in the next election cycle. When the Maoist leader thundered from Tundikhel in the past, a sizable section of farmers, labourers, daily wage earners and all those who yearned for a break with the past paid some attention. Unlike the ‘bourgeois’ Congress and UML, the Maoists, with some justification, claimed to have championed the cause of the downtrodden. Now the very proposition sounds laughable. The Maoist Centre these days is a party without a core ideology or stable support base. With Dahal uninterested in putting in the hard work to gradually rebuild the organisation while champing at the bit to get back into Singhadurbar, the Maoists’ downslide will be hard to halt.  ","summary":"While addressing party workers in Kathmandu on Saturday, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, chairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre), the main opposition, stuck to a familiar script.

NATO said on Monday that thousands of North Korean troops were moving toward the front line.The development has alarmed Kyiv, which has said sanctions would not be enough and called for more weapons and an international plan to keep the North Korean troops at bay.South Korea, which remains technically at war with the nuclear-armed North decades after the 1950-1953 Korean War, also condemned the deployments, with officials in Seoul particularly worried about what Russia may be providing to Pyongyang in return.North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui arrived in Russia’s far east on Tuesday on her way to Moscow, Russian state media said. Russian state news agencies said it was not clear who Choe, making her second visit in six weeks, would meet in Moscow.The Kremlin said Putin had no plans to meet her. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Tuesday and said the North Korean moves were sending the war into an unprecedented phase.“The conclusion is clear - this war is becoming internationalized, extending beyond two countries,” Zelenskiy said on X.Yoon told Zelenskiy that if North Korea receives aid from Russia and is able to glean military experience and knowledge from its involvement in the war it would pose a “great threat” to South Korea’s security, according to a statement from South Korea's presidential office.South Korea has said it may start supplying weapons to Ukraine if North Korean troops joined Russia’s war. The Pentagon also said on Monday it would not impose new limits on Ukraine's use of US weapons if North Korea entered the fight.Russian President Vladimir Putin has not denied the presence of North Korean troops in the country.What role the North Korean troops may play is unclear. Analysts say their small number and possibly limited capabilities are unlikely to be decisive, but they could shore up Russian forces by providing manual labor or manning defensive positions.They are also likely to play a political role for Russia and North Korea, strengthening their hands in relations with China, which has an uneasy partnership with both countries, and sending a message to Washington and its allies, Western diplomats and analysts said.“The closer Moscow's ties to Pyongyang, the more leverage it expects over US allies as well as China,” Gilbert Rozman, of The Asan Forum, wrote for the US-based 38 North programme.Moscow needed a partner hostile to the status quo, wary of China but unwilling to antagonize it, and helpful in meeting arms or perhaps labor needs, he said.A few thousand North Korean troops will not change the course of the war so it may be a Russian attempt to underscore to the United States just how disruptive Moscow can be if it wants to be, said one diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.“Integrating North Korean troops into a very complex war machine is not easy. But using their presence to scare the United States and its allies in Asia is quite simple,” the diplomat said. “The key question is: to what extent is Russia actually changing its whole post-Soviet approach to North Korea?”Troops TrainingThe Ukraine conflict broke out when Russia invaded its neighbor in February 2022 and has since developed into a war of attrition largely fought along front lines in eastern Ukraine, with huge numbers of casualties on both sides.The Pentagon estimated 10,000 North Korean troops had been deployed to eastern Russia for training, up from an estimate of 3,000 troops last Wednesday.The military in Russia was trying to teach military terminology to the North Korean soldiers, South Korean lawmakers briefed by the country's spy agency said on Tuesday.Moscow was also continuing to provide technical support for North Korea’s attempts to field a fleet of spy satellites, the lawmakers said.For months North Korea has been providing Russia with short-range ballistic missiles, artillery shells, and other weapons, according to intelligence officials in the United States, South Korea, and Ukraine.Putin has said it is Russia’s business how to implement a partnership treaty he signed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June, under which the two countries agreed to support each other if one of them came under attack.South Korea has yet to change its stance against openly providing weapons to Ukraine, but Seoul expedited plans to share intelligence with NATO and dispatched a senior delegation to brief officials in Brussels and Kyiv. ","summary":"North Korea’s foreign minister arrived in Russia on Tuesday for talks as the Russia-Ukraine war appeared to take a dangerous new turn, with NATO and South Korea expressing alarm that North Korean troops could soon be joining in on Moscow’s side. NATO said on Monday that thousands of North Korean troops were moving toward the front line.The development has alarmed Kyiv, which has said sanctions would not be enough and called for more weapons and an international plan to keep the North Korean troops at bay.South Korea, which remains technically at war with the nuclear-armed North decades after the 1950-1953 Korean War, also condemned the deployments, with officials in Seoul particularly worried about what Russia may be providing to Pyongyang in return.North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui arrived in Russia’s far east on Tuesday on her way to Moscow, Russian state media said. Russian state news agencies said it was not clear who Choe, making her second visit in six weeks, would meet in Moscow.The Kremlin said Putin had no plans to meet her. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Tuesday and said the North Korean moves were sending the war into an unprecedented phase.“The conclusion is clear - this war is becoming internationalized, extending beyond two countries,” Zelenskiy said on X.Yoon told Zelenskiy that if North Korea receives aid from Russia and is able to glean military experience and knowledge from its involvement in the war it would pose a “great threat” to South Korea’s security, according to a statement from South Korea's presidential office.South Korea has said it may start supplying weapons to Ukraine if North Korean troops joined Russia’s war. The Pentagon also said on Monday it would not impose new limits on Ukraine's use of US weapons if North Korea entered the fight.Russian President Vladimir Putin has not denied the presence of North Korean troops in the country.What role the North Korean troops may play is unclear. Analysts say their small number and possibly limited capabilities are unlikely to be decisive, but they could shore up Russian forces by providing manual labor or manning defensive positions.They are also likely to play a political role for Russia and North Korea, strengthening their hands in relations with China, which has an uneasy partnership with both countries, and sending a message to Washington and its allies, Western diplomats and analysts said.“The closer Moscow's ties to Pyongyang, the more leverage it expects over US allies as well as China,” Gilbert Rozman, of The Asan Forum, wrote for the US-based 38 North programme.Moscow needed a partner hostile to the status quo, wary of China but unwilling to antagonize it, and helpful in meeting arms or perhaps labor needs, he said.A few thousand North Korean troops will not change the course of the war so it may be a Russian attempt to underscore to the United States just how disruptive Moscow can be if it wants to be, said one diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.“Integrating North Korean troops into a very complex war machine is not easy.

According to a notice from Chinese authorities sent yesterday, only vehicles carrying goods up to 13 tonnes are permitted to travel one-way.Following the Chinese authorities’ directive, Paudel said loaded containers will enter Nepal from Kerung in the morning and empty ones will return to Kerung in the evening. Customs official and spokesperson Rabindra Pyakurel said approximately 50 loaded containers and smaller vehicles are expected to enter Nepal from Kerung today.Thousands of tonnes of commercial goods are still stored in Kerung’s warehouses and in containers, as only a limited number of vehicles carrying loads below the weight limit are allowed to cross. Ramhari Karki, President of the Nepal-China Himalayan Cross-Border Trade Association, revealed that over 600 containers are waiting in Kerung, noting that fruit containers typically weigh up to 20 tonnes, making the 13-tonne weight limit insufficient.This delay has led to financial strain, as traders have had investments tied up for an extended period. Transport costs have more than doubled, with the charge for delivering a container to Kathmandu rising from Rs90,000 to Rs200,000. The Chinese authorities have set border crossing times between 8:00 am and 11:00 am for imports from Kerung and 4:00 pm onwards for exports. The interim period is allocated for road repairs.Extensive damage to roads has rendered some areas impassable, with parts entirely swept into the Bhotekoshi River. Before Dashain, with assistance from Chinese security personnel, Nepalese citizens had to walk from Kerung to the border due to the impassable roads.Perishable goods such as apples, mangoes, kiwis, walnuts, and garlic have suffered significant losses due to spoilage during the delay, costing Nepali traders millions. With the resumed movement of containers, traders hope to reach the market before Chhath, although the opportunity to sell holiday-targeted goods has mostly passed.

The domestic job market is in the process of adapting to this new environment, which in turn is raising the eligibility threshold for job seekers, experts said.A joint report released recently by Peking University’s National School of Development and recruitment portal Zhaopin shows that AI-related job openings surged in the first half of the year.Positions related to natural language processing increased 111 percent year-on-year in the first six months on Zhaopin, while those related to deep learning increased 61 percent. The average monthly salary for these jobs was around 24,000 yuan ($3,370).Hu Jiayin, an associate professor at the National School of Development, noted that it is not easy to get AI-related jobs, because they have higher entry threshold.“Several positions related to natural language processing and deep learning have higher requirements in terms of education and work experience. The eligibility criteria have been rising, so it’s necessary to get higher education degrees and richer work experience if job seekers wish for employment in the AI sector,” she said.In 2022, United States-based OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT and other large language models — AI systems that are capable of comprehending and generating human language by processing vast amounts of text data — caught the domestic job market off guard.The massive influence of AI has already reduced some clerical and customer service-based positions, Zhaopin said, and the joint report concluded that job seekers must continuously improve their skill set in order to remain competitive in the rapidly changing employment market.Another report, released by the World Bank earlier this month, also mentioned the impact of AI on jobs, particularly in East Asia and the Pacific region.“Displacement effects are beginning to be felt in occupations involving primarily routine cognitive tasks that involve standard optimization and low social interaction, and gradually to occupations involving nonroutine cognitive tasks,” the World Bank report said.“Malaysia and China stand out as countries with a relatively high share of people employed in nonroutine cognitive tasks who may be equipped to benefit from complementarities with AI,” it added.Xu Yifan, 27, a postgraduate student at Shanghai University of Engineering Science, said he is optimistic about a career in the AI sector because he is focusing on the research of federated learning, a state-of-the-art AI tool mainly used in data security and distributed data processing.“It’s undeniable that fast-developing AI technologies have greatly shocked traditional industries and the job market. I think the knowledge and skills I’ve acquired, especially in federated learning, will work to my advantage. AI is not just a technology-driven innovation tool, it is also a force reshaping society and the economy,” he said.Xu said that to cope with the ever-changing revolution brought by AI, it is necessary for him to keep learning. “New algorithms, tools and applications come up all the time, which require us to be learners for life. A certain single skill will not work forever, so we need to train ourselves to be all-arounders, combining AI knowledge with other skills to foster competitiveness in such a complicated job market,” he added.Li Qiang, vice-president of Zhaopin, said that job seekers need to be more flexible and have the ability to keep learning new things, in order to adjust to a life and career based on AI.“It is important for people to be sensitive to AI-related knowledge and development and to embrace the integration of such knowledge with their current professions, such as healthcare or finance,” Li said.“Learning some soft skills that AI lacks, such as teamwork and communication, and becoming involved in or leading some AI projects to gain more practical experience, if possible, would also be beneficial,” he added.Hu, from Peking University, emphasized that no job seeker or employee could be a bystander in the AI storm. For average employees, it’s important to learn to use some AI tools while enhancing soft skills, including their ability to innovate, organize and communicate, she said.-In Association with ANN ","summary":"As artificial intelligence continues to make headlines, Chinese internet companies are busy scouting for talent that can take them to the forefront of this transformational technology.

The eligibility criteria have been rising, so it’s necessary to get higher education degrees and richer work experience if job seekers wish for employment in the AI sector,” she said.In 2022, United States-based OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT and other large language models — AI systems that are capable of comprehending and generating human language by processing vast amounts of text data — caught the domestic job market off guard.The massive influence of AI has already reduced some clerical and customer service-based positions, Zhaopin said, and the joint report concluded that job seekers must continuously improve their skill set in order to remain competitive in the rapidly changing employment market.Another report, released by the World Bank earlier this month, also mentioned the impact of AI on jobs, particularly in East Asia and the Pacific region.“Displacement effects are beginning to be felt in occupations involving primarily routine cognitive tasks that involve standard optimization and low social interaction, and gradually to occupations involving nonroutine cognitive tasks,” the World Bank report said.“Malaysia and China stand out as countries with a relatively high share of people employed in nonroutine cognitive tasks who may be equipped to benefit from complementarities with AI,” it added.Xu Yifan, 27, a postgraduate student at Shanghai University of Engineering Science, said he is optimistic about a career in the AI sector because he is focusing on the research of federated learning, a state-of-the-art AI tool mainly used in data security and distributed data processing.“It’s undeniable that fast-developing AI technologies have greatly shocked traditional industries and the job market. I think the knowledge and skills I’ve acquired, especially in federated learning, will work to my advantage. AI is not just a technology-driven innovation tool, it is also a force reshaping society and the economy,” he said.Xu said that to cope with the ever-changing revolution brought by AI, it is necessary for him to keep learning. “New algorithms, tools and applications come up all the time, which require us to be learners for life. A certain single skill will not work forever, so we need to train ourselves to be all-arounders, combining AI knowledge with other skills to foster competitiveness in such a complicated job market,” he added.Li Qiang, vice-president of Zhaopin, said that job seekers need to be more flexible and have the ability to keep learning new things, in order to adjust to a life and career based on AI.“It is important for people to be sensitive to AI-related knowledge and development and to embrace the integration of such knowledge with their current professions, such as healthcare or finance,” Li said.“Learning some soft skills that AI lacks, such as teamwork and communication, and becoming involved in or leading some AI projects to gain more practical experience, if possible, would also be beneficial,” he added.Hu, from Peking University, emphasized that no job seeker or employee could be a bystander in the AI storm. For average employees, it’s important to learn to use some AI tools while enhancing soft skills, including their ability to innovate, organize and communicate, she said.-In Association with ANN "},{"hash":"ad77aaede94a1f53f7c89fa4d384d342fef79b8ee1079bfdc4d4567a03c79d00","title":"south-korea-to-hold-talks-with-nato-allies-amid-north-korea-troops-in-russia","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/world/2024/10/29/south-korea-to-hold-talks-with-nato-allies-amid-north-korea-troops-in-russia","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/world/137gyi1y8zmpmtguaisnpmgzebyiujoueo7lwahbqr0w0-1730185883.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1730160000000,"source":"kp","category":"world","content":"South Korea is set to convene its first 2+2 foreign and defence ministerial meeting with the United States in more than three years, paired with inaugural 2+2 talks with Canada, at a critical juncture marked by concerns of possible North Korean troop deployment to the Ukraine-Russia combat zone.The high-stakes meetings will take place in a pivotal week of diplomacy and include top diplomats and defence leaders from founding NATO members — staunch allies of Ukraine since Russia’s invasion.South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will hold the sixth South Korea-US Foreign and Defense Ministerial Meeting, scheduled for Thursday in Washington.The upcoming meeting marks the first 2+2 talks between the treaty allies since March 2021 — held two months after the Biden administration took office — and notably the first 2+2 talks under the Yoon Suk Yeol administration.“During the meeting, ministers from both countries will engage in in-depth, comprehensive discussions on Korean Peninsula affairs, Korea-US alliance cooperation and regional issues within the framework of a global comprehensive strategic alliance, and will adopt a joint statement reflecting the outcomes of the talks,” the Foreign Ministry in Seoul announced Monday.“Minister Cho’s trip to the US serves as an opportunity to reaffirm the unwavering and steadfast Korea-US alliance amid the grave security situation on the Korean Peninsula and to engage in close consultations on key alliance pending issues, including the recent deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea,” the ministry added.Cho will hold a separate meeting with Blinken on Thursday to discuss “how South Korea and the US can cooperate on North Korean issues,” as well as the South Korea-US alliance and trilateral cooperation among South Korea, the US and Japan, the Foreign Ministry stated.The annual Security Consultative Meeting, a defence ministerial dialogue between South Korea and the US, is scheduled for Wednesday.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) announced that the Montreal Convention liability limits for death, injury, delays, baggage, and cargo issues will increase on December 28, 2024. Nepal implemented the Montreal Convention for the first time on December 15, 2018. Millions of air passengers worldwide are entitled to compensation for yearly flight delays, cancellations, and overbooking. Because passengers are unaware of their rights and airlines make it so hard to get their money, less than 2 percent receive their flight compensation, according to a study. Here is what you need to know about the Montreal Convention and your air passenger rights. Claim what you owe.What is the Montreal Convention 1999 or MC99?The Montreal Convention is a multilateral treaty adopted by a diplomatic meeting of International Civil Aviation Organisation member states in 1999. Ratified in 1999 and enacted in 2003, the Montreal Convention was a successor to the Warsaw Convention 1929.Formally known as the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, the Montreal Convention 1999 (or MC99) has established a comprehensive and unified framework for the international carriage of passengers, baggage, and cargo by air. It introduced several elements to balance the interests of travellers, cargo shippers, and the aviation industry. The Convention sets liability limits for airlines, ensuring fair compensation for consumers in cases of injury, death, delay, baggage and cargo issues. ICAO has informed the 140 State Parties that the limits will increase in line with the Convention’s built-in review mechanism, which adjusts for inflation every five years. This ensures that passenger and cargo compensation remains appropriate over time. This is the fourth review since the treaty came into force in 2003. \"ICAO continues to advocate for the universal ratification of MC99,\" said Juan Carlos Salazar, the ICAO secretary general, in a statement. \"This Convention is fundamental in protecting consumer interests in international air travel. By promoting harmonisation and codification of rules governing international carriage by air, MC99 benefits passengers and cargo shippers while enabling the unified and equitable development of air services.\"What are the liability provisions?The liability limits are indicated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), a unit of account defined by the International Monetary Fund. For indicative purposes, 1 SDR has been valued at US$ 1.33318 on October 18, 2024. What are the revisions? The limits will be revised as follows: 1. The death or bodily injury limit will increase from 128,821 SDRs to 151,880 SDRs (about US$202,500). It originally was 100,000 SDRs in 2003. 2. The limit for passenger transport delays will rise from 5,346 SDRs to 6,303 SDRs (about US$8,400). 3. The limit for baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay will increase from 1,288 SDRs to 1,519 SDRs (about US$2,000). 4. The limit for cargo destruction, loss, damage, or delay will rise from 22 SDRs to 26 SDRs per kilogram (about US$35). ICAO has invited the States Parties to MC99 to make provisions as necessary in accordance with their domestic legal requirements, to give full effect to the revised limits as of December 28, 2024.What’s the case of Nepal?The Montreal Convention allows air passengers on international flights to claim compensation for damages caused by travel disruptions and luggage problems. Since travellers in Nepal are not aware that they can file a compensation claim, many passengers protest at the airport against the delays, cancellations, baggage damages and other issues caused by the airlines' negligence. For example, if the passengers' baggage is damaged, under the rule, passengers can claim up to $2,000 with the particular airline.However, the Montreal Convention waives the airline’s liability in cases where extraordinary circumstances caused the flight disruption. Such cases include adverse weather, Air Traffic congestion and restrictions, lightning strikes, bird strikes, strikes at the airport, medical emergencies, security threats, and political unrest, etc. You can also claim when … ?On November 30 last year, Flight RA229 of the state-owned Nepal Airlines flew two hours before its scheduled departure, leaving 31 passengers stranded at midnight at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport. The reason for the rushed departure was the flight’s VVIP status. Then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal was on the same flight. The flight was planned for Dahal, who left for Dubai leading the Nepali delegation to the 28th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 28). According to experts, the case is severe negligence by the airline company, and passengers can still file compensation cases as per the Convention.The MC99 extends a time frame within which a passenger can claim compensation for damages – up to two years following the occurrence of the flight disruption. If the claim pertains to damaged, lost, or delayed luggage, it's imperative to report the issue expeditiously. Claims for damaged baggage should be filed within seven days, while claims for delayed baggage must be initiated within 21 days. If your bags remain unclaimed for more than 21 days and are considered lost, you still can file a claim within two years.Where to file the claims?According to Vijay Shrestha, vice-president of administration at Himalaya Airlines, passengers can file a compensation claim by filling out a “property irregularity form” at the airline office or the airline’s ground handling agent in any destination airport.Luggage will be categorised as lost if the airline cannot trace it for 21 days from filing the property irregularity report. All claims shall be substantiated with an itemised list of contents, description, age, and proof of purchase or ownership of all items. At Kathmandu airport, passengers can file compensation claims for loss, delay, or damage at the lost and found unit of Nepal Airlines. “The compensation provision used to be printed on tickets, but since airlines issue e-tickets nowadays, passengers can go to the ‘contract of carriage by air’ on the airline's website to know the information regarding the loss, delay, or damage,” said Shrestha. Is MC99 applicable to domestic airlines? The MC99 makes only international airlines liable in case of passenger death or injury.A year after Nepal adopted the MC99, preparations for adopting a similar law started but could not proceed, although the draft had been prepared.Tourism ministry officials say the process was stalled multiple times as governments changed. Since 2019, there have been six fatal plane and helicopter crashes that killed 130 people, and all the families of the victims have been barred from a justifiable compensation that would be $100,000 as per the proposed provisions.The air carriers’ liability and insurance draft bill for domestic airlines has been sent to the finance ministries for their comments before being tabled by the Cabinet. After the Cabinet nod, the bill will be tabled in Parliament.What’s the provision in the proposed domestic law? As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost and damaged shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the airlines, it says. The cargo damage is limited up to $5,000.The compensation for the hand baggage, if lost or damaged, shall be $400.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons.

Amid the festive atmosphere, Matrika Bhandari sat on the terrace with his five-year-old son, Soham. Soham tugged at his father’s sleeve, eager to show him the kites his cousins were flying outside.However, Bhandari’s attention was elsewhere—he was engrossed in his phone, scrolling through TikTok videos.After several failed attempts to get his father’s attention, Soham gave up. He wandered over to a corner of the room, found his tablet, and started playing a game. Later that evening, during dinner, Bhandari complained to his relatives, “I just don’t know what to do with Soham. Children of today can’t live without phones… He’s always glued to his tablet!”Ironically, as he voiced this concern, he was checking a WhatsApp message on his phone. What Bhandari failed to notice was the reflection of his habits in his son’s growing attachment to screens.It’s the time of festivals again, and familiar scenes of families and relatives coming together are playing out. Yet another common sight will be children and teenagers huddled in the living room, their heads bowed over their phones. Conversations will often start with parents and relatives lamenting that children have become ‘addicted’ to their phones—a topic that is sure to come up at almost every Nepali family gathering this festive season.However, what often goes unnoticed is that in many such living room gatherings, it’s not only the younger generation immersed in screens; their parents are just as preoccupied.It’s common to see parents handing their phones to children to keep them entertained or distracted while they focus on work, or playing videos like ‘Baby Shark’ during mealtime to help their kids eat. And the parents are busy with social media.Research says parents’ excessive use of phones influences their children’s screen habits—and this link is often overlooked.This isn’t without consequences. A study published in PubMed found that greater child and parental exposure to electronic media was linked to a smaller expressive vocabulary at age 2 and negatively impacted language development by age 5. Another study involving parents of 421 Estonian children between the ages of 2.5 and 4 years old revealed that parents who spent more time on screens had children who also used screens more frequently. These children exhibited poorer skills in grammar and vocabulary. The study, which was published in the journal ‘Frontiers’, emphasises the importance of parent-child verbal interactions in language development.Consider Dipika Jha from Maitighar, Kathmandu, a mother who once enjoyed imaginative tea parties with her daughter Kenjal. By the time Kenjal turned four, Dipika’s attention had shifted to her phone during their playtime. As Dipika scrolled through her social media feeds, Kenjal’s attempts to engage her mother grew increasingly desperate. Over time, Kenjal stopped trying and became increasingly silent. It was only a year later through Kenjal’s teacher that Dipika realised that her emotional absence was stunting Kenjal’s emotional development.Kenjal has begun to mimic her mother’s detachment. This lack of parental engagement was diminishing her ability to express emotions and build meaningful relationships.Research supports this growing detachment. The 2024 study published in ‘Frontiers’ also found that children’s emotional intelligence is negatively impacted by their parents’ phone use. When parents use screens in the presence of their children, the outward appearance of distraction sends a powerful message, “I’m not present.” This leads to what researchers call ‘still face,’ an expressionless appearance that can further inhibit a child’s ability to develop emotional skills.This parental ‘technoference’—the interference of technology in routine parent-child interactions—has far-reaching effects. According to a 2023 cohort study published in ‘JAMA Network’, children whose parents frequently used phones reported higher levels of anxiety, attention issues, and hyperactivity. The study, which tracked over 1,300 children aged 9-11, found that parental phone use disrupts important emotional and social cues, contributing to developmental delays in children. However, in today’s fast-paced work environment and digital landscape, many parents feel they have no choice.Laxmi Upadhyay, a grocery shop owner and a parent of a nine-year-old from Lalitpur, says, ‘These days, everything from paying bills to shopping and work is tied to our phones. It may seem like parents are always on their phones, but it’s hard to avoid using them.”Psychologist Bina Shrestha from “Mankaa Kura” (a mental health platform) says the solution isn’t for parents to avoid phones entirely, but tailoring the content they consume and their device habits. She adds, “With work now tied to gadgets and phones, especially for parents juggling jobs and further studies, people spend a lot of their time on devices. In the past, it was easier to separate work from home, but now, phones blur that line, leading to a lack of emotional and social connection for children.”According to her, from a child’s perspective, it often seems like their parents are constantly on their phones, and with the already poor communication patterns in many Nepali families, this lack of interaction creates a gap in parent-child relationships.Anuja, a 16-year-old from Kalanki, has seen this play out firsthand. Anuja (who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) shared how her father, a reporter for an online media outlet, is always busy with his phone or laptop, even during family time. “Even at home, during dinner or family time, his attention is divided between us and his devices. I miss having real conversations with him, and now my eight-year-old brother is following the same habit, constantly playing video games on his phone”, said Anuja.The effects of this detachment are not only emotional but also behavioural, says psychologist Shrestha. Children, like Soham and Kenjal, mimic their parents’ screen habits, reinforcing a cycle of phone dependency that starts early and persists into adolescence. Dangers though don’t end with emotional detachment.With greater exposure to the internet comes heightened vulnerability. Research conducted by Voice of Children and KNH Germany in 2023 showed that 38.6 percent of girls and 32.3 percent of boys reported receiving sexual calls and messages.In fiscal year 2023-24, the Nepal Cyber Bureau recorded 635 cases of cyber violence involving children, up from 176 cases in fiscal year 2022-23—for a 260.8 percent rise.As parents manoeuvre the digital age, the responsibility of guiding their children through it has never been more critical. The irony of parents lamenting their children’s phone addiction while mirroring the same behaviour is a cycle that must be broken. Children are not born obsessed with screens—they learn it from the adults around them, says Shrestha. According to Shrestha, parents should establish work timetables, just as children have study schedules, to help kids understand when it’s time for work and when it’s family time. Parents should also explain to their children the purpose behind their phone or gadget usage. “As a work-from-home parent, I’ve made it a point to help my young child understand that when I’m on my phone, I’m working, as this differentiation is crucial for young children to learn….Otherwise, children may simply mimic our behaviour of spending time on gadgets and become isolated.”Many parents fall into the habit of giving their phones to their children to keep them occupied while they manage household chores. Shrestha warns that this practice diminishes critical parent-child interaction. Instead, she suggests watching appropriate and fun content together, which can create bonding and interaction for the emotional and language development of children.“Regulating screen time shouldn’t solely focus on limiting children’s usage; parents also need to manage their device habits. Children imitate parent’s behaviour so parents should model healthy interactions with technology”, she adds.

The death toll of the calamity crossed 200, thousands have been homeless, and the damage it has inflicted upon the national economy is still to be fully assessed. When disasters strike Nepal, the presence of the government in rescue and relief operations is usually symbolic: An earthmoving equipment here, an army unit there, or a team of bewildered police personnel at some places trying to cope with emergencies that they are neither trained nor equipped to handle. In a coping mechanism that is charitably called “the resilience of Nepali people”, the affected population is often back on its feet through individual efforts. Even though somewhat muted, the Hindu novena of Dashain was celebrated, and the preparations for the five-day-long Tihar festivities have already begun. Several squatters managed to reassemble their damaged shanties themselves in the floodplains soon after the rains subsided. Houses submerged due to overflowing drains in low-lying localities have been cleaned up through individual and community efforts. But in a testament to the apathy of all three tiers of the republican order in the country, debris deposited by floods continue to decompose in the riverbed, and plastic waste lifted by torrents still flutter like flags from branches of trees and lamp posts all along the Bagmati Corridor. Had the federal government considered it an emergency, an army team would have been deployed to clear the garbage from roads along the riverbed in the Kathmandu Valley within few days. The provincial government of Bagmati needed no new laws to show its presence during a calamity—even a symbolic act of the chief minister working with a shovel would have conveyed an uplifting message. Shamed into action, the Lalitpur metropolitan government has called upon its citizens to volunteer for the clean-up drive. It’s still not too late for the celebrity Mayor Balendra Shah to follow the lead of his senior colleague.Cultural rootsDespite loud claims to the contrary, almost all religions with their “packaged superstitions”—including political religions such as communism and free-market fundamentalism—are regressive, and Hinduism is no exception. With an established tradition of karma, vacuous pride in traditions and institutionalised inequality of caste hierarchy, it is harder for a republican order to take root in societies where the Sanatan Dharma is the dogma. If Hindu monarchs of the past were avatars of Vishnu, elected leaders seem to get away with characterisations such as “Durga astride a tiger” or a human being “not born biologically”. One doesn’t question a divine being even when the person must acquire political legitimacy through the popular mandate of lesser mortals. The transactional relationships of patronage and support between politicians and their followers aren’t uncommon, but the unquestioned loyalty of the herd to its shepherd perhaps owes its origin to the tribal instinct and religious beliefs extant in many societies.It seems the citizenry in Nepal get so little from their government and yet don’t complain because they have been conditioned to demand nothing from the representatives other than some personal favours in lieu of allegiance—an appointment, a contract or some assistance in favourably resolving a dispute—once in a while. Let alone integrity, even civility and decency are seldom expected from politicos who exercise control over the resources and instruments of the state. When the citizenry is apathetic, Premier Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli can easily get away with a questionable largesse from an oligarch under investigation to build the headquarters of the ruling party. Despite his past entanglements—OMNI scandal, links with Yeti Group, Giri Bandhu land swap case, profligate actions and outrageous outbursts—Sharma Oli remains the unquestioned supremo of the CPN-UML and an idolised chieftain of the Khas-Arya ethnonationalists across party lines.Former Deputy Prime Minister and Chair of Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), Rabi Lamichhane, has been arrested and remanded into custody for further investigations of serious charges on judicial orders. The Supreme Court had once removed him from the office of the deputy prime minister and ousted him from the membership of the parliament for violating citizenship laws. In any other country, it would have meant the end of a political career, but in the land of “Never ending peace and love” that is Nepal, Lamichhane continues to command the fierce loyalty of White Shirts and “People Like Us” (PLUs) of the urban middle class.In a society where piety is more prevalent than virtue and rituals are more valued than rationality, it’s extremely difficult to institutionalise republican principles of liberty, equality, fraternity and secularity. No wonder followers blindly line up in support of their petty, populist and ‘elected monarchs’ such as Sharma Oli, Lamichhane, Shah, or even the Mayor of Dharan sub-metropolitan city Harka Sampang. In a deeply rooted culture of piety and fealty, a political manipulator can get away with anything as long as he—leadership is a male bastion—manages to dupe the flock with his bluster and bombast.Economic compulsionsHardcore adherents of republicanism may disagree, but just as authoritarianism is intrinsic to monarchism, financial improprieties are integral to almost all electoral systems that reward their winners with enormous authority to disburse concessions and distribute freebies to oligarchs who have funded their rise to power.

He had been a victim of the monkey menace for years. But these days Magar of Phek Dangsinghdanda, Ribdikot rural municipality-8 is not much worried. He plans to earn Rs700,000 from the same land which until two years ago yielded nothing because monkeys, including other wild animals, ate up all the crops. Some farmers even left the village.Magar's life suddenly changed after he started growing chillies. Monkeys don’t like chillies and they don't even come close to the crop. Till October, he sold chillies worth Rs 350,000 and plans to double the income by the end of this year. He has cultivated round chillies on three ropanies of land.“Previously, the crops were destroyed by monkeys, porcupines, boars and other animals. My income was just zero two years back,” said Magar. “This year, I expect a good earning as the chilli variety I’ve grown is highly demanded in the market.”Bishnu Bahadur Karki from Bhairabstan, Ribdikot rural municipality-4 hopes to earn Rs800,000 this year from round chilies. He has already made nearly a half of that. He still plans to earn Rs450,000 from the sales of round chillies.Karki, who has cultivated round chillis on six ropanis, said that the price of round chillies has nearly doubled this year.“We have not only got the value for our products, but market access too,” said Karki. “As the price is fixed in advance, it is less risky for farmers.”Besides Magar and Karki, nearly 1,500 farmers from Ribdikot rural municipality-8 are making an income from the crop. Ribdikot, once known for ginger production, now sees a future in round chilli cultivation.Round chillies were primarily cultivated in Ilam, Panchthar, Dhakuta of the east. Four years ago, round chillies were planted in Ribdikot as a trial but later the rural municipality earned more than Rs60 million from the commodity, and encouraged more farmers to grow the crop in a commercial way.With the increase in the value of round chilli this year, farmers easily managed the expenses for their festivities.“We used to take loans to celebrate festivals. But with the round chilli farming boom, we need no loans from anyone,” said Sita Khamcha of Phake, Ribdikot rural municipality. She hopes to earn Rs500,000 from round chillies.Last year, round chillies fetched Rs150 per kg but this year the minimum price has been set at Rs220 per kg.

Narayan Bahadur GC, a former ward chairman, is the director of Palpa Ribdikot Akabare Khursani Udyog.

Production of green chillies starts from May. This facilitation has encouraged farmers to engage in round chilli farming, said Ranjib Kunwar, manager of Palpa Ribdikot Akabare Khursani Udhyog.Kunwar said that most of the farmers bring their chilies to the factory. The farmers who do not take round chillies to the factory also make transactions of Rs10.5 million separately by selling them in the market. Traders supply round chillies to Butwal, Bhairahawa, Tansen and Pokhara.Palpa Ribdikot Akabare Khursani Udhyog sells red round chillies to noodle producers.Farmers of Ribdikot hope to earn Rs60 million from round chillies this year.So far, farmers have already sold round chillies for more than Rs30 million.Though the rural municipality supported round chilli cultivation in initial days, lately it has been providing subsidies in seeds only. ","summary":"Until two years ago, growing crops was a big challenge for farmer Jit Bahadur Khamcha Magar of Palpa in western Nepal. He had been a victim of the monkey menace for years. But these days Magar of Phek Dangsinghdanda, Ribdikot rural municipality-8 is not much worried. He plans to earn Rs700,000 from the same land which until two years ago yielded nothing because monkeys, including other wild animals, ate up all the crops. Some farmers even left the village.Magar's life suddenly changed after he started growing chillies. Monkeys don’t like chillies and they don't even come close to the crop. Till October, he sold chillies worth Rs 350,000 and plans to double the income by the end of this year. He has cultivated round chillies on three ropanies of land.“Previously, the crops were destroyed by monkeys, porcupines, boars and other animals. My income was just zero two years back,” said Magar. “This year, I expect a good earning as the chilli variety I’ve grown is highly demanded in the market.”Bishnu Bahadur Karki from Bhairabstan, Ribdikot rural municipality-4 hopes to earn Rs800,000 this year from round chilies. He has already made nearly a half of that. He still plans to earn Rs450,000 from the sales of round chillies.Karki, who has cultivated round chillis on six ropanis, said that the price of round chillies has nearly doubled this year.“We have not only got the value for our products, but market access too,” said Karki. “As the price is fixed in advance, it is less risky for farmers.”Besides Magar and Karki, nearly 1,500 farmers from Ribdikot rural municipality-8 are making an income from the crop. Ribdikot, once known for ginger production, now sees a future in round chilli cultivation.Round chillies were primarily cultivated in Ilam, Panchthar, Dhakuta of the east. Four years ago, round chillies were planted in Ribdikot as a trial but later the rural municipality earned more than Rs60 million from the commodity, and encouraged more farmers to grow the crop in a commercial way.With the increase in the value of round chilli this year, farmers easily managed the expenses for their festivities.“We used to take loans to celebrate festivals. But with the round chilli farming boom, we need no loans from anyone,” said Sita Khamcha of Phake, Ribdikot rural municipality. She hopes to earn Rs500,000 from round chillies.Last year, round chillies fetched Rs150 per kg but this year the minimum price has been set at Rs220 per kg. The floor price was set in coordination with Ribdikot rural municipality, said Sita. Farmers are getting Rs260 per kg.Farmers said the market is no problem for round chillies—both red and green varieties.

He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well.

Designed in 1651 by Gian Lorenzo Bernini for the then-Pope, Innocent X, the fountain depicts the major rivers of the four continents where papal authority had spread: the Nile, Danube, Rio de la Plata – and the Ganges.For the average Western tourist, it’s an impressive sight, a grand spectacle. For the average Indian, too, it is that, and perhaps too an evocation of pride: this is our river, our Ganga. (It’s a different matter that Bernini’s Ganga is a muscular and heavily bearded man, not at all the makara-riding goddess Indians know her as).But, inaccuracies and all, Bernini’s Ganga is an interesting reflection of just how vital this river is, how resoundingly a symbol of India. In Europe, which in 1651 still knew little of the exotic East, the Orient was exemplified by the Ganga; in India, it has been not just water, not just life, but much more. Mother, saviour, purifier, the very heartbeat of India, the core of Hinduism.It is this river that Siddharth Kapila sets out to trace in Tripping Down the Ganga: A Son’s Exploration of Faith (Speaking Tiger Books, 2024). The book brings together Kapila’s travels along the Ganga: more specifically, to seven spaces situated beside the river that are the focus of yaatras or pilgrimages for Hindus. As Kapila explains in his introduction to his memoir, these journeys took place in two different time periods: one, in the 7 years between 2015 and 2022; and another in earlier years, when Kapila went on yaatras along with his mother.These journeys intertwine through the book, the same spot – whether Kedarnath or Badrinath, Gangotri or Kashi – experienced at two different times. Kapila intersperses memories of less than a decade back with those of nearly 30 years ago, creating an interesting palimpsest of places, pilgrimages, people.The people are what shine through bright and clear here, because it is their faith that takes centre stage. Kapila’s conversations, both with those around him and with himself, grow increasingly insightful and deep as the book progresses.He talks to holy men who brave ice-water baths in Gangotri; to Naga sadhus, the warriors sworn to protect the faith; to the formidable (and unsettlingly ‘different’, for some people?) Aghoris, who haunt the cremation grounds at Kashi. He discusses spirituality both with Westerners journeying through India, as well as his partner, a young Aghan edging towards Buddhism.And, importantly, he dwells on the faith of his mother, a tax lawyer who is deeply devout and for whom her religion comes through as the fulcrum of her life. Many of the yaatras Kapila narrates are performed in his mother’s company, but there are other ways too in which she enters the narrative: in conversations, in her son’s views on organised religion and faith (often widely divergent from those of his mother’s), even in his discussion of the dichotomy that seemingly reveals itself in his mother. A hard-headed, clear-minded, utterly rational lawyer when she’s at work, but a believing, ritual-driven devotee when she’s not. The faith, in its many avatars, its many forms, shows up in diverse ways. For instance, the quiet devotion of the many people who give up their lives with family and home to turn sanyasi (and there are several of these in this book, including the Kapila family’s own Swamiji).But, in contrast to that quiet devotion, the boisterous and loud ‘masti married to bhakti’ which Kapila describes in context of the kaanwariyas who trek every season to the Ganga to draw water. Or, as he puts it, the ‘Great Indian Free-For-All’: pushing, shoving, loud, exuberant devotees, making no bones about their religious fervour.Tripping Down the Ganga, however, isn’t merely an exposition of the author’s own faith or the faith of those he encounters on his journeys; it is, too, a closer look at the religion, and at its intersection with other religions, other organised structures; at Hinduism’s fraught relationship with Buddhism and its even more fraught relationship with Islam; at the burgeoning (especially in recent times) of the connection between religion and politics, and the hidden realities of issues such as the Gyanvapi Masjid and the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor Project.Part travelogue, part memoir, part introspection, this book manages to bring together many aspects of the Ganga and all that surrounds its status as India’s most sacred river. Kapila’s writing is conversational, occasionally even humorous.He makes no pretence to erudition (though his research is obviously solid and extensive), and there’s a sincerity, a clear-sightedness that shines through. It does not, however, dull his faith, and one gets the impression that this is an individual whose faith is unswerving, but not at the cost of his humanity: he straddles two worlds, just as his mother seems to do. That subtitle ‘A Son’s Exploration of Faith’, turns out to be a worthy tribute to Kapila’s mother.Published in special arrangement with TheWire.in ","summary":"In the heart of Rome’s Piazza Navona stands one of the city’s most famous fountains: Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, the ‘Fountain of the Four Rivers’.

Kapila’s writing is conversational, occasionally even humorous.He makes no pretence to erudition (though his research is obviously solid and extensive), and there’s a sincerity, a clear-sightedness that shines through. It does not, however, dull his faith, and one gets the impression that this is an individual whose faith is unswerving, but not at the cost of his humanity: he straddles two worlds, just as his mother seems to do. That subtitle ‘A Son’s Exploration of Faith’, turns out to be a worthy tribute to Kapila’s mother.Published in special arrangement with TheWire.in "},{"hash":"9406bdcea9a2c9f287352663a078ba6ad7e076893fc5d61db23a4001de8e9a9f","title":"love-and-manipulation","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/books/2024/10/26/love-and-manipulation","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/Untitled8-1729908771.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1729900800000,"source":"kp","category":"books","content":"Many books are said to have the power to heal, but can a book trouble you? I didn’t realise it until I read Kate Elizabeth Russell’s ‘My Dark Vanessa’. This novel has deeply impacted me, breaking my heart. I even allowed it to rob me of peaceful sleep. It is devastatingly beautiful and worth every bit of the sorrow it left behind.Russell weaves themes of love, trauma, denial, grooming, and the long-term effects of abuse. I struggle to express how a story filled with pain and turmoil can be portrayed with such beauty. How does grooming blur the lines between love, control, and abuse? This is one of the novelvs most Intriguing questions. ‘My Dark Vanessa’ begins in 2017, introducing 30-year-old Vanessa Wye as she prepares to work at a hotel in Portland, Maine. The narrative opens with her refreshing her Facebook page. She is anxiously awaiting updates about Jacob Strane, who is her former English teacher and is under investigation for sexual assault by a former student.The story alternates between this timeline and Vanessa’s past, starting in 2000 when she is a 15-year-old scholarship student at a prestigious boarding school, Browick. In the same year, Vanessa’s relationship with her best friend had turned cold, and no one had filled the vacuum. Vanessa isn’t particularly close to her parents either. Her mother urges her to promise that she will make a large group of new friends so she won’t spend all day alone in her room. Vanessa’s mother is determined for her to “get out there” and live a fuller life this year.To cope with her loneliness and become more involved, Vanessa joins the creative writing club, where Jacob Strane is the faculty advisor. After learning that Vanessa has no friends, Jacob asks her personal questions. As their conversation continues, Jacob's behaviour makes Vanessa uneasy. These lines from the book reveal the beginning of something unsettling: “Mr Strane sets the eraser on the chalk rail and contemplates me from across the room. He slips his hands into his pockets and looks me up and down.”“That's a nice dress. I like your style.”A middle-aged teacher commenting on a student’s outfit feels uncomfortable. One day, in the classroom, Vanessa makes a mistake on the computer. Jacob reaches down, places his hand over hers, and guides the mouse. When she makes another mistake, he repeats the action but squeezes her hand this time. What’s disturbing is that Jacob doesn’t behave this way with other students. This marks the beginning of Jacob’s physical closeness to Vanessa.Gradually, Jacob starts asking to read Vanessa’s poems and writings. He praises her work, making her feel special—intoxicating, as she feels isolated and misunderstood at school. Jacob’s behaviour is a mix of charm and manipulation, which lays the groundwork for a grooming process where he preys on her vulnerabilities, convincing her that their bond is unique and meaningful. Over time, Vanessa enjoys his attention, secretly longing to be noticed.One day, while Jacob is still focused on her poem, his knee brushes against Vanessa’s bare thigh beneath her skirt’s hemline. Vanessa freezes. As he continues reading, he tells her she’s a dark romantic like him, someone drawn to dark things. Then, he pats her knee. She remains paralysed, unable to move, while he continues marking her poem, his other hand slowly stroking her knee. At that moment, Vanessa feels disconnected, as though she has changed and become something less than human.Vanessa feels detachment and disorientation as Jacob touches her. She is no longer grounded in her body, drifting away from her sense of self. The unsettling actions make her feel alienated and disconnected from her usual identity as a teenage student. She feels she has transformed into something unfamiliar and distant, leaving her unable to respond or react.Then, as days pass, Vanessa feels desperate for something more to happen between them. Little touches turn into kisses. Russell describes how Vanessa feels a sense of power to make a 42-year-old teacher fall at her feet. With a man 27 years older than her, Vanessa thinks that she has encountered love for the first time. Russell articulates Vanessa as fearless and bold for wanting something that can ruin her being. When Jacob invited her to his house, she readily agreed. Russell describes Vanessa in Jacob’s house, how she feels being there, what they do together, and what Jacob does to Vanessa. Although Vanessa perceives these encounters as consensual or romantic due to Jacob's grooming tactics, they are exploitative. Jacob positions himself as a lover while simultaneously reinforcing his dominance through emotional manipulation—he convinces her that she instigated their relationship and that their bond is special.Later, when Vanessa becomes more mature, a part of her believes that she was mistreated by Jacob, and another part wants those things more. When you are traumatised, when you are exposed to a negative feeling a lot, you start to get accustomed to it. You associate meaning with it. That is what Vanessa did: she associated abuse with love. The adult Vanessa struggles with her past, unable to form genuine connections with others. Now in her thirties, she finds disinterest in relationships with men her age. Instead, she focuses on Jacob, who occupies a central place in her thoughts.Despite the revelations of Strane's predatory behaviour towards other students, Vanessa clings to the belief that their relationship is special and consensual. This attachment is rooted in a complex mix of nostalgia and denial; she perceives Jacob as her first love, complicating her ability to move on. Vanessa often romanticises her past with Jacob, seeing it as a love story rather than confronting the manipulation and abuse she endured. This mindset drives her to fiercely defend him, even as she struggles with the truth of his actions. Her inner turmoil is captured in this powerful monologue:“I just really need it to be a love story. You know? I really, really need it to be that.” “Because if it isn’t a love story, then what is it?” “It’s my life. This has been my whole life.”These lines are loaded with emotional weight, and reading them brought me to tears. Russell captures Vanessa’s internal conflict perfectly—how she mistakes abuse for love and refuses to see herself as a victim.Jacob, unable to face the consequences after being exposed by his former students, is later found dead in a river, with suicide suspected. As Vanessa processes his death, she tries to piece together her life and heal.By the novel’s end, Vanessa adopts a dog and takes it for a walk. With the sun on her face and the dog beside her, Russell writes that Vanessa feels an immense capacity for good.

Congress is the largest party in the government led by KP Sharma Oli of the CPN-UML.Koirala, who contested for the post of party president and got defeated by Sher Bahadur Deuba three years ago, leads the anti-establishment faction in the party.Koirala has been raising critical questions against the government’s wrongdoings, causing apprehension among those in government. At times, he has even taken a stance against the government’s moves.For instance, Prime Minister Oli and Energy Minister Dipak Khadka are at loggerheads with Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) Managing Director Kul Man Ghising over whether or not to disrupt power supply to the companies defaulting in paying the NEA’s bills.In this prolonged dispute, Koirala has supported Ghising, who is backed by the main opposition, the CPN (Maoist Centre).Koirala was once a proponent of the Congress-UML coalition when Maoist Centre ditched the Congress to join hands with UML. He also played a role in forging an alliance with the UML to form a provincial government led by a Congress lawmaker in Koshi.Observers say that his latest stances are part of his strategy to present himself as a strong candidate for the party president in the next general convention, which should be held by the end of 2025 in accordance with the party statute.“It is possible that he is trying to establish himself as the main contender of the party leadership for the next convention, making the party rank and file believe that no other leaders can give alternatives to the party other than him,” Rajesh Gautam, a historian who has written multiple books on Congress, told the Post.As party president Sher Bahadur Deuba has already announced not to contest for the top post in the general convention, second-rung Congress leaders have already started making assumptions about the next leadership.Koirala, who lost to Deuba by a small margin for the party’s top post in 2021, is considered an untested leader because he hasn’t taken any key position in the party and has not even become a minister so far.Party leaders close to Koirala say that he was making comments based on the merit of the government’s performance.They say that by making such comments, Koirala has been trying to bring the government on the right track when it fumbles. Sometimes, he might seem harsh towards the government, but that is aimed at correcting the coalition and not toppling it, they argue.“Before Congress-UML came together to form the government, Koirala was one of the leaders who had advocated for the coalition of the two biggest parties,” Govindaraj Pokharel, a Congress leader close to Koirala, told the Post. “Therefore, as the proponent of the present coalition, he might have thought it was his moral duty to question the government if it cannot live up to its promise.”But Gautam differs.The performance of the government is below par and even the layman can find faults in its functioning, Gautam says.The Congress-UML government was formed in July based on a seven-point agreement, and its basic duty is to work to fulfill it. When the government deviates from its promised objectives to other issues, Pokharel says, Koirala sometimes becomes critical of the government to remind it of its objectives.In the recent party programme held on October 10, Koirala mentioned the three areas where the government had unnecessarily poked its nose: by not allowing the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) chief Kul Man Ghising to work as per his plan, by trying to unseat the Deputy Speaker Indira Magar Rana, and by planning to issue an ordinance related to Political Parties.Pokharel argues that Koirala has supported the government’s right move. When the government decided to constitute a high-level commission to recommend reforms to revitalise the ailing economy under the leadership of former finance secretary Rameshwar Khanal, Koirala welcomed it, Pokharel says.Apart from that, he adds, Koirala never criticised the government when it decided to take the tasks of the peace process ahead, pay the due amounts of sugarcane farmers, or form a committee to revitalise the country's tourism sector. However, the wrong act of the government should be questioned, and even though he is a leader from the coalition partner and he is not mincing words, Pokharel says.Jeevan Pariyar, a Congress joint general secretary, also says that Koirala's opinion on holding the government accountable should not be misinterpreted.“However, the government is still to fulfill its promises,” Pariyar told the Post.Two days ago, the government decided to provide free cancer treatment for children below 14 years of age at government hospitals. Pariyar describes it as a latest example of the positive initiatives taken by the government.Minister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel decided on Sunday to provide free cancer treatment for children below 14 years of age at Kanti Children’s Hospital, Bhaktapur Cancer Hospital and BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital Bharatpur.There is no point in getting disappointed by the government since it has only completed 100 days, Pariyar says.However, some Congress leaders think the government is not working as per their expectation.In Monday’s meeting of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives, Congress lawmaker Hirdayaram Thani raised several questions to Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, a Congress leader, about the home ministry’s performance.“Where has the investigation on the irregularities on Giri Bandhu tea estate reached?” Thani questioned Home Minister Lekhak. The Giri Bandhu land scam is linked to Prime Minister Oli and Congress, which officially made its position clear through its parliamentary party meeting on May 14 and demanded an investigation into the decision-making process of the land swap permit. Thani also asked the home minister why investigations on various other corruption scams weren’t moving ahead satisfactorily.Pokharel, the Congress leader, says questioning the government does not mean the Congress leader does not favour this coalition government.“The duty of leaders who are representing the party in the government is to do better work,” Pokharel says. “It is also the duty of leaders out of the government to question it to make it accountable to the people.” ","summary":"As the government completes 100 days in office, some leaders from its major coalition partner, the Nepali Congress, have started to comment on the government’s performance—often unfavourably.Remarks by some key Congress leaders, particularly by senior Congress leader Shekhar Koirala, have alarmed a section of the governing parties.

He to be honest with the people hereon.“Rest assured and run the government, don’t worry much about whether the Maoists will again come to power.”Observers, however, doubt Dahal’s claim as it has only been just over 100 days since the Maoist party was ousted from the government. They also say the party, while being in the government for most of the past decade or so, hasn’t achieved much.Moreover, whatever Dahal might say, there is no way to remove the government unless there is a tussle between the two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML.The observers thus see the Maoist Centre’s protest as an outcome of the Maoist leaders’ restlessness over being out of the government for some months. In the 275-strong House of Representatives that elects the prime minister, the biggest coalition partner, the Congress, has 88 seats while the prime minister’s UML party has 78 seats. Thus the two largest coalition partners alone command a comfortable majority. Some other fringe parties have also joined the government. Maoist Centre General Secretary Dev Gurung says Dahal addressed the issue after a meeting of the ruling parties on Friday concluded that efforts were on to topple the government.“Attempts to seek an alternative to the democratic system and government cannot be acceptable,” said the seven-point joint statement of the ruling parties. Gurung said that they just tried to clear the misconception. “Despite having a majority in the House, the way they are panicking about a possible government change is something unusual,” he said.Political experts said the only way to change the government at present is by proving a majority in the House.“The Maoists always get restless when they are not in the government, and it is no different now,” Mumaram Khanal, a political analyst, told the Post. “Today’s agitation is nothing but a means to show that the party’s relevance will remain intact until the next elections.”The Maoist Centre is a party that has been in power for most of the nine years since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015.But why did the party have to call for a protest no sooner than it had left the government? Maoist Centre General Secretary Gurung refused to answer the question. But when the same query was put before Agni Sapkota, vice-chair and spokesperson for the Maoist Centre, he accused the Oli government of failing on all fronts save for its initiative to push for the completion of the peace process. “That is one reason which compelled us to organise a meeting of this kind,” Sapkota said.After the formation of the UML-Congress coalition in mid-July, the ruling parties including the main opposition have amended the transitional justice related law.Similarly, the party leaders who spoke at the mass gathering on Saturday raised questions about the prime minister’s prolonged absence from the country even as Nepal was being ravaged by floods and landslides.Prime Minister Oli was in the United States to attend the United Nations General Assembly at the time. Some people then accused the prime minister of showing insensitivity after he refused to cut short his US trip. When the Post talked to some participants of Saturday’s mass gathering, they struggled to come up with a rationale for the protest programme. But a few of them did question the Oli government’s record on governance and the prime minister’s supposed protection of the corrupt people in the government even while cracking down on those from opposition parties. They also questioned the UML’s acceptance of a piece of expensive real estate from a controversial businessman. Min Bahadur Gurung, the owner of Bhatbhateni supermarket, on October 11 donated land to build the UML head office. Gurung is facing multiple corruption and fraud cases in court.“The Oli government has failed on multiple fronts and is working to protect the corrupt people,” one participant told the Post. “The previous government [led by Dahal] was toppled after it tried to prosecute corrupt politicians.”During his address, Dahal asked for answers from the government on the status of the investigation on the Bhutanese refugee scam, as well as on other alleged fraud cases such as the Bansbari land grab and Giribandhu Tea Estate scam. Dahal accused the government of protecting corrupt officials and sidestepping accountability measures. “This government appears to have been formed to shield—not expose—corruption,” he said.The Maoist chief also questioned why leaders from the UML and the Congress who have also been accused of misappropriating funds from various cooperatives, have faced no action. “Those named in the [parliamentary panel] report should be investigated and arrested if guilty,” he said, adding that selectively targeting opposition members for investigation is unjust.But political analyst Khanal doesn’t buy the argument. “Until today, which government has taken action against powerful people?” he questions. “What Dahal is saying is propaganda,” Khanal told the Post. While the Maoist Centre is accusing the government of not acting against some suspects in corruption scams, Khanal questioned why the suspects were not brought under the purview of the law while Dahal was the prime minister. ","summary":"CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, addressing a mass gathering organised by the party in Kathmandu, stressed two issues on Saturday—that his party wasn’t in a hurry to bring down the present government and that they took to the streets to expose the government’s bad governance.Dahal claimed his party is now focused on introspection, reviewing the party’s activities and connecting with the people.Addressing the gathering, which was also projected as a show of force by the main opposition party, Dahal claimed the top Maoist leadership has undpledgedertaken a serious review of the party’s activities and that they won’t engage in any manoeuvring to topple the present government.“Our party made a mistake by forging alliance with reactionary forces in the past but we now vow not to repeat that mistake,” Dahal said. He to be honest with the people hereon.“Rest assured and run the government, don’t worry much about whether the Maoists will again come to power.”Observers, however, doubt Dahal’s claim as it has only been just over 100 days since the Maoist party was ousted from the government. They also say the party, while being in the government for most of the past decade or so, hasn’t achieved much.Moreover, whatever Dahal might say, there is no way to remove the government unless there is a tussle between the two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML.The observers thus see the Maoist Centre’s protest as an outcome of the Maoist leaders’ restlessness over being out of the government for some months. In the 275-strong House of Representatives that elects the prime minister, the biggest coalition partner, the Congress, has 88 seats while the prime minister’s UML party has 78 seats. Thus the two largest coalition partners alone command a comfortable majority. Some other fringe parties have also joined the government. Maoist Centre General Secretary Dev Gurung says Dahal addressed the issue after a meeting of the ruling parties on Friday concluded that efforts were on to topple the government.“Attempts to seek an alternative to the democratic system and government cannot be acceptable,” said the seven-point joint statement of the ruling parties. Gurung said that they just tried to clear the misconception. “Despite having a majority in the House, the way they are panicking about a possible government change is something unusual,” he said.Political experts said the only way to change the government at present is by proving a majority in the House.“The Maoists always get restless when they are not in the government, and it is no different now,” Mumaram Khanal, a political analyst, told the Post. “Today’s agitation is nothing but a means to show that the party’s relevance will remain intact until the next elections.”The Maoist Centre is a party that has been in power for most of the nine years since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015.But why did the party have to call for a protest no sooner than it had left the government? Maoist Centre General Secretary Gurung refused to answer the question. But when the same query was put before Agni Sapkota, vice-chair and spokesperson for the Maoist Centre, he accused the Oli government of failing on all fronts save for its initiative to push for the completion of the peace process. “That is one reason which compelled us to organise a meeting of this kind,” Sapkota said.After the formation of the UML-Congress coalition in mid-July, the ruling parties including the main opposition have amended the transitional justice related law.Similarly, the party leaders who spoke at the mass gathering on Saturday raised questions about the prime minister’s prolonged absence from the country even as Nepal was being ravaged by floods and landslides.Prime Minister Oli was in the United States to attend the United Nations General Assembly at the time. Some people then accused the prime minister of showing insensitivity after he refused to cut short his US trip. When the Post talked to some participants of Saturday’s mass gathering, they struggled to come up with a rationale for the protest programme. But a few of them did question the Oli government’s record on governance and the prime minister’s supposed protection of the corrupt people in the government even while cracking down on those from opposition parties. They also questioned the UML’s acceptance of a piece of expensive real estate from a controversial businessman. Min Bahadur Gurung, the owner of Bhatbhateni supermarket, on October 11 donated land to build the UML head office. Gurung is facing multiple corruption and fraud cases in court.“The Oli government has failed on multiple fronts and is working to protect the corrupt people,” one participant told the Post. “The previous government [led by Dahal] was toppled after it tried to prosecute corrupt politicians.”During his address, Dahal asked for answers from the government on the status of the investigation on the Bhutanese refugee scam, as well as on other alleged fraud cases such as the Bansbari land grab and Giribandhu Tea Estate scam.

While presenting his accomplishments, Oli committed to take action against cooperatives frauds and to refund the money of depositors.As the prime minister claimed that the government was making progress in terms of creating the environment for returning the savings of cooperatives depositors, the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperative Depositors has announced the fourth phase of protest, accusing the authorities of not implementing the agreements reached with them in the past.Alleging the government’s non-commitment to implementing its earlier promises made with the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperative Depositors, leaders of the campaign on Thursday organised a press meet in Kathmandu on Thursday where they announced to start the fourth phase of protests from November 20.They said they would still wait for the government to implement the agreements until the deadline. The representatives of the victims claimed that the fourth phase of the protest would be a decisive one.“Despite reaching an eight-point agreement one-and-a-half months ago, the government has not cared to address the problem since. Therefore, we planned to resume our protest,” Kusluv KC, chair of the campaign, told the Post.“Minister for land management, cooperatives, and poverty alleviation [Balaram Adhikari]’s claim at a press conference on Wednesday that they addressed our concerns made us furious.”The government had reached an eight-point agreement with the cooperatives victims on September 9. It was the third agreement signed between the government and the depositors who lost their savings within a year.“Not only are cooperatives frauds being prosecuted, but initiatives are also being taken to formulate a cooperatives authority act, and establish a cooperatives credit information centre and debt recovery tribunal that are necessary to refund depositors’ money,\" Prime Minister Oli said, while presenting the government's progress in its 100 days in office on Wednesday.Cooperatives victims resumed their third phase of protests on June 24, accusing the government of failing to implement agreements signed with two ministers in the past.The victims staged the first phase of their agitation in June last year. They reached a seven-point agreement with Ranjita Shrestha, then-minister for land management, cooperatives, and poverty alleviation.As the agreement was not implemented, they launched the second phase of agitation. On March 22 this year, they signed an eight-point agreement with Minister Adhikari.The victims suspended their 108-day protest following the eight-point agreement of September 9 as the government reiterated its promise to return their savings. The eight points were agreed upon after a negotiation between the representatives of the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperative Depositors and government officials in the presence of Arjun Prasad Pokharel, the secretary at the ministry.As per the agreement, a committee was formed with the sub-registrar of the Cooperatives Department as coordinator. Its mandate was to continuously assist in collecting and analysing data to address issues, including the return of depositors’ savings. The committee comprises representatives from the ministry and the national campaign. The campaign chair, Kushluv KC, said Singh KC, a Kuleshwar-based Gautam Shree Cooperative victim, agreed to represent them on the committee. “The committee agreed to monitor the inspection of crisis-ridden cooperatives, collect all the details, and categorise cooperatives,” Kushluv KC told the Post. “The committee was supposed to present its findings and recommendations to the department after analysing the collected data.”But one and a half months after the third-phase agreement, government agencies did not seem positive about holding the meeting as agreed to solve the problem, KC blamed.The committee agreed to conduct financial analysis of the inspected cooperatives, categorise them as well-functioning, crisis-oriented, and crisis-ridden, and recommend necessary actions. It was also agreed that a review meeting would be held at the Ministry of Land Management on the last Sunday of every month to assess the committee’s progress. However, the cooperatives victims say no point of the agreement was implemented.Similarly, the agreement reaffirmed the government's commitment to implementing the previous agreements made with cooperatives victims.“The victims might have thought that the execution of the agreement means immediate receipt of money, which has not happened,” Tola Raj Upadhyaya, deputy registrar and information officer at the Department of Cooperatives, said. “But the government is seriously working to implement the agreement.”In a separate announcement, the government had announced to return the money of small depositors in troubled cooperatives during the budget presentation. It has, however, defaulted on this pledge as well.During the budget presentation for the fiscal year 2024-25 on May 28, the government announced a plan to refund the savings of these small depositors.“To solve the problem in the savings and credit cooperatives, arrangements will be made to return depositers’ money up to Rs500,000 by using the property of cooperatives operators or of their immediate kin as collateral,” then-finance minister Barsha Man Pun said in his budget speech in Parliament.The Post talked to the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation officials shortly after the budget presentation for clarification on how the refund plan would go ahead.At the time, ministry officials had said the government policy, already endorsed by Parliament, would take effect from the start of the new fiscal year. However, five months into the new fiscal year, the government is still busy drafting guidelines to carry out the refund.“Apart from drafting guidelines, we also are waiting for the real data on the cooperatives victims; we are yet to receive the data from the provincial and local governments,” Upadhyaya told the Post. “Once the data is obtained, the money of the victims will be returned by selling the property of the people who misappropriated cooperatives funds.” ","summary":"Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli presented his government’s 100-day report on Wednesday.

The law allows a custody of up to 90 days for investigation into money laundering charges.Earlier, on October 18, the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police apprehended Lamichhane from Kathmandu after the Kaski District Court issued an arrest warrant against him.Judge Chandrakanta Paudel’s bench on Thursday authorised extension of their detention, including that of Pachhai, who was arrested in connection with the same case. The District Police Office and Office of the District’s Attorney submitted separate reports to the court on Thursday seeking a 25-day custody remand for the investigation into cooperative fraud, organised crime and money laundering charges.Deputy Superintendent of Police Basanta Kumar Sharma, who is also the spokesperson of the District Police Office in Kaski, said that police would investigate Lamichhane, Joshi and Pachhai on money laundering charges. “Investigation on three different charges will be carried out against them,” said Sharma.On Thursday, district attorney Kamala Kafle, along with assistant district attorneys Shantidevi Sharma and Bipinraj Tiwari, argued that an additional 25-day custody period was necessary to complete the investigation. Lawyers Yubaraj Parajuli and Bed Bahadur Bista supported this request, stating that crucial documents from various government offices, institutions, and banks were yet to be obtained, and further interrogation remains pending.Senior advocates Narayan Ghimire and Hari Prasad Subedi, representing Lamichhane, advocated against the extension of the detention, as did lawmaker and advocate Sobita Gautam, and other advocates Narayan Kandel, Padmaraj Sharma, and Madhukumar Chaulagain. Advocate Jagannath Dhakal defended Joshi during the hearing.During the court session, Lamichhane, initially agitated, claimed that he had repeatedly been subjected to examinations and that the charges against him were politically motivated.

This happened before he joined politics in June 2022.After receiving the report, Speaker Devraj Ghimire of the House of Representatives a month ago directed the government to implement the report’s recommendations and a Cabinet meeting instructed the state agencies concerned to take necessary action as per the probe committee’s recommendations.Meanwhile, RSP leaders and activists intensified their protest after the court extended Lamichhane’s custody remand for seven more days. The protesters defied prohibitory orders imposed by the Kaski administration.The protesters and security personnel clashed after the former entered the prohibited area. The RSP supporters who staged demonstrations at Wai Chowk entered the prohibitory area and marched towards Sahid Chowk through Rastrabank Chowk.The demonstrators chanted slogans against the KP Sharma Oli-led government accusing it of taking political revenge against the RSP Chairman Lamichhane.

Joshi was brought to Rupandehi a few days ago, where they spent 13 hours recording his statement before he was sent back to Kaski.According to a police source, preparations are on to bring Lamichhane to Rupandehi on Friday for testimony.A total of Rs780 million deposited in Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative by 10,391 depositors was embezzled, according to reports. An investigation revealed that Rs142.9 million from Supreme’ funds was transferred to the Gorkha Media Network's bank account. Police earlier filed a case against 28 people including Rai, Joshi and Om Prakash Gurung. The Rupandehi District Court sent Gurung, the chairman of the Butwal-based Supreme Saving and Credit Co-operative, to jail for judicial custody on charges of misusing cooperative funds.Gurung, who has been accused of embezzling Rs1.078 billion of savings deposited by over 10,000 members at the Rai-led cooperative, was sent to jail by judge Shriprakash Upreti.

The court also granted permission to police to arrest nine others who were allegedly involved in embezzling funds of Butwal-based Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative.The single bench of judge Shyam Prasad Shrestha issued the permission to arrest them. Lamichhane and Joshi are in police custody in Kaski while Rai is on the run. Joshi was brought to Rupandehi a few days ago, where they spent 13 hours recording his statement before he was sent back to Kaski.According to a police source, preparations are on to bring Lamichhane to Rupandehi on Friday for testimony.A total of Rs780 million deposited in Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative by 10,391 depositors was embezzled, according to reports. An investigation revealed that Rs142.9 million from Supreme’ funds was transferred to the Gorkha Media Network's bank account. Police earlier filed a case against 28 people including Rai, Joshi and Om Prakash Gurung. The Rupandehi District Court sent Gurung, the chairman of the Butwal-based Supreme Saving and Credit Co-operative, to jail for judicial custody on charges of misusing cooperative funds.Gurung, who has been accused of embezzling Rs1.078 billion of savings deposited by over 10,000 members at the Rai-led cooperative, was sent to jail by judge Shriprakash Upreti. However, the court released six others, including Dipesh Pun, the son of former Vice President Nanda Bahadur Pun, who were also accused of embezzling cooperatives cash.

Before the Covid-19 pandemic started in Nepal, it was Rs75,000 per tola.Shakya said that the interesting thing happening globally is that central banks, apart from the investors, buy gold nowadays.According to a Financial Times analysis, consistent foreign central bank purchases have been an important driver of gold’s strength. Such buying seems not just related to the desire of many to gradually diversify their reserve holdings away from significant dollar dominance despite America’s “economic exceptionalism”, according to the analyst.

There is no upper limit for holding physical gold (such as jewellery, coins, bars, etc.), but the Income Tax Act specifies certain limits. The Income Tax Department’s guidelines outline permissible limits for possessing gold for individuals based on marital status. A married woman may hold up to 500 grams of gold, while the limit for unmarried women is 250 grams. For men, the threshold is 100 grams.

USSD is a session-based, real-time messaging communication technology accessed through a string, usually starting with an asterisk (*) and ending with a hash (#), for instance *500#.According to Nepal’s central bank study report on the USSD-based payment system and its regulations, USSD technology is considered a cost-effective, faster, and handset-agnostic mode of payment due to its short turnaround time and data privacy.The report said that in Nepal, 50 percent of adults from rural areas and 40 percent of adults from urban areas still lack an account at a financial institution.USSD-based payment allows merchant payments and accessible credit facilities to people, especially in rural and marginalised settings.USSD offers access to digital financial services in areas where telecom network connectivity is poor for voice telephony or where there is no or poor internet connectivity. To use the service, you do not require a smartphone.The report said that the feature phone ownership rate in Nepal is higher than that of smartphones in rural municipalities and provinces.Madhesh Province has 12.97 percent feature phone penetration and 11.60 percent smartphone penetration. In Karnali Province, there is 4.51 percent feature phone penetration and 3.21 percent smartphone penetration.Similarly, Sudurpaschim Province has 6.84 percent feature phone penetration and 5.42 percent smartphone penetration.The report said this provides opportunities to increase financial inclusion by targeting feature phone users in rural municipalities and select provinces with a USSD-based payment system.The expert says that if mobile operators start a USSD-based payment system, it will definitely aid in financial inclusion and make daily transactions easy with just a text message.Most rural and even urban populations are not used to app-based payment services, and a USSD-based payment system will allow those populations to make transactions quickly and conveniently. According to the report, small and medium entrepreneurs in rural areas benefit from it by taking credit and making payments.Sanjib Subba, a fintech expert, said that the USSD-based payment needs to be implemented effectively as many people still use feature mobile phones, so there is a connectivity issue for financial inclusivity.“In a country like Nepal, where internal migration is huge, USSD payments can be made easily by sending money person-to-person (P2P) and person-to-merchant (P2M),” said Subba.He added that a USSD-based payment system needs to be pushed.Telcos are the primary carriers and telecom service providers like Nepal Telecom and Ncell, which help bring financial inclusivity to the last mile through the USSD. Experts said the cost of moving money through a USSD-based payment system needs to be minimal or even zero. In 2009, Hello Paisa, in partnership with Laxmi Bank, introduced a USSD-based payment system in Nepal. Nepal started using a USSD-based payment system for mobile financial services in 2021. In March 2021, the central bank issued the payment service provider license to Nepal Digital Payments Company (NDPC) Limited to implement USSD-based mobile financial services.NDPC was established with a key stake in Nepal Telecom and Rastriya Banijya Bank Limited. In September 2021, NDPC launched the NamastePay *500# USSD service for its NamastePay wallet, which has basic features such as user registration, mobile top-up, and P2P transfer.However, the uptrend in app-based financial systems like eSewa wallet (commenced in 2010), mobile banking applications (initiated in 2012), Inter-bank payment system (IPS, launched in 2016), connectIPS (launched in 2018), and others began well before 2021, offering offer sophisticated user experience valued by customers, the adoption of USSD channel, which has its underlying limitations, was constrained.According to the study report, first, customers extensively use app-based systems with intuitive user experience; USSD may not be quickly adopted as the primary payment channel. This is evident from the lower adoption of NDPC’s USSD-based mobile financial system. However, according to the study, the USSD channel can be an alternative when app-based online payment systems cannot be accessed.Second, it can be costly for the customer and the financial service provider. If the session dropout rates are not controlled, customers may be liable for higher transaction fees. For financial service providers, adding USSD as a channel by bearing the capital expenditure and operational costs may not be justifiable, as people have already adopted innovative app-based payment systems, the report said.Third, as USSD menus are generally complex to navigate, it is challenging to create appropriate user awareness considering customers' geography, administrative construct, and literacy level.The report said that USSD could benefit customers as an alternative to existing payment systems by providing easy mobile phone top-up or recharge service using the USSD channel when the customer runs out of balance and lacks internet connectivity.It enables elderly people and others who are accustomed to feature phones to access government-to-person (G2P) payments (such as pensions and other government transfers) through the USSD channel.The report recommends that the telecommunication authority mandate all mobile network operators to provide USSD for mobile financial services. To ensure a uniform customer experience, the authority should explore the possibility of mandating all mobile network operators to implement a common USSD code for mobile financial services.

Normally, the Kalimati market handles 700-800 tonnes of vegetables daily.However, the demand increases amid short supplies during the festivities, and prices go up, said Shrestha.Of the 500 tonnes of vegetables that arrive at the Kalimati market, 40 percent are potatoes and onions. Green vegetables make up the rest.Traders said that the prices might slowly cool after Tihar and Chhath festivals, with more consignments coming from farms.Consumer rights activists said that leaving the vegetable market unchecked has caused the prices to reach uncontrollably high.Vegetable prices have increased by more than 300 percent within a month, and this is not only because of the low output, said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum. “The government is either unaware of the issue, or it is simply giving traders a free hand.”“It is the government's responsibility to monitor the supply situation and push down prices during the festivals and a crisis.”Changing weather patterns have significantly impacted vegetable production.

They claimed that while infection rates have increased of late, the number of severe cases and deaths has not increased proportionately. But experts say the situation is far worse than what the authorities admit.The rise in infection rate has not only overwhelmed general hospitals of the Kathmandu Valley, but also caused an acute blood crisis, increased premature birth, low birth weight, and a shortage of paracetamol in pharmacies. “Many patients suffering from dengue shock syndrome, hemorrhagic fever, pneumonia, diarrhoea, and multi-organ failure due to severe dengue have been admitted to our hospital,” said Dr Niraj Bam, an associate professor at the Institute of Medicine, TUTH. “Agencies responsible must take measures immediately to break the chain of the infection and prevent an exponential rise in new cases.”Public health experts blame the apathy of health agencies and government for the exponential rise in cases. They say neither the concerned health agencies nor the government are taking the situation seriously.“Previously, we used to carry out search and destroy drives frequently to destroy mosquito breeding sites, launch awareness drives, and request security agencies for blood donations to manage the dengue epidemic,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, former director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “But now, no measures are being taken to control the spread of the virus. None of the agencies has considered dengue as a public health emergency.”Experts said more concerning is the fact that the authorities have been attempting to conceal the infection and death rates to avoid criticism, and this is worsening the impact on the general public. “Hundreds of people wait for hours every day for blood at blood banks for their seriously ailing relatives admitted at various hospitals in Kathmandu Valley,” said Sandesh Thapa, a public relations officer at the Central Blood Transfusion Service (blood bank). “But the collection is too low. Even organisations in districts outside the Valley are unable to organise blood donation camps.”Officials at the blood bank said daily demand is around 400 pints, mostly from dengue patients, while donations are only around 30 to 40 pints.“Since the morning, I have received around 40 calls from organisations that previously organised blood donation camps, asking for blood for their former donors,” said Thapa. “But blood can’t be manufactured or bought, and the rise in dengue cases along with the festive season has reduced donations.”Blood bank officials have been asking the relatives of patients to find donors on their own and to post donation requests on social media.Public health experts warn of dire consequences if the seriousness of the dengue outbreak continues to be undermined. They say that the rise in premature births, low birth weights of newborns, and complications in pregnancy will lead to maternal and child mortality rates and jeopardise the achievements made from years of investments and endeavours. “A lot of people have been hospitalised, and hundreds more have been infected. Their experiences are harrowing,” said Dr Ghanshyam Gurung, executive director at the TUTH. “Authorities should not wait for the temperature to drop and the infection rate to decline naturally.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.So far, only 11 people have died, and over 22,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often concealed the actual number of deaths and infections.As there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms, including platelet-rich plasma transfusion.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives.Meanwhile, in view of the rising dengue cases, a meeting of the Council of Ministers on Thursday has decided to conduct a 10-minute cleanup campaign in all government offices at 10 am on Friday to remove mosquito breeding sites. The decision was made on the recommendation of the Ministry of Health. Officials said staffers will look for stagnant water in puddles, discarded tyres and bottles, among other things, during the campaign.  ","summary":"A 60-year-old man from ward 7 of Bidur Municipality in Nuwakot district, succumbed to dengue on Wednesday night.The man was first rushed to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH) on Monday night as his condition deteriorated, and later to a private hospital for intensive care due to a lack of vacant intensive care unit beds at the TUTH.Doctors attending the victim suffered from severe dengue, which led to shock, internal bleeding and multiorgan failure.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population, however, claimed that dengue was not the direct cause of death, as the victim also had high blood pressure. They claimed that while infection rates have increased of late, the number of severe cases and deaths has not increased proportionately.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

","summary":"Celeus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley "},{"hash":"c077b34beda2250a997231f215f178053a057340c5c72de0aec15b25ae40ddb7","title":"old-memories-and-new-realities-in-phidim","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/travel/2023/11/18/old-memories-and-new-realities-in-phidim","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2023/third-party/phidim%20main%20(1).JPG&w=900&height=601","date":1700265600000,"source":"kp","category":"travel","content":"Once again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood.

The Rs 8.3-billion increase brings the total to Rs99.7 billion. In the prior month (mid-July to mid-August), these loans grew by Rs1.3 billion. At the end of the last fiscal year through mid-July this year, they stood at Rs90.1 billion. Banks are wallowing in excess liquidity, and interest rates are meaningfully lower from just a few months ago. More importantly, the latest surge in margin loans follows an expansionary policy adopted by the monetary policy for the fiscal year 2024-25, which, among others, scrapped the Rs200-million margin-loan cap for institutional investors. The Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank, tightened the margin-loan policy three years ago when the 2021-22 monetary policy limited margin loan per customer to Rs40 million at one bank and Rs120 million at multiple banks. Investor speculation was rampant back then. The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE), the only stock exchange in the country, rallied from 1,099 in March 2019 to 3,227 in August 2021, before tumbling 44 percent to 1,807 by June 2022. Fast forward to now, and the NEPSE closed at 2,568 on July 25, the session before the latest monetary policy was announced. By August 18, it hit 3,048 and reversed lower, touching 2,443 on September 29. The index closed at 2,618 on Sunday.Bishnu Poudel, the current Finance Minister, has an enviable reputation for stock-market performance during his prior three stints, with the NEPSE up 69 percent between November 4, 2015 and August 1, 2016, up 82 percent between October 13, 2020 and July 12, 2021 and up 8 percent between December 22, 2022 and February 27, 2023. It seems he earnestly wants this unbroken streak to continue as his legacy. Poudel began his fourth stint as finance minister on July 15; a day ago, the NEPSE closed at 2,258. On September 18, he showed up unannounced at NEPSE headquarters, apparently seeking answers for the drop in the index from north of 3,000 to north of 2,500 within a month!Yes to long-term focus; no to gimmicksIf this conduct by a finance minister looks like cheap populism, it is exactly that. First, the NEPSE management wields no control over the direction of the index. It is instead dictated by the buy and sell orders of bullish and bearish investors/traders, who, for the most part, are, and should be, driven by the economy’s prospects, thereby company earnings—or a lack thereof. Second, news of Poudel’s appointment as finance minister had raised investor hopes that there would be prompt improvement on the regulatory front, including the appointment of chairman of the Securities Board of Nepal, which regulates the securities market in Nepal; the post has remained vacant since January this year. If Poudel’s visit to the NEPSE trading floor was a ploy to message the embittered investors that he is on the case and has their back, this can only be considered immature. A finance minister cannot be this preoccupied with an equity index, which has its own rhythms and tends to move in cycles—near- to, medium- to long-term. It is not rocket science, but securities—be it fixed income, currency, equities, or what have you—do not always go up. They cannot possibly. Poudel is a politician. Politicians—most anyway—have their eyes on the next election cycle. Hence they miss no opportunity to please voters, but it is responsible to follow the proper do’s and don’ts. As finance minister, Poudel will do himself a big favour if he focuses more on the long term and less on gimmicks. This is what will ensure him an enduring legacy. The NEPSE, having opened for trading in January 1994, is relatively young. Its market cap has gone from millions to trillions in three decades, yet it lacks even the most basic investing tools. Forget derivatives such as options and futures, which are not traded there, it is still not possible to short a NEPSE-listed stock. In shorting, borrowed shares are sold, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price. This involves an entirely different skill set and should lead to a balanced market, as in any given asset sometimes bulls are right, sometimes shorts.Stocks go up, and they go down It is unhealthy to only wish for upward bias. Unfortunately for Nepal’s stock market, that is the case, as, for instance, bears are denied an opportunity to butt heads with bulls. The problem gets exacerbated when regulators and concerned authorities such as Poudel routinely telegraph that they want higher prices, as was evident in his visit to the NEPSE headquarters. The recent change in margin-loan policy probably falls into the same bucket; the idea was to induce risk-on behaviour, and that happened. Here is the irony. The NEPSE jumped 34 percent from mid-July to mid-August and fell 14 percent the next month, even as borrowing took off. Those using leverage to go long are left holding the bag. Tweaking policy with a desire to push prices up may yield results in the short term, but this hardly helps if the aim is to graduate from an emerging to developed market someday. The sad truth is that when markets are under pressure, the human tendency to play the blame game holds true in all markets. The US banned short selling of financial stocks in September 2008 when they were in freefall, but they kept falling. A similar thing happened in several European countries in August 2011. For two years now, Chinese authorities have rolled out measures designed to breathe new life into real estate and stocks, but the Shanghai Composite Index continues to trade materially lower from its prior highs.Except for shorts, not a soul complains when an asset bubble is forming. But when markets are in crisis, they all get panicky, at times leading to absurd courses of action by the authorities. Developed markets can get away with this because they have gotten the scale—a go-to place for global investors. Emerging markets like Nepal are different. Here, as tempting as it is to wish for ever higher prices myopically, the solution does not lie there but rather in measures to lay the proper foundation, which, among others, is made up of as many tools as possible so that both bulls and bears get efficient. In the end, the more efficient the market, the less the need for government policy handouts.

They have been expressing their grief and thoughts about him. Personally, the news deeply shook me. Mishra was my English literature student at Patan college nearly half a century ago, shortly after I joined teaching. He was a talented young man, who had already begun working in some ways in the domain opened up by tourism in Nepal. He was a friend who shared his fresh visions about tourism, ecology and the humanism associated with that. Always bright, creative and vigilant, Mishra kept up his great spirit by working as a promoter and pioneer of some important ways of promoting tourism in Nepal.Those involved in the tourism sector recognised his genius because he widened the horizons of modern tourism. Mishra established links with the new modalities that prevailed outside. Moreover, he introduced new ways of establishing tourism as a serious and creative profession for the younger generation, who wanted to bring in more tourists and open up the possibility of introducing Nepal's exotic physical and cultural features.When Mishra joined this field, Nepal was bracing for a revolution in modern tourism that called for new talents and fresh initiatives to enter this profession. Such initiatives would embody the history of the changing modes of Nepali tourism. Mishra grew up in a culture that perceived tourism as part of a consciousness that developed in modern Nepal. A combination of human and pragmatic qualities shaped Nepali's perception of tourism. Young people were becoming interested in the creative dimensions of tourism unfolding in Asia, carrying both excitement and challenges. He represented that generation and worked with the crop of new entrants. The reason for Mishra’s continuum both as an innovator and activist was that he combined vision with activism. It is common to share some Shangri-La imaginaire about Nepal. The narratives about Nepal having the three highest Himalayan peaks and other stories about flora, fauna and culture deeply reflect that psyche. One thing that rightly strikes us is the subject of displaying Nepal's exotic, exquisite and unique features to those who visit this land to see them. You become meaningful only when others come and see those unique features of your land, culture and people. These people would be variously named as foreigners, visitors and lovers of the exotic features of Nepal. It became so entrenched in our psyche that we began to accentuate the selfsame features of Nepal in our projections and stories. But who showed those features to whom and who owned them up has an interesting and important history of its own. Broadly, two types of people appeared to foster a tourism culture in Nepal. Those who constituted the first type were people whose focus was on hunting animals. I have written an article on this aspect of tourism under the rubric No tiger for breakfast (January 4, 2024, The Kathmandu Post). Some of the early publications harp on this archetypal theme that shows hunting as the most dominant metaphor for the exotic feature of Nepali land teeming with beautiful wild animals. We find the first reference to that in Jung Bahadur's diary of 1875, titled Battis salko rojanamcha. The other important text is Michel Peissel's Tiger For Breakfast: The Story of Boris of Kathmandu, published on different dates, the latest being 2019. To cite from the text, \"The hero of this book is Boris Lissanevitch, ‘the famous ballet dancer and night-club king who goes hunting with film stars and maharajas.’\" All this had begun by 1960. A few metaphors like this and The Royal Hotel constituted the lingo of early tourism in Nepal. It sounds strange when we find that hunting, the popular metaphor of adventure, then should be the genesis of tourism in Nepal that had its origin in British colonial rule. The Rana rulers of Nepal were cleverly playing with this psyche of the British rulers and their representatives in India. When young people interested in culture, poetry and arts got involved in tourism, they totally changed the focus of exoticism in the field. They knew what was there in store for the visitors to see. The lofty heights, the exotic flora and fauna of this land, people, festivals and cultural monuments were waiting for them. Mishra represented this generation. They operated with a double bind shaped by a need to open up what was there and to take the visitors to the approachable spots. Trekking and visiting the sites were part of that. His role was that of what the press said: Tourism entrepreneur. Other appellations included his role in establishing the Nepal Tourism Board, promoting Nepali tourism worldwide through various activities and holding different positions in tourism organisational structures. Mishra had the ability and imagination to work in the transitional times. Many talented tourism entrepreneurs of the young generation emerged during this period. Mishra worked with different generations of these entrepreneurs and aspirants. He shared his experience of working with diverse groups of people engaged in this field. It is established that tourism culture combines both utopic and pragmatic visions. In his book The Imperial Archive (1993), Thomas Richards says an important segment of the tourists came to Nepal in search of a surrogate Shangri-La after it was believed to have been lost. Nepal needed a creative generation of tourism operators who could understand this psyche. Some of these entrepreneurs emerged in Nepal. Many talented tourism operators and promoters are working in this field today. However, understanding this psyche and creating conditions for tourism operations was challenging, especially during the late sixties and seventies in Nepal. I witnessed that period closely and befriended foreign poets, writers and artists known as hippies. But tourism as we know it today seriously began after that period. And that continues to constitute the shape of tourism in Nepal. Tourism entrepreneurs and operators now believe that they have found the language and modus operandi to advance it further. They, including Mishra, worked in hard times like the 2015 earthquakes and Covid-19. His death is a significant loss to Nepali tourism. I pay tribute to this wonderful human being, Basanta Mishra, a pioneer, my student and a friend!      ","summary":"Tourism pioneer Basanta Mishra's passing leaves a void in Nepal's tourism industry, having revolutionized its landscape, fostered new approaches to showcasing Nepal's exotic beauty, and championed its growth as a professional field."},{"hash":"da881451733ee84683a911b4d8bdae4d8a69d34691188e81301286cd5a3a3e37","title":"tackle-it-now","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/10/25/tackle-it-now","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/thumb-1729796647.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1729814400000,"source":"kp","category":"editorial","content":"The gloomy days are upon us again. No sooner had the devastating monsoon rains left Nepali skies than the dry weather started. Those who had gone to their homes to celebrate the biggest festival, Dashain, have returned to cities, as have vehicles, contributing to the rising carbon monoxide levels. Farmers who have finished their seasonal harvest have piled up stubble on their farms to be burned openly. In a matter of days, thick haze and smoke coming from vehicles and farms will blanket the country, including the capital, Kathmandu, which has seen a worsening air quality in recent years. But the problem is by no means limited to Kathmandu.Stubble burning presents a bigger problem than imagined. In Nepal’s Tarai belt, burning harvest residues has become common and has only increased in recent years. A report from 2020, “A model-ready emission inventory for crop residue open burning in the context of Nepal,” shows how farmers’ increasing use of modern agricultural machines like combine harvesters contributes to increasing emissions. These machines save farmers’ time but leave plenty of residue behind. The general public and farmers are yet to internalise how their negligence is contributing to air pollution in the country, endangering lives, including their own. This has affected the vulnerable elderly and children the most; people of other ages are also facing health issues like pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems. Every year, particulate matter pollution takes the lives of 40,000 people in Nepal. Yet the public and government continue to pay scant attention to the issue. Smog also drifts to our part of the sky from India, the southern neighbour. Stubble burning is rampant in the country’s breadbasket states of Punjab and Haryana. This year alone, 22 stubble-burning complaints have been made to the police in Haryana, as per Reuters. No matter how hard these states have tried to put a lid on the problem by arresting farmers responsible for poor air, Delhi’s air is already becoming dangerous. Kathmandu’s air quality index will likely deteriorate if instances of stubble burning increase both at home and in India. Already on Wednesday, Chitwan, a city around 170 km southwest of Kathmandu, fared even worse than the national capital, with an AQI of 150.To address this crisis, farmers should be encouraged and sensitised to use climate-smart technologies, including modified combine harvesters and reaper harvesters, and taught about alternative uses of residues, like feeding them to animals, livestock rearing, and making biodegradable waste. Lighting them up should be the last resort. If these methods don’t work, the government can also punish repeat offenders through strict legal action. Cross-border climate diplomacy also needs to be ramped up—this has really become indispensable as climate change respects no borders. With the impending danger of air pollution, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, in collaboration with other federal stakeholders, has geared up to mitigate the problem this year through smoke metres, which detect vehicle emissions. But this is not enough. Again, the country should be able to control open burning and punish those involved in it. For this, the federal government must come up with a long-term plan. Other local units, particularly those with rampant stubble burning, must also step up to the plate. The problem is air pollution is too serious and too urgent to put off for another day.  ","summary":"The gloomy days are upon us again.

In the digital landscape, children are regularly exposed to things that aren’t accessible in real life. While children are more tech-savvy than ever, there is a glaring lack of awareness on the potential dangers of the virtual world. According to a report by The Guardian, each year, more than 300 million children worldwide become victims of online sexual exploitation and abuse. In Nepal, in under two months of the fiscal year 2024-2025, the Cyber Bureau recorded 68 cybercrime cases involving children. It logged 635 cases in the previous fiscal year, 2023-24—a 260.8 percent rise from the 176 cases in the fiscal year 2022-23. This is concerning for a nation where per capita internet usage is greater than in some developed nations even as its digital literacy rates are low. Many Nepali parents do not hesitate to give their devices to their children to keep them engaged. This practice is hardly shocking in a country where most parents themselves are digitally illiterate. This exposes the children to harmful online spaces at a very young age. Children are naturally curious and seek validation, so people easily manipulate them online. Predators groom them into sharing nudes and personal information and even meeting in real life. The offences can turn into blackmail and threats or sextortion, where abusers demand money from the victim to keep images private, scarring the children for life. Usually, the number of crime reports does not reflect the reality as many children keep it to themselves and suffer silently. These days, children are often more comfortable making friends online than in real life. There are ample online dating and chatting sites, gaming apps and social media platforms where one can communicate with strangers. In many cases, online sexual abuse culminates in real-life sexual violence. According to a Post report, a 13-year-old girl was sexually abused online and later raped by a 20-year-old man whom she met through an online gaming app, FreeFire. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence, child sexual exploitation online is taking new heights with deepfake and other generative AI content. According to the Internet Watch Foundation, the amount of AI-made illegal content related to child sexual abuse over the past six months has already exceeded the previous year’s total. Moreover, it also states how the dark web isn’t the only problem, as almost all the content found was on publicly available areas online. While Nepal has implemented laws to combat online child abuse, these regulations are nowhere near enough to oversee the rapidly evolving technologies. The Electronic Transactions Act 2008 does not explicitly address online child sexual abuse. Moreover, the Act Relating to Children 2018 fails to define child pornography, grooming, sextortion or cyberstalking, which are recurring activities involved in online child sexual abuse. The Ministry of Women, Citizens and Senior Citizens in 2021 approved the Online Child Protection Procedure in 2021, where restricting children’s access to harmful content online was stated as the duty of internet service providers; however, that hasn’t been effective. This is why it is vital that our legal mechanisms are strengthened and simple and accessible child-friendly online safety resources created. Additionally, it is imperative to spread awareness of online abuse and sexual exploitation through school curriculums.

He resigned from the position in 2009, after which he dedicated himself in the study of national and international politics. The Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed him to serve on several high-level panels—for Bangladesh’s 2008 parliamentary elections and for South Sudan’s referendum process in 2010-11. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Pokharel to better understand Nepal’s own electoral system and the influence of big business on its political parties.The latest episode of Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land to CPN-UML and his announcement of a sophisticated party office building at the land has of late been a topic of hot debate. People see this as an example of how politicians and businessmen work in collusion. How do you see it?Our legal provisions in this connection have some loopholes. The law allows political parties to collect donations to run their organisations, to contest elections and to carry out other activities. The law is silent on who can make such donations and how much they can do it. This is a gap in our law. Our political parties have for long been misusing the loopholes, and now they are doing so openly. The laws have also identified some sources of income for the parties such as the levy by their members, donations they get and the incomes the parties make in various ways. The amount they earn from these sources is negligible. But most major corruption cases, and mainly policy-related corruption, are linked to those who fund the political parties. This in turn is linked to the trend of elections increasingly becoming expensive. Politicians need money and those with money need access to powerful politicians. So, this is mutually beneficial for politicians and businesspeople. Such activities have been taking place for decades, but the level of such collusion has increased significantly of late.Is accepting donations from Gurung problematic as there are pending corruption and fraud cases against him or is accepting donations from business people inherently questionable?Our law hasn’t set clear criteria in this connection. Laws in some countries have categorically defined certain fundamental things such as from whom parties can take donations, how much and what type of money they can accept and how to make the deal transparent. In developed democracies, political financing is strictly monitored and regulated. In our case, we didn’t even fix the limit of the amount a businessperson can donate to a political party and whether that should be linked to the profit and tax the person pays to the state. Even the individuals who haven’t paid tax to the state citing losses in their businesses might be donating big sums to political parties or individual politicians. Therefore, there should be certain criteria to regulate political financing. Certain provisions empower the Election Commission to take action. For instance, if someone wants to help a political party or a candidate financially with more than Rs25,000, the person has to give the money through a bank. The commission can cancel someone’s candidacy or take other actions if the candidate is found to have made excessive expenses in breach of election laws. But our agencies are weak in terms of enforcement. The political parties submit the details of their financial transactions but that is often audited by a chartered accountant who might be a party cadre. The Election Commission hasn’t succeeded in investigating such malpractices. Will a law on conflict of interest help control such malpractices?We need a couple of things soon. First, the state should formulate and enforce a law on conflict of interest. It will define certain issues on conflict of interest involving politicians, business people and other stakeholders and make the officials making decisions accountable. Second, there is a need to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t. Of late, there is tendency of making decisions from Cabinet meetings to avoid prosecution from the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) as the anti-corruption body is not allowed to investigate Cabinet’s policy decisions. The CIAA leadership has an excuse not to get involved in the decisions of the politicians who appoint them. All Cabinet decisions are not policy decisions. So, it has become urgent to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t and what kind of issues the CIAA and other investigating agencies can investigate.People in general say that corruption has of late increased. Is that the case?There is no society completely free of corruption. I have been observing the functioning of our state mechanisms for the past five decades. During the Panchayat [1960-1990], everything was controlled by the palace. And, the royals and their kin were linked when there was a high-level corruption case. In the 1980s, a corruption case involving the procurement of a Boeing surfaced. A commission led by a Supreme Court justice showed the involvement of prince Gyanendra [who later became King] but its report was not implemented as the then King Birendra didn’t muster the courage to take action against his own brother. At the time, politicians didn’t dare to get involved in serious corruption cases as there was a fear of action from the palace. Over time, the volume of corruption increased with the increment in the amount of financial transactions. There is corruption even in countries like Japan and South Korea that have made exemplary progress in development. Leaders including prime ministers, ministers have been prosecuted and even faced jail terms on corruption charges. Based on that, some argue that corruption is somehow attached to development because there is mobilisation of huge resources. But there is a big difference with what is happening here. There, they take action against whoever is involved. Presidents and prime ministers have been jailed, some have even committed suicide. But in our case, top political leadership is not prosecuted. The other aspect is that after the reinstatement of democracy and the start of the republican order, the media made more corruption cases public, which was not the case during the King’s regime.Do you see any connection between the political parties and the rampant corruption in recent decades?Our party organisations became too burdensome. In developed democracies, political parties become active when there is a need for their role. At other times, they go ‘into hibernation’. The party leaders and members return to their regular businesses and remain busy there. For instance, at present, the Democrats and Republicans in the US have concentrated all their energy to help their respective candidates win. Once the election is over, they return to their regular businesses. Similar is the situation in other developed democracies. This happens when a democracy attains maturity. Conversely, in our case, the cadres are totally dependent on their organisations. And even general people want things done through party channels. From the grassroots to the centre, people go to party offices for recommendations to get something done from government agencies. This is how parties have become parallel power centres to the state agencies. The government bodies have been weakened. Hence, the way our political organisations, their leaders and cadres are managed has become the source of corruption. And it has weakened elected governments because they aren’t allowed to work independently. Government officials are also forced to work as per the order given by a head of the local chapter of a political party, not by the elected representatives with people’s mandate.There is another more concerning trend. These days the government’s decisions are influenced by certain interest groups that have huge money. There are around two dozen big business houses who influence the state’s decision-making process no matter which party leads the government. First they make informal decisions on certain key issues. Then, the Parliament, a government agency, or a court, whichever is concerned, endorses it. So now the real power doesn’t lie with elected representatives or state agencies. The interest groups wield real power.How to stop it?The state should fund political parties to cover their genuine expenses such as election expenditures and regular costs needed to run party organisations. This helps break the nexus between politicians and business tycoons and to check corruption. Once the political parties get money from state coffers, their expenditures will be strictly regulated by the law. They won’t be allowed to take outside donations. After that, the Office of the Auditor General will audit their accounts.But how can we ensure the parties and their leaders are taking no donations even after they get state funding?The law will bar both the donors and recipients from being involved in offering and taking donations. Then, the donors can say that they can’t give money to the political parties as that will be a crime of breaching the law. The policy only works if the state agencies strongly enforce the law.Other countries have made huge progress in terms of development despite corruption being rampant there. Why do we lag behind?We adopted the form of governance that accepts Parliament as the most sovereign body. But, in reality, the power lies with the chiefs of three major parties. The Parliament rubber stamps whatever they decide. And, they are influenced by certain interest groups. The legislature seeks political parties’ decisions even to follow its procedures. The other most powerful institution as per our constitution is the prime minister. But, in reality, the prime minister always struggles to appease coalition partners. Another important state pillar is the judiciary, which has been weakened by politicisation. Constitutional bodies could have played an important check and balance role but the politicians wanted to use them to serve their interests. With the weakening and non-functioning of state agencies, misrule prevails. In other countries, laws and state agencies work, and therefore they progressed.Is there a viable way to clean up our corrupt system? First the leaders that messed things up and brought the country to this situation should retire. The leaders who led historic political movements have failed to maintain their height. The narrative of ‘there is no hope’ has spread. This will not stop unless the present leadership retires. Things will improve if they voluntarily retire from politics. But they aren’t ready for that.How do you evaluate the present government’s performance after its 100 days in office?I was optimistic at the beginning and expected that they would work differently and instil hope in the people, mainly on good governance. But they gave continuity to the same mistakes they committed in the past. As the two largest parties are in the government, they have a chance to sow hope in the country, but the signs in the past 100 days aren’t encouraging. They deserve credit for the initiative to amend transitional justice related laws and to begin the process to constitute the two TJ bodies. Also, the government successfully restored connection of the Kathmandu Valley with other parts of the country after the devastating floods and landslides.Our major concern is that if this experiment of a government of two largest parties fails, it will raise questions over our system. It won’t be limited to the failure of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, it will be projected as a failure of the system. A number of groups are unhappy with the system the present constitution adopted in 2015. The governing parties’ failure will give them a ground to raise questions over the system, at a time when a large section of the society is fed up with seeing “the same old faces”. Individual leaders’ failure may push our democratic system in a crisis. This is more concerning. At the time of forming this coalition, they said that they joined hands due to the special circumstances of the country. But they didn’t work as per the special needs.You wrote a book entitled Preventing Election Violence Through Diplomacy in 2020 after a comprehensive research on some African countries. Do you see any similarities between politics of Africa and Nepal?In the course of that research, I studied some elected as well as non-elected dictators in Africa and Latin America. The dictators always think along the lines of ‘me and mine’. Instead of strengthening state agencies, they want to turn the agencies in their favour. Over time, some dictators realise they are making one mistake after another and they reach a point where they want to quit. But the coterie that surrounds the leader doesn’t allow him or her to quit. Those who are benefitting from the rule even threaten to kill the dictator if he/she plans to call it quits. Then, the dictators want some external intervention, beyond the tight circle. I found such circumstances in my case studies. It is so unfortunate that I see something similar happening in Nepal. The way a group of people encircle our top leaders and defend even their wrongdoings, it gives me a feeling of deja vu. In our case, some leaders are advised not to quit as a true successor has not been groomed.  ","summary":"Former chief election commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel successfully conducted the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008.

He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isn’t possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the country’s largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oli’s acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We can’t say anything about the government agencies’ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies can’t enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSP’s concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperatives’ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhane’s case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepal’s development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal can’t progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them weren’t built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people aren’t brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individuals’ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies can’t take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai—were not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers weren’t prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the party’s transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our party’s agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesn’t mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party can’t accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our party’s present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance. ","summary":"During his term as home minister in the previous Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government that was toppled in mid-July, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who is also senior vice-chair of the CPN (Maoist Centre), undertook some bold actions. He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal].

At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies. ","summary":"Central and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world.

Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. ","summary":"Nepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back.

The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority. ","summary":"The parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate cooperatives scam submitted its report last week. The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws.
