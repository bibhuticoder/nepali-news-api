However, according to the verdict, those residing on the riverbanks, because of various compulsions, must be relocated to the government-built apartments at Ichangu Narayan on the western rim of Kathmandu and other locations if those facilities are not enough.“Those unwilling to reside in the property allotted to them must be removed from the encroached areas, and they should get necessary funds to shift to other places by respecting their rights to housing enshrined in Article 37 (1) of the Constitution of Nepal,” reads one of the points in the verdict. Every citizen in Nepal has a constitutional right to appropriate housing.As many as 230 housing units were built in the Ichangu Narayan area by the former Baburam Bhattarai-led government to house squatters from the Bagmati corridor. Between 2010 and 2012, the Department of Urban Development and Building Construction purchased over eight ropani (0.4 hectares) of land in the area, which falls in ward 2 of Nargarjun Municipality. Though the construction that began in July 2012 was completed in September 2014, the squatters refused to relocate citing accessibility issues, saying Ichangu Narayan was too far from the city centre.Currently, the apartment blocks are partially used by the Manav Sewa Ashram, a non-profit that provides shelter for the homeless, and by a police unit. The court verdict states, “The properties should be used for the purpose for which they were constructed.”Different attempts were made at different times to clear the encroached river banks in the Kathmandu Valley. Every time, such attempts failed because the initiatives were taken without proper homework, while there was strong resistance from squatters. Last time, it was the Kathmandu Metropolitan City which had made such an attempt, but it was met with fierce opposition and criticism.However, passing a verdict on the writ petition filed by senior advocate Prakash Mani Sharma and his colleagues, the top court has paved the way for removing the illegal riverbank settlements, but with alternatives for relocation. Sharma had filed a petition seeking the court’s intervention in protecting the Bagmati River and its tributaries. The Bhattarai-led bench has also asked the government and subordinate authorities to identify genuine landless squatters and make plans to clear encroached areas. The top court has emphasised that, except for parks and playgrounds, no government or public infrastructure can be allowed within 20 metres on both sides of rivers.The full text of the verdict issued on December 19, 2023, was made public on Monday evening. “Though some efforts have been made towards the conservation of the Bagmati and its tributaries, the results are not satisfactory,” reads the verdict citing various reports that show high levels of pollution in the rivers. The division bench has also asked law enforcement agencies to implement the Environment Protection Act, which has several provisions for tackling river pollution.Besides ordering squatter relocation, the court has directed the authorities to construct reservoirs at the headwaters of the Bishnumati, Tukucha, and Dhobikhola rivers, just like in the Bagmati, and also set up sewerage treatment plants where necessary. The court ruling has made it mandatory for houses to construct a septic tank along with a soak pit for rainwater harvesting that supports recharging groundwater. “Don’t approve house design without septic tank and soak pit,” the verdict directs all the local units within Kathmandu Valley. It has also asked the High Powered Committee for Integrated Development of the Bagmati Civilisation to create a mechanism comprising the chiefs of all local units in the Kathmandu Valley for a coordinated effort towards river conservation.“Appoint pollution inspectors to monitor the activities that pollute rivers and take actions based on their reports,” the division bench has said.

The international financial institution released the full text of the IMF staff country report on Tuesday. It warned that problems in the savings and cooperatives sector are expanding.The main cause of the failure is investment in illiquid and underperforming assets of cooperatives, which impact repayment capacity, combined with some cases of fraud.The IMF said in the statement that a combination of large data gaps, weak governance, unsound credit and liquidity risk management, and a lack of licensing, effective regulation, monitoring, and supervision resulted in the failure and closure of multiple cooperatives.On May 28, the lower house formed a seven-member parliamentary committee to investigate cooperatives fraud.Immediate past home minister Rabi Lamichhane, who is also president of Rastriya Swatantra Party, has been accused of embezzling millions of rupees from multiple cooperatives while he headed the Gorkha Media Network before entering politics.The IMF said that authorities need a comprehensive strategy to deal with the issues in cooperatives.It said that over 14,000 cooperatives hold an estimated Rs478 billion of savings deposits, one-twelfth the size of banking sector deposits as of June 2023.“There is an increasing risk of negative spillovers to other cooperatives and the smallest regulated banks,” the IMF said. On Tuesday, a delegation of the Central Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation Department of the ruling CPN-UML submitted a 12-point suggestion to the newly appointed minister for Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, Balaram Adhikari. “We have suggested ensuring that depositors’ money is safe in cooperatives,” said Khagraj Adhikari, chief of the department and former chief minister of Gandaki Province. “We have demanded immediate action against the people involved in the irregularities and cooperatives fraud.” He said the cooperatives, which can be established as a strong economic pillar, need major reforms. The delegation has recommended forming a high-level, powerful task force to address the issues in the sector. The erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government, on May 28, while unveiling the budget for 2024-25, had promised to return at least Rs500,000 to each depositor by recovering it from the directors’ assets. Yet doubts persist over whether depositors will get their money back.Some economists have warned about potential mass protests if the cooperatives issue is not resolved soon.The IMF has recommended a strategy of central coordination of the 761 district and provincial cooperatives regulators to facilitate the cleanup of the problematic cooperatives. It said that reforms in the supervisory and regulatory architecture are needed. “Given likely limited resources, this strategy needs to ensure that the largest financially sound cooperatives remain stable and are appropriately regulated while dealing with problematic cooperatives.”Nepal has a large and vibrant cooperative sector regulated by many agencies. There are around 32,000 registered cooperatives. In addition to cooperatives, which focus on providing savings and loan services, cooperatives are active in areas such as agriculture, forestry and several other activities. These non-financial cooperatives can allocate up to 30 percent of their activities to savings and loan services. According to the IMF, there are more than 14,000 cooperatives and around 10,000 non-financial cooperatives that also provide financial services. As of June 2023, cooperatives held Rs478 billion in savings deposits and Rs426 billion in assets. Cooperatives are regulated based on their geographical scope—at the federal, provincial, or local level. As a result, there are a maximum of 761 different regulators. If a cooperative is declared problematic, the relevant regulator must appoint a Problematic Cooperatives Asset Management Committee. Since mid-2023, pressures in the Nepali cooperatives have been mounting. Gauri Bahadur Karki, former chair of the Special Court and the head of an inquiry commission formed in 2013 to investigate troubled saving and credit cooperatives, told the Post last year that cooperatives were in trouble after the government halted plotting of land in 2022. “Most cooperatives’ operation model involves investing in land and paying interest after generating profits from selling such land. With the government abruptly halting plotting, many cooperatives failed to sell the land, which resulted in their failure to pay promised interest, and the depositors who could not recover their money had to stage protests.”According to Karki, other problems included investing in land and misappropriation of funds by the cooperatives’ promoters.The IMF said that the Department of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, and subnational authorities are reportedly declaring an increasing number of cooperatives problematic, implying the need for decisive intervention to prevent further contagion. The IMF has recommended three kinds of steps to deal with the issue: immediate steps, near-term steps (within one year), and medium-term steps (1-2 years).In the immediate steps, the IMF has recommended halting the registration of new cooperatives. The current registration does not provide the same scrutiny as licensing, and adequate supervision is not currently guaranteed. It said a temporary stop on registering new cooperatives at federal, provincial, and local levels until the issues have been addressed and the licensing and supervisory process and capacity have been improved would be appropriate. “Resolution options in the strategy should follow the existing legal framework and could focus on liquidation combined with repayment of savings of failed cooperatives, possibly the transfer of assets and liabilities of failed cooperatives to healthy cooperatives or their continuation after restructuring.” Near-term steps involve tightening and enforcing existing regulatory requirements. The recent crisis reveals flaws in applying the legislative and regulatory framework. The bar for cooperatives must be raised while customising the requirements to the size and nature of the businesses and a realistic supervision capacity. Authorities could tighten existing regulatory requirements in capitalisation, liquidity, loan concentration, and governance. Cooperatives should be required to report regularly. They could be given a certain period to meet the requirements, and compliance with these needs to be closely monitored. The medium-term step involves starting to license cooperatives. As a proper authorisation and licensing process hasn’t been established under the current regime, licensing is needed for both existing cooperatives and new entities.The licensing regime should include a mechanism for the regulator to verify compliance and a process for treating cases of significant non-compliance (which could result in the withdrawal or suspension of the licence). The IMF has recommended ensuring that the Cooperatives Act includes creating a debt information centre, credit tribunal, and savings and guarantee fund for cooperatives. These institutions could be aligned with existing structures, the global organisation said. For example, the debt information centre could be set up within the Credit Information Bureau, allowing all financial institutions access to information on debtors. The savings and guarantee fund could be modelled on the Nepali Deposit Insurance System, which the country started in 2010. Under this scheme, deposit guarantee coverage is up to Rs500,000 per individual per member institution, applicable to savings and fixed deposits.

A minister told the Post that a Cabinet meeting on Monday decided to give Sharma a half-month extension. However, the decision has not been relayed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as the Nepali Embassy in New Delhi.Ruling party leaders, especially those from the Nepali Congress, had communicated to Sharma not to return to Kathmandu immediately due to the unfolding political situation here.Sharma was appointed the ambassador to India in March, 2022 in the Congress quota. The new foreign minister, Arzu Rana, belongs to the Congress party.Sharma is among the 11 ambassadors recalled by the coalition government of the CPN-UML, the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party on June 6. Most of them have arrived in Kathmandu and reported to the foreign ministry. Sharma is the only ambassador to get an extension due to some technical reasons and the change in political equation in Kathmandu, officials at the Prime Minister's Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.Sharma had also requested the foreign ministry for more time to return citing that he has not completed farewell calls in New Delhi including to S Jaishankar, the external affairs minister.Sharma's recall, days before the visit of the previous prime minister Dahal to India, had courted controversy.Although the government clarified that recalling ambassadors is regular business, experts had cautioned that recalling Sharma just ahead of Dahal’s visit for the inauguration of Narendra Modi’s third term as India’s prime minister last month sent a negative message and dented the country’s diplomatic image.Upon return, Dahal admitted his “mistake” of having not considered the sensitivity and timing of Sharma's recall.Speaking to reporters on June 6, then-minister for communication and information technology, Rekha Sharma, clarified that there was no connection between the decision to recall the ambassadors and Dahal's India visit.The same Dahal-led government then recommended former ambassador and chief secretary Lok Darshan Regmi to replace Sharma. It also recommended ambassadors for eight countries. However, their status is in limbo, said a senior foreign ministry official.With the Congress now in power, whether Sharma's job in Delhi will continue or Regmi, recommended in the quota of CPN-UML, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s party, will get the go-ahead, is unclear, according to foreign ministry officials. What to do with the ambassador nominees is a political decision, said a joint-secretary at the foreign ministry. The further process like sending the names of the nominees to the parliamentary hearing special committee is yet to be done.With the change in government, a comprehensive review of ambassadorial appointments may be done but the issue has not been discussed among the ruling parties, political leaders said.The Oli-led government is likely to recall more ambassadors appointed under the quotas allotted to the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the CPN (Unified Socialist).Recommended by the two parties, four ambassadors are currently serving in China, Russia, Australia and South Africa. The government might recall them and adjust the new appointments, a Congress leader suggested. Amrit Rai, spokesperson for the foreign ministry, said he is not aware of extra time given to Sharma to wrap up his engagements in Delhi. Sharma did not answer the Post’s repeated phone calls. ","summary":"The government has extended the term of Nepali Ambassador to India Shankar Prasad Sharma by fifteen days, after being recalled weeks ago by the Pushpa Kamal Dahal administration. A minister told the Post that a Cabinet meeting on Monday decided to give Sharma a half-month extension. However, the decision has not been relayed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as the Nepali Embassy in New Delhi.Ruling party leaders, especially those from the Nepali Congress, had communicated to Sharma not to return to Kathmandu immediately due to the unfolding political situation here.Sharma was appointed the ambassador to India in March, 2022 in the Congress quota.

Provincial and local government agencies have been requested to coordinate with private schools and other stakeholders to implement the programme.”Anaemia is a condition in which blood produces low levels of haemoglobin or healthy red blood cells. Iron and other nutritional deficiencies, malaria, hookworm infection, chronic infections, and genetic conditions, including sickle cell diseases, are among the causes for anaemia. Studies show that 39 percent of girls aged 10 and 19 years and 21 percent of boys of the same age group suffer from anaemia in Nepal. Health authorities however, have been preparing the supplement administration programme only for girls.Health officials said that they have also been considering providing the supplement tablets to boys as well, as several countries have already started administering iron-folic acid to boys.Doctors say anaemia in adults can cause fatigue, lethargy, reduced physical productivity, and poor work performance. It is a major concern among pregnant women, as problems can lead to increased maternal mortality rates and poor birth outcomes.The Health Ministry has been providing the supplement at government schools across the country since 2016. Some local levels had already been administering the supplement tablets in private schools.Thapa said that all schools, whether government or private, will implement the supplementation programme from the new fiscal year. Under the programme, eligible girls will be administered a supplement tablet every week for three months. They will be administered the tablet again after three months and continued for 13 weeks. Thapa said that 26 supplement tablets will be administered per person in a year.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 conducted by the ministry shows that 43 percent of the children aged between six to 59 months have been found to be anaemic—25 percent mildly anaemic, 18 percent moderately anaemic and one percent severely anaemic.The prevalence of anaemia in children aged between six to 59 months has decreased from 53 percent in 2016 to 43 percent in 2022. However, the trend has not been consistently downward. In 2006, around 48 percent of children were found to be anaemic. Prevalence of anaemia in the above-mentioned age group was found to be high—50.6 percent in the Madhesh Province, followed by 48.9 percent in Lumbini, 45.4 percent in Sudurpaschim, 42.5 percent in Bagmati, 39.8 percent in Karnali, 33.9 percent in Koshi and 30.7 percent in Gandaki Province.Women living in the Tarai region are more likely to be anaemic (45 percent) than those living in the hills (20 percent) and in the mountainous regions (23 percent), the survey showed. More than half the women (52 percent) are anaemic in the Madhesh Province.In the 1990s, 75 percent of pregnant women in Nepal were found to be suffering from anaemia.Anaemia during pregnancy increases the risk of foetal growth retardation and low birth weight, premature delivery, increased perinatal mortality, and reduced resistance to infection for both mother and baby. Thapa said anaemia is a serious concern for children as it can impair their cognitive development and can have long-term health and economic implications for society. He said that health agencies have been asked to conduct classes in schools to make students aware of hygienic behaviour, nutritious food, and the negative effects of junk food on health.Meanwhile, the Department of Drug Administration has recalled Folicare Tablet (folic acid tablet) batch TES-032 manufactured by Nepali pharmaceutical company Curex Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd due to quality issues.

Vance, who opposes military aid for Ukraine and warned Europe will have to rely less on the United States to defend the continent, as his candidate for vice president.Trump sparked fierce criticism from Western officials for suggesting he would not protect countries that failed to meet the transatlantic military alliance’s defence spending targets and would even encourage Russia to attack them.Germany has faced criticism for repeatedly missing a NATO target of spending 2% of its economic output on defence.Depleted military stocksThe stocks of Germany’s armed forces, already run down by decades of underinvestment, have been further depleted by arms supplies to Kyiv.So far, Berlin has donated three Patriot air defence units to Kyiv, more than any other country, bringing down the number of Patriot systems in Germany to nine.Germany’s fractious coalition of left-leaning Social Democrats, pro-business liberals and ecologist Greens has struggled to comply with NATO’s spending target due to self-imposed rules that limit the amount of state borrowing they can take on.Although military aid to Ukraine will be cut, Germany will comply with the NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defence in 2025, with a total of 75.3 billion euros.Days after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a “Zeitenwende” – German for historic turning point - with a 100 billion euro special fund to bring the military up to speed.From this special fund, there will be 22.0 billion euros more for defence, plus 53.3 billion euros in the regular budget, still less than that sought by Defence Minister Boris Pistorius.The budget for 2025 comes with the mid-term financial planning until 2028, the year when the armed forces’ special fund to meet NATO’s minimum spending goals is due to run out and 80 billion will be needed for defence, as noted in the financial plan.In 2028, there is a gap of 39 billion euros in the regular budget, of which 28 billion euros are needed to comply with the NATO target without the special fund, sources from the finance ministry said.Decisions on how the hole will be plugged are not likely to be taken until after the 2025 election.“The 80 billion euros that have been put on display for 2028 simply do not exist,” said Ingo Gaedechens, member of the parliament’s budget committee from the conservative opposition party CDU.“The coalition is not even trying to cover this up but are openly admitting it.” "},{"hash":"36e5cbc108242a199b16421d41a3e9f6a45b3be0b239a6c37e93e9b1043c7d03","title":"KP Oli's journey from rebel to Prime Minister:\n\n- Led student protests against the monarchy\n- Founded the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist)\n- Imprisoned for political activities\n- Became Prime Minister in 2015\n- Known for his populist policies and nationalist stance","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/videos/2024/07/17/from-rebel-to-prime-minister-the-ascent-of-kp-oli","date":1721174400000,"source":"kp","category":"videos","content":"Nepalese leader known for nationalism and anti-India stance, marked by territorial claims and a strong stance during the Nepal blockade.","summary":"He is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man?

Meanwhile, Mahindra Raya Yadav of Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party attended the meeting as the new entrant of the Front.The JSP-Nepal chief boycotted the meeting as he held a serious grudge against Dahal. Former prime minister Dahal is not only accused of masterminding the split of JSP-Nepal but is also blamed for weakening the Socialist Front while in power.Soon after the party split, JSP-Nepal chair Upendra Yadav questioned the Front's relevance. Janata Samajbadi Party, formed by a splinter faction of JSP-Nepal, however, has not joined the Front. The new outfit, which is led by Ashok Rai, has seven lawmakers in the federal parliament while the mother party led by Yadav has five.CPN (Unified Socialist) leader and National Assembly lawmaker Beduram Bhusal, however, claims there is no ground to accuse Dahal. “It is true that despite being a member of the Front, member parties have taken arbitrary decisions favourable to their party,” Bhusal told the Post. “But this does not mean that Dahal had tried to foil the Front.”Agni Sapkota, the Maoist Centre leader who attended the Front’s meeting on Tuesday, told the Post that the members, who had met after a hiatus, took stock of the changed political scenario.“At the meeting, we concluded that the Congress-UML alliance can undermine the achievements in the name of constitution amendment, though their agreement is yet to be made public,” Sapkota told the Post. “We have decided to critically analyse every move of the newly formed government.”Tuesday's meeting of the Front also constituted a four-member task force to review the Front’s journey and suggest a way forward. The task force consists of Khadga Bishwakarma from Chand’ party, Ganga Narayan Shrestha from Nepal Samajbadi Party, Pramesh Hamal from Unified Socialist and Dev Gurung from Maoist Centre. They have been given a 15-day timeframe to submit their report.Meanwhile, detractors question the Front’s relevance. Manish Kumar Suman, a JSP-Nepal leader, said that the relevance of the Socialist Front ended after Dahal publicly accepted playing a role to split the JSP-Nepal. “Dahal is trying to activate the Front out of desperation after being ousted from power,” Suman said.Soon after the JSP-Nepal split on May 5, Dahal, while speaking at a function of his party, had said he would do anything to remain in power, indicating his role in the party split. The JSP-Nepal was split on the pretext that some lawmakers from JSP-Nepal and Unified Socialist were approaching the then main opposition Nepali Congress to form a government while both the fringe parties were in the Dahal government.But Bhusal said that the JSP-Nepal leaders might have provided such harsh assessment of the Front as they were in pain of party division, which is natural.Socialist Front was formed with a spirit to strengthen collaboration between the left-leaning political parties. But Dahal used it for his political gain, Suman accused. “Only after being ousted from the government did Dahal try to activate the Socialist Front,” he said.Dahal was ousted from the government after he failed to win the parliament’s trust after his coalition’s largest partner, the CPN-UML, reached a deal with Nepali Congress on July 1 to form the new government.The Front was formed after years of discussion among some left-leaning political parties. However, Baburam Bhattarai, a longtime advocate of the socialist front, was later left out. Instead of Bhattarai, the Netra Bikram Chand ‘Biplav'-led Communist Party of Nepal was inducted into the bloc.When formed last year, the Socialist Front had 54 members in Parliament. The Maoist Centre was the largest among them, with 32 seats, followed by JSP-Nepal, with 12 seats at the time, and Unified Socialist’s 10 seats. But now the Front only has 43 members, including Mahindra Raya Yadav, the chair of Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party. Bhusal, the Unified Socialist vice-chair, argued that the number of lawmakers does not affect the Front’s functioning. “The Front was established to strengthen collaboration between the like-minded left-leaning parties so it has nothing to do with the Parliamentary affairs,” Bhusal said.The primary concept paper of the alliance says that the Socialist Front was established with “a basic commitment to federalism, democracy, republicanism, inclusion, and secularism—the five basic key features of the Constitution of Nepal.” Though the Front vowed to release the detailed concept later, it has yet to do so.The primary concept paper released during the inauguration on July 8 last year also states ‘amending the constitution’ as one of its objectives. However, the Maoist Centre, the leading force of the Socialist Front, is criticising the Congress-UML coalition government for including the constitutional amendment as one of its objectives.But Maoist Centre leaders claimed the constitution amendment mentioned in their concept paper is different from what the Congress-UML alliance is trying to do.“It is true that the primary concept paper released by Front last year also mentions the constitution amendment, but it is with the forward looking approach, but the objective of the Congress-UML alliance is different,” Sapkota argued. “We suspect they want to abolish the Proportional Representation system from the electoral system apart from other achievements, which would be a regressive move. We won’t let it happen.”Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, echoed Sapkota. “The Socialist Front was advocating for enriching the constitution and making it more progressive by amending it, but the objective of the Congress-UML alliance is different,” Pokharel said.Dahal harped on the idea of forming the Socialist Front after the dissolution of the Nepal Communist Party, considered to be the most powerful communist force in Nepal’s history, in early 2021.During a meeting held on March 22, the Front's member parties decided to try to get the CPN-UML, the largest communist party, on board the Socialist Front. They floated the idea as Dahal at the time ditched the Congress and brought the UML on board the ruling coalition.Now with the UML ditching the Maoist Centre and forming the government with Congress, the chances of their participation in the Front has ended for now. But then, the UML, the country’s largest communist party, was never so positive about the idea of forming Socialist Front.

The JSP-Nepal was split on the pretext that some lawmakers from JSP-Nepal and Unified Socialist were approaching the then main opposition Nepali Congress to form a government while both the fringe parties were in the Dahal government.But Bhusal said that the JSP-Nepal leaders might have provided such harsh assessment of the Front as they were in pain of party division, which is natural.Socialist Front was formed with a spirit to strengthen collaboration between the left-leaning political parties. But Dahal used it for his political gain, Suman accused. “Only after being ousted from the government did Dahal try to activate the Socialist Front,” he said.Dahal was ousted from the government after he failed to win the parliament’s trust after his coalition’s largest partner, the CPN-UML, reached a deal with Nepali Congress on July 1 to form the new government.The Front was formed after years of discussion among some left-leaning political parties. However, Baburam Bhattarai, a longtime advocate of the socialist front, was later left out. Instead of Bhattarai, the Netra Bikram Chand ‘Biplav'-led Communist Party of Nepal was inducted into the bloc.When formed last year, the Socialist Front had 54 members in Parliament. The Maoist Centre was the largest among them, with 32 seats, followed by JSP-Nepal, with 12 seats at the time, and Unified Socialist’s 10 seats. But now the Front only has 43 members, including Mahindra Raya Yadav, the chair of Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party. Bhusal, the Unified Socialist vice-chair, argued that the number of lawmakers does not affect the Front’s functioning. “The Front was established to strengthen collaboration between the like-minded left-leaning parties so it has nothing to do with the Parliamentary affairs,” Bhusal said.The primary concept paper of the alliance says that the Socialist Front was established with “a basic commitment to federalism, democracy, republicanism, inclusion, and secularism—the five basic key features of the Constitution of Nepal.” Though the Front vowed to release the detailed concept later, it has yet to do so.The primary concept paper released during the inauguration on July 8 last year also states ‘amending the constitution’ as one of its objectives. However, the Maoist Centre, the leading force of the Socialist Front, is criticising the Congress-UML coalition government for including the constitutional amendment as one of its objectives.But Maoist Centre leaders claimed the constitution amendment mentioned in their concept paper is different from what the Congress-UML alliance is trying to do.“It is true that the primary concept paper released by Front last year also mentions the constitution amendment, but it is with the forward looking approach, but the objective of the Congress-UML alliance is different,” Sapkota argued. “We suspect they want to abolish the Proportional Representation system from the electoral system apart from other achievements, which would be a regressive move. We won’t let it happen.”Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, echoed Sapkota. “The Socialist Front was advocating for enriching the constitution and making it more progressive by amending it, but the objective of the Congress-UML alliance is different,” Pokharel said.Dahal harped on the idea of forming the Socialist Front after the dissolution of the Nepal Communist Party, considered to be the most powerful communist force in Nepal’s history, in early 2021.During a meeting held on March 22, the Front's member parties decided to try to get the CPN-UML, the largest communist party, on board the Socialist Front. They floated the idea as Dahal at the time ditched the Congress and brought the UML on board the ruling coalition.Now with the UML ditching the Maoist Centre and forming the government with Congress, the chances of their participation in the Front has ended for now. But then, the UML, the country’s largest communist party, was never so positive about the idea of forming Socialist Front.

In comparison, imports from India fell by 3.1 percent.Experts attributed ballooning imports from China to a sharp rise in the entry of electric vehicles (EVs). Likewise, a fall in imports from India has been attributed to the export curbs on food by the southern neighbour. In terms of value, imports from China increased by Rs70.44 billion to Rs272.81 billion in the review period.Import from India, however, dropped by Rs29.53 billion to Rs908.30 billion in the period.Due to the drop in imports from India, Nepal’s total imports declined 1.8 percent to Rs1.45 trillion in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year, which ended mid-June 2024.An official of the National Statistics Office says for a consumption-driven economy, falling imports are a worrisome sign. This suggests people are spending less on services and consumption while exports are stagnant.Rabindra Duwadi, the spokesperson at the Trade and Export Promotion Center, said imports from the north were driven by a massive influx of EVs, smartphones, and readymade garments.Besides, exports of iron, chemical fertiliser, apples and readymade garments too rose significantly. Traders said that China fulfils 80 percent of Nepal's readymade garment needs. The country imported readymade garments worth Rs33.67 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year.In the same vein, Nepal imported 7,931 EVs worth Rs21.83 billion from China in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, up from 1,269 EVs worth Rs3.75 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Similarly, the country imported 1.23 million units of smartphones worth Rs17.27 billion from China in the review period. During the time, Nepal imported 99,965 tonnes of chemical fertiliser worth Rs8.69 billion from China.In the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, the country imported 65,827 tonnes of apples worth Rs6.98 billion from China, compared to 50,153 tonnes worth Rs4.73 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Duwadi said India’s share of Nepal’s total imports is 65.5 percent, while China contributes 18.8 percent. Traders say Nepal’s trade with India is vast, but it is steadily shifting to China. “One key reason for import growth from China is EVs,” said Rajan Sharma, a trade expert. “Chinese EVs are comparatively cheaper and perform better compared to Indian ones.” According to market observers, that’s why there has been an abrupt switch from India’s Tata Nexon EV to Chinese BYD.Sharma said readymade garments imported from China are cheaper compared to Indian readymade garments, including branded ones, which makes them popular among Nepali customers. “At the same time, India-made branded clothing items are expensive.”The Chinese Shein clothing brand has quickly gained popularity in Nepal due to its trendy clothes and reasonable prices.Trade experts say that due to the open border, there has been a massive rise in informal trade from India in recent years. Smuggling has thrived after India imposed a ban on foods.According to a research report titled, ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,’ prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, only 40 percent of rice is imported from India through formal channels.India’s share in Nepal’s imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the share of informal trade is likely to be higher.The research has pointed out that informal trade has thrived after the imposition of a 9 percent agriculture reform fee and a 2.5 percent advanced income tax, resulting in a total duty of 11.5 percent on rice imports.The paper said that India’s ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food through the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India.Nepal is dependent on onions imported from India. When the Indian government imposed a ban on onion exports from December 2023 to May 2024, the product was readily available in the vegetable market and grocery stores, which indicated that a massive quantity of onions came through informal trade channels.The government did not take a single step to control the illegal trade or negotiate with the Indian government to ease the repeated bans on export of various agricultural goods. Nepal has thus lost out on huge import revenue as goods are coming to Nepal through illegal channels and are easily available in the market.Paras Kharel, executive director of the South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, said overall imports have not been able to rebound in two fiscal years, reflecting the country’s economic slowdown. However, the rise in EV imports contributed to the sudden rise in imports from China.“Imports from Tatopani and Rasuwa customs rose by twice as much,” Kharel said. This shows that imports from China, which were halted after the Covid pandemic, are not gradually improving but are ballooning.According to the Department of Customs, the worth of imports from Tatopani customs increased to Rs37.16 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, compared to Rs11.79 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Similarly, the worth of imports from Rasuwa customs on the northern border increased to Rs55.45 billion in the review period, up from Rs27.25 billion in the same period last fiscal year.

Lama and Singh had earlier revolted from the Communist Party of Nepal to establish their own faction after the party’s fourth convention in 1974. Among Singh’s trusted leaders were Mohan Baidya, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, CP Gajurel and Dev Gurung. But Singh was forced to spend most of the following years politically exiled in India. As a result, Baidya effectively captured the party, renaming it the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN), “Mashal,” pronounced slightly different from Lama’s CPN “Masal.” However, Baidya and many senior party leaders faced self-imposed demotion after the party suffered a strategic setback in the now infamous ‘Sector Scandal’. Baidya was forced to nominate Dahal as the party leader in 1989, a position Dahal has held for three and a half decades.During the first two decades of his leadership, Dahal reigned supreme, as his party led the country into a decade-long violent political conflict that claimed, by some estimates, over 16,000 lives. Despite substantial economic and political costs, the conflict accelerated Nepal’s transition from a semi-feudal society with an exclusive political system into a more inclusive and secular republic. To that end, the Dahal-led Maoist party received due recognition through a popular mandate of the 2008 first Constituent Assembly elections. But Dahal’s unnecessary distrust of Nepal’s more established political parties, which had played a considerable role in bringing his party back into the political mainstream, made him commit blunders and unseated him from a comfortable majority government. His suspicion against fellow comrades who questioned his leadership style and decisions led to multiple splintering of the Maoist party. An insecure leaderDespite leading the country in and out of a transformative political conflict and becoming one of the key signatories of the new constitution, Dahal has remained an insecure leader who takes every opportunity to remind the Nepali people and the world about his “revolutionary contributions”. Possibly, this deep-seated insecurity emerges from the fact that he is neither seen as an intellectually gifted politician like his fellow comrade Baburam Bhattarai, who is known as an ideologue of the Maoist conflict or as a leader with integrity and simplicity like that of his political gurus Singh and Baidya. The thought of losing the political legacy of the ‘People’s War’ despite clinging onto the leadership of the party must constantly haunt the Maoist supremo.Dahal’s insecurity and political hypocrisy were also palpable in the way he derided the Madhesh Movement, which also raised the agendas of federalism and inclusion. Instead of considering them allies, Dahal ordered his party cadres to attack the Madheshi party leaders and their cadres. A large part of the political onus of escalating the tensions leading to the unfortunate Gaur massacre in 2007 will always rest on Dahal. Over the past decade and a half, Dahal has repeatedly failed to display the leadership he is ironically fond of discussing. Despite mobilising thousands of Tharu youths during the conflict, he failed to support their genuine claims on provincial boundaries during the federal structuring. And despite claims of his ‘one-sided love’ for Madhesh, he remained silent as more than 50 Madhesi protesters were indiscriminately killed by the security forces in 2015. Unreliable coalition partnerThere was a time when Dahal led a party that had shaken the country’s political core. Less than two decades later, he now leads a party that has mostly eroded its political base and only relies on a stronger coalition partner to remain relevant. But has Dahal even proved to be a reliable coalition partner? Let’s take a closer look. After Baidya split the party in 2012, the CPN-Maoist was reduced to the third position in the second Constituent Assembly elections, a significant loss from its commanding majority in the first CA. In the following two years, Dahal’s party was not only kept out of power but also forced to endorse a constitution that the Nepali Congress and rival communist party CPN-UML tabled. Having lost the capacity to dictate the political course, Dahal resorted to coalition politics. When the opportunity came, he supported UML’s Khadga Prasad Oli to cobble up a coalition government in October 2015. However, when the Nepali Congress offered him to lead a new coalition, he abandoned Oli and became Prime Minister in 2016. With the 2017 elections on the horizon, Dahal knew his party would not be able to compete with the larger parties that had successfully led the constitution drafting. With some active external mediation, Dahal persuaded Oli for an electoral alliance and even agreed to an eventual unification of the communist forces. When the left unity won a landslide victory, Dahal was convinced that Oli would honour the agreement to hand over power to him mid-way through the four-year period. When Oli refused, he split the united CPN in 2020, convincing several disgruntled leaders like Madhav Nepal to abandon the party and join a coalition with the Nepali Congress. The new coalition also offered Dahal and his party a comfortable division of electoral seats in the 2022 local, provincial and federal elections. But soon after the elections were over, Dahal bargained for power with both Deuba and Oli. Despite having won only 32 seats in the federal parliament with only 11 percent popular vote, Dahal managed to become Nepal’s 33rd Prime Minister in December 2022.Impending downfallIn 2014, political analyst CK Lal had told me that Dahal’s political opportunism would make him relevant in Nepali politics for at least another decade. The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML took exactly a decade to realise that Dahal had been cashing in on Nepal’s fractured politics. This week, the two parties agreed that Nepal’s long-term political stability requires an introspection into the present electoral system, which allows electorally less popular outfits to dictate the course of national politics. So, not only have the two large parties decided to pull the plug on the Dahal government, but they also agreed to form an independent commission to study and propose amendments to the current electoral provision.While there is little disagreement that the current electoral system paved the way for more representation of the hitherto marginalised sections, the opportunity to correct inefficacies like expensive election campaigning and manipulation of the proportional candidacy lists by the parties must not be dismissed either. There are also serious doubts about the intention of the two parties to strike a deal at a time when the Nepal Police and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority are investigating some high-profile corruption cases. It is up to the two parties to vindicate their intent by ensuring that the new political course does not interfere in these investigations. And even if the two parties agree to amend the constitutional provisions regarding elections, they will need to gather a national consensus or at least a two-thirds majority. Whatever happens in the next few weeks and months, it is evidently clear Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s eventual political downfall is on the horizon.

But Dahal’s unnecessary distrust of Nepal’s more established political parties, which had played a considerable role in bringing his party back into the political mainstream, made him commit blunders and unseated him from a comfortable majority government. His suspicion against fellow comrades who questioned his leadership style and decisions led to multiple splintering of the Maoist party. An insecure leaderDespite leading the country in and out of a transformative political conflict and becoming one of the key signatories of the new constitution, Dahal has remained an insecure leader who takes every opportunity to remind the Nepali people and the world about his “revolutionary contributions”. Possibly, this deep-seated insecurity emerges from the fact that he is neither seen as an intellectually gifted politician like his fellow comrade Baburam Bhattarai, who is known as an ideologue of the Maoist conflict or as a leader with integrity and simplicity like that of his political gurus Singh and Baidya. The thought of losing the political legacy of the ‘People’s War’ despite clinging onto the leadership of the party must constantly haunt the Maoist supremo.Dahal’s insecurity and political hypocrisy were also palpable in the way he derided the Madhesh Movement, which also raised the agendas of federalism and inclusion. Instead of considering them allies, Dahal ordered his party cadres to attack the Madheshi party leaders and their cadres. A large part of the political onus of escalating the tensions leading to the unfortunate Gaur massacre in 2007 will always rest on Dahal. Over the past decade and a half, Dahal has repeatedly failed to display the leadership he is ironically fond of discussing. Despite mobilising thousands of Tharu youths during the conflict, he failed to support their genuine claims on provincial boundaries during the federal structuring. And despite claims of his ‘one-sided love’ for Madhesh, he remained silent as more than 50 Madhesi protesters were indiscriminately killed by the security forces in 2015. Unreliable coalition partnerThere was a time when Dahal led a party that had shaken the country’s political core. Less than two decades later, he now leads a party that has mostly eroded its political base and only relies on a stronger coalition partner to remain relevant. But has Dahal even proved to be a reliable coalition partner? Let’s take a closer look. After Baidya split the party in 2012, the CPN-Maoist was reduced to the third position in the second Constituent Assembly elections, a significant loss from its commanding majority in the first CA. In the following two years, Dahal’s party was not only kept out of power but also forced to endorse a constitution that the Nepali Congress and rival communist party CPN-UML tabled. Having lost the capacity to dictate the political course, Dahal resorted to coalition politics. When the opportunity came, he supported UML’s Khadga Prasad Oli to cobble up a coalition government in October 2015. However, when the Nepali Congress offered him to lead a new coalition, he abandoned Oli and became Prime Minister in 2016. With the 2017 elections on the horizon, Dahal knew his party would not be able to compete with the larger parties that had successfully led the constitution drafting. With some active external mediation, Dahal persuaded Oli for an electoral alliance and even agreed to an eventual unification of the communist forces. When the left unity won a landslide victory, Dahal was convinced that Oli would honour the agreement to hand over power to him mid-way through the four-year period. When Oli refused, he split the united CPN in 2020, convincing several disgruntled leaders like Madhav Nepal to abandon the party and join a coalition with the Nepali Congress. The new coalition also offered Dahal and his party a comfortable division of electoral seats in the 2022 local, provincial and federal elections. But soon after the elections were over, Dahal bargained for power with both Deuba and Oli. Despite having won only 32 seats in the federal parliament with only 11 percent popular vote, Dahal managed to become Nepal’s 33rd Prime Minister in December 2022.Impending downfallIn 2014, political analyst CK Lal had told me that Dahal’s political opportunism would make him relevant in Nepali politics for at least another decade. The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML took exactly a decade to realise that Dahal had been cashing in on Nepal’s fractured politics. This week, the two parties agreed that Nepal’s long-term political stability requires an introspection into the present electoral system, which allows electorally less popular outfits to dictate the course of national politics. So, not only have the two large parties decided to pull the plug on the Dahal government, but they also agreed to form an independent commission to study and propose amendments to the current electoral provision.While there is little disagreement that the current electoral system paved the way for more representation of the hitherto marginalised sections, the opportunity to correct inefficacies like expensive election campaigning and manipulation of the proportional candidacy lists by the parties must not be dismissed either. There are also serious doubts about the intention of the two parties to strike a deal at a time when the Nepal Police and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority are investigating some high-profile corruption cases. It is up to the two parties to vindicate their intent by ensuring that the new political course does not interfere in these investigations. And even if the two parties agree to amend the constitutional provisions regarding elections, they will need to gather a national consensus or at least a two-thirds majority. Whatever happens in the next few weeks and months, it is evidently clear Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s eventual political downfall is on the horizon.

Nepal is set to elect the new prime minister next week. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is almost certain to fail the trust vote. This will be his fifth trust vote in a year and a half. The CPN-UML withdrew its support to the government on July 3 after it ditched its coalition with the CPN (Maoist Centre) and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new government.This is the fourth time in Nepal’s political history that two major parties are forming a government without a powerful opposition, which observers say weakens democracy's effective functioning.On Tuesday, the IMF completed the fourth review under its four‑year extended credit facility, allowing Nepal to withdraw $41.3 million to help the country's economic recovery.This brings total disbursements under the extended credit facility for budget support to $247.7 million.The IMF executive board approved the extended credit facility arrangement for Nepal on January 12, 2022. The approved amount totals $371.6 million, which is 180 percent of Nepal’s special drawing rights quota (SDR) of 282.42 million.“Nepal’s economy continues to face challenges,” said the statement issued by the IMF on Thursday. It said that Nepal’s growth projected at 3 percent in the fiscal year 2023-24 remains below potential due to subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs. The IMF has talked about Nepal’s cooperatives sector for the first time.In the statement, the IMF warned about the intensification of financial sector vulnerabilities, such as a further rise in non-performing loans. In this context, “more failures of cooperative lenders could endanger the banking system's soundness,” the IMF said.According to experts and bankers interviewed by the Post, cooperatives, which the government once embraced as one of the three pillars of the economy, are now threatening the economy.In Nepal, millions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are heavily involved in cooperatives, and their failure could not only damage the fragile economy, but also harm social harmony, say experts. Cooperatives are involved in sectors ranging from dairy and livestock to tailoring and retail.Recently, thousands of victims of cooperatives fraud have staged protests in various parts of the country, demanding the return of deposits embezzled by cooperative operators. Hundreds of such depositors came to Kathmandu and staged protests. The government recently signed an agreement with them, promising to solve their problems as soon as possible.“The problem in the cooperative sector will shake up the banking sector. But if there is a wise move, the banking sector can absorb the shock,” said Upendra Poudyal, president of the Confederation of Banks and Financial Institutions Nepal. He said that the regulation of cooperatives has already been delayed. “We have seen that cooperatives are being operated for personal gains. A limited number of people took the benefit.” “Now, the central bank should begin with a single threshold. Limit the number and start supervision.” As of mid-March, there are 31,450 cooperatives in Nepal, with 7.38 million members. The deposit mobilisation in cooperatives amounted to Rs478 billion, while credit mobilisation stood at Rs405 billion. They currently employ 94,000 people.In a recent interview, Kashi Raj Dahal, immediate past chairman of the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee, a government agency, told the Post that globally, most cooperatives work in productive sectors like food production, dairy, fruits and other agricultural activities. “But in Nepal, around 25,000 cooperatives are involved only in financial activities, mainly collecting deposits and issuing loans. Such cooperatives are now in crisis. Over 15,000 are registered to collect deposits. Even others registered as multi-purpose cooperatives primarily engage in savings and credits. Around 500 cooperatives are currently in trouble.”The Dahal-led government has promised the return of at least Rs500,000 to each depositor by recovering it from the directors' assets. Yet doubts persist about whether depositors will get back their money. Some economists have warned about potential mass protests if the cooperatives issue is not taken seriously.The IMF has also warned that the failure to raise the execution rate of large-scale projects would deprive the economy of much-needed stimulus and weigh on growth. On the pessimistic side, the IMF said that economic activity is expected to increase, reaching 4.9 percent in 2024-25, supported by more robust domestic demand. The statement reads that the cautiously accommodative monetary policy stance, the planned increase in capital expenditures in the 2024-25 budget, additional hydropower generation, and a continued rise in tourist arrivals are expected to boost domestic demand and growth. Inflation is expected to remain within the Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) target ceiling of 5.5 percent.“Nepal has made important strides on its economic reform agenda. Decisive actions in monetary policy, bank regulation and rolling off Covid support policies played a major role in overcoming urgent balance of payments pressure in 2021-22,” said Bo Li, deputy managing director of IMF. “Reserves continue to rise without the need to use distortive import restrictions. Despite revenue shortfalls, fiscal discipline was maintained in 2022-23 and 2023-24. Bank supervision and regulation have improved by rolling out new supervisory information systems. Nepal’s medium-term outlook remains favourable as strategic investments in infrastructure, especially in the energy sector, are expected to support potential growth.”The IMF said that strengthening public investment management would support the needed boost to capital spending. Enhancing fiscal transparency will help contain fiscal risks and strengthen medium-term fiscal sustainability.“As monetary policy transmission is still weak in a context of balance sheet repair, a cautious and data-dependent monetary policy remains appropriate to preserve price and external stability,” the IMF said.  ","summary":"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Nepal’s economy, still reeling from subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs, may face an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook, mainly due to fragile political stability and cooperatives failure.The global lender, which provides policy advice and financing to its members to foster growth and financial stability, said Nepal’s fragile political stability could disrupt policy continuity and reform implementation.

We have more information, facts and evidence now than in the past, so there is no need to bicker over which boundary pillar was where,” Rana told reporters after assuming the office of foreign minister. “The facts are there, so we can resolve all our border issues,” she said. “As per my briefing, the Mahakali serves as a border river, and both countries [Nepal and India] have access to it, so there is always a dispute.” “This is a transboundary issue, which we must clearly understand. Hopefully, something will happen in our lifetime. Resolution to the problem will be found on the basis of geography, history and GPS. There’s no magic solution.

The legacy must be upheld for generations to come.” Rana also stated that she plans to focus on executing economic diplomacy and implementing international treaties, agreements and commitments.

President Ramchandra Paudel administered the oath of office and secrecy to Prime Minister Oli. President Paudel on Sunday had appointed Oli as the prime minister under Article 76 (2) of the constitution as there were no other claimants for the post. After CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the immediate past prime minister, was unable to secure the trust of the House of Representatives during a floor test on Friday, President Paudel had invited political parties to form a new government under Article 76 (2) of the constitution on the same evening, setting a Sunday deadline for submitting claims at the President’s Office.With no other contender, Oli had in his support submitted the signatures of 166 lawmakers (Nepali Congress’ 88 and UML’s 78). The minimum number needed to form a government is 138 in the 275-strong House of Representatives.Soon after the swearing-in ceremony on Monday, Prime Minister Oli formed a full 22-member Cabinet, including two deputy prime ministers. Among the 22 members including the prime minister, 10 are from the Congress, while nine represent the UML. The other parties in the Cabinet are the Janata Samajabadi Party (JSP), led by Ashok Rai, and Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP), which have two and one ministries, respectively. Shortly after Oli’s swearing-in, President Paudel also administered the oath of office and secrecy to the newly appointed ministers. Based on Article 76 (9) of the constitution, President Paudel, on the recommendation of the prime minister, administered the oath of office and secrecy to the ministers.Article 76 (9) stipulates that the President shall, on the recommendation of the prime minister, constitute the Council of Ministers comprising a maximum of 25 ministers, including the prime minister, in accordance with the inclusive principle from among the members of federal Parliament.Despite the Article based on which the prime minister recommended the ministers clearly stating that the council of ministers should be in line with the inclusive principle, that is not the case.In the 25-member council of ministers, Prime Minister Oli can still appoint three ministers.“The prime minister still can appoint three full Cabinet ministers or ministers of state to fulfil the requirement enshrined by the constitution for the council of ministers,” Purnaman Shakya, a professor of constitutional law, told the Post. “But ministers of state can only participate in Cabinet meetings in the absence of their line ministers.”In Monday’s Cabinet, Prakash Man Singh of the Congress and Bishnu Prasad Paudel of the UML were inducted as deputy prime ministers. They will also head the Ministry of Urban Development and the Ministry of Finance, respectively.In the 22-member Cabinet formed under Oli’s leadership, there are only two women. There is no representation from the Dalit and Muslim communities.In the 22-member Cabinet, 13 are from the Khas Arya community, and there are three members from Janajati and five from Madheshi communities.Nepal has incorporated proportional representation and inclusion as integral parts of the constitution. This was done to prevent the overrepresentation of one community at the policy-making level. But the country has failed to abide by its charter.“What an irony! Not a single Dalit get a berth in the new Cabinet formed by the so-called champions of inclusive democracy,” Lokraj Baral, a professor of political science, wrote on social media.Likewise, Bhimarjun Acharya, a constitutional expert, also questioned the new Cabinet's inclusiveness.“Everyone did a lot of politics in the name of Dalits, and the communists even more so. Dalits were not given any place in yesterday’s government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal nor in today’s government led by Oli,” Acharya wrote on social media. “I request that Dalits be represented in the Council of Ministers immediately.” When the Post questioned Dalit members of the Congress and the UML parties, they said they were not the right people to comment on the issue.As per the National Population and Housing Census 2021, 13.2 percent of the national population are Dalits while Muslims comprise 4.86 percent of the population.Yet Dalit activists find fault with this silent approach. It is precisely because the Dalit politicians do not strongly raise the issue of their inclusion that this trend prevails, they say.“There are a few other reasons why Dalits are sidelined from mainstream politics. One is because of a weakened Dalit movement,” Purna Darnal, a Dalit activist, told the Post. “When the Maoist Centre, a political party that championed inclusiveness in Nepali politics, refused to be inclusive in the Cabinet formed in their leadership, why would other parties do so?”Darnal added that it is a matter of shame that the two biggest parties in the country practice such blatant exclusion while choosing ministers.Nine of the 10 ministers from the Congress are male.

The situation had been more difficult due to India’s blockade. A few months into Oli’s tenure, the southern neighbour withdrew its blockade while the constitution was amended to address the concerns of the agitating communities. Though the Madhesh-based parties boycotted voting on the constitution amendment, it had partially addressed the concerns of the dissenting groups. His government also signed a historic Trade and Transit Agreement with China, ending Nepal’s sole dependence on India for third-country trade.Oli’s nationalist graph as prime minister for 10 months between October 2015 to August 2016 went up so high that his CPN-UML not only emerged the largest party from the 2017 election but was very close to the majority mark on its own. When Oli moved into Baluwatar for the second time in February 2018, he had an even stronger electoral mandate. After a merger with the CPN (Maoist Centre) two months later, the Nepal Communist Party that he jointly led with Pushpa Kamal Dahal enjoyed a near two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives. Oli’s prime ministership started with high hopes and excitement as he was leading a majority government for the first time in around two decades. As Oli was set to lead the government for a full five-year term, the hope was that decades of political instability would end, the constitution would be implemented and the federal system strengthened. The expectations, however, were short-lived. Oli started demonstrating his authoritarian streak right after taking charge as the executive head. He brought the National Intelligence Department, the Department of Revenue Investigation and the Department of Money Laundering under the purview of the Prime Minister’s Office.His intolerance for dissent became apparent when he banned protests at Maitighar, near Singha Durbar, the government’s seat. His government then prepared a slew of bills aiming to muzzle the media, curtail freedom of expression and shrink civic space. He had contested the elections by selling big dreams—railway connecting China, Nepal’s own ship in the high seas, and distribution of gas through pipelines, among other things. But none of these dreams even came close to fruition. Having realised he had failed to deliver as promised even two years after coming to power, he played another nationalist card—amending the constitution to show Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura in Nepal’s map—which his predecessors never dared to do. While it has been registered as a historic move in the country, it antagonised New Delhi.Oli’s unilateral style of running government and leading the party forced Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal to ally against him, leading to a split in the Nepal Communist Party. After failing to keep the NCP united, Oli tried to dissolve the House—twice in under six months.His decision to trample on the constitution to stay in led to his humiliating exit from the government. He was ousted by the Supreme Court. Political analysts say Oli has a historic opportunity to right the previous wrongs. “The Congress-UML alliance has generated high hopes and provides an opportunity for Oli to correct his past mistakes,” Uddhab Pyakurel, who teaches political sociology at Kathmandu University, told the Post. “However, Oli’s recent statements [on House dissolution] show he is still not in the mood for course correction.

Officials said the move aims to ensure smooth transfer of waste as roads to the landfill often become impassable during the monsoon, preventing the passage of garbage trucks.“We have deployed three excavators, two bulldozers and two loaders to clear landslide debris along the road to the Bancharedanda landfill,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. “Also, we have kept five more vehicles on standby for immediate deployment if needed.”Every year, during monsoon season, the road to landfill sites gets obstructed in multiple places, obstructing the transfer of house waste collected in the three districts of the capital city—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Apart from these, some local levels of Kavrepalanchok also discard garbage at the landfill site at Bancharedanda.The metropolis officials said that they had purchased 10 high-pressure pumps to drain floodwaters from inundated settlements.“Five pumps have already been sent to the high-risk areas along riversides,” said Shrestha. “These can quickly pump away floodwaters.”The city office started repairing the Sisdole road leading to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district just a few weeks before the start of the monsoon. Officials said Rs30 million had been allocated for repairs, which included fixing potholes, concreting roads, and other works.Around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised, according to officials.Besides monsoon-induced road obstructions, garbage disposal is sometimes disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions cause weeks-long halt to door-to-door garbage collection, leading people in the Valley to discard their trash on streets.Officials said that a high-pressure pump is being used to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground.Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The City office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.The city office recently sold non-degradable waste worth Rs700,000.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled.

Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.“Every Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,” said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. “Decisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.

Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.

The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Due to the lack of doctors at our urban health promotion centres, patients suffering from mental health problems have been deprived of timely treatment,” said Nali Bajracharya, a senior public health officer at the department. “Now patients having mental health issues and seeking care at our health centres will also get mental health treatment.”Though neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that a lot of people could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems—anxiety, depression and others.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Health workers say that many city dwellers, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results.

This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide.

Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu.

Nutritionists say this is not good news for consumers hit by inflation who tend to cut budgets for healthy diets due to low income.When eggs become expensive, it affects consumers in all brackets—from restaurants to bakeries and from canteens to households.In Nepal, millions of consumers rely heavily on eggs to meet their protein intake due to expensive meat.According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), humble eggs offer a practical and impactful opportunity to tackle problems related to undernutrition.Eggs are almost pure protein of very high quality. They also provide the entire Adequate Intake of vitamin B12 and choline for young children. The essential fatty acid content of eggs may be necessary in pregnancy. Eggs are popular in many countries and are available at affordable prices.“Most Nepalis have folic acid deficiency. The egg is one of the good sources of folate, including protein and vitamins, and is easy for people of any age to digest,” said Dr Sudhashree Adhikari, a nutritionist. “With a price hike, the egg will be out of reach for many people, which might cause protein deficiency. An egg fulfils around 10 grams of protein intake.”Growing children, including pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, need more protein for growth and development. “The lack of protein hinders the growth and development of children, including muscle growth,” Adhikari said.A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B12, Vitamin B2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc. Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. The antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is essential for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps the baby’s brain development.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs daily without hesitation. A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs,” Dr Atul Upadhyay, another nutritionist, told the Post in a recent interview.Recently, the retail price of eggs increased twice a month as the Nepal Layers Poultry Association hiked the farmer price, ultimately increasing the retail price.Binod Poharel, president of Nepal Layers Poultry Association, said the retail price of an egg is Rs22.50 now. Pokharel said that the price of eggs was increased as farmers could not recover the production cost for a long time due to the rise in feed prices. The farm gate price of an egg ranges from Rs14-16 per piece, but due to the multiple layers of middlemen, it becomes expensive when it reaches the consumer’s hand, traders said.FAO, the specialised agency of the United Nations that leads international efforts to defeat hunger, has set the per capita per year requirement of eggs in developing countries at 48 units. A person's requirement for meat, a source of protein, is 14 kg per year, while the requirement for milk is 91 litres.According to data from Nepal’s agriculture ministry, a Nepali eats 18.1 kg of meat and 61 eggs annually, well above the benchmark set by the UN body. The consumption of milk currently stands at 79 litres, still short by 12 litres.Per capita meat consumption was 9.8 kg per year in 2008 and 9.7 kg in 2000.Adhikari said that eggs are cheap and easy-to-find food that fulfils protein and vitamin needs better than plant-based proteins, different varieties of legumes, meat, and fish.Adhikari said the government needs to provide relief on such food products so that many people can access them. “When there is food inflation, and people’s incomes are not increasing, they will reduce their consumption.”According to the association, egg production this summer has declined to 2.5 million units daily from 6 million in 2023.“There is a gap between demand and supply as production gets hit in the summer season,” said Pokharel. “Also, many poultry farmers are leaving the industry after their businesses were hit badly by the Covid pandemic followed by high bank interest rates.”Consumer rights activists said traders hiked the price of eggs on the pretext that farmers kept a good profit margin for themselves. Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum, said poultry farmers do not benefit from the hiked price, as all the money goes into the pockets of traders or middlemen.Medium egg, which used to cost Rs430 per crate (30 pieces), now costs Rs530, a hike of Rs100 in a month.“This is not a justifiable hike. Traders are profiteering from it, not the farmers,” said Maharjan.Maharjan said that, earlier, two organisations fixed the price of eggs—the Egg Producers Association and the Nepal Layers Association. The price used to be competitive. “But now both organisations have merged. There is a monopoly,” he said, according to the Consumer Protection Act, 2018. The rise in egg prices is a big blow for consumers who have seen vegetable prices double and triple due to the monsoon disasters, which have affected output and cut the supply chain.

Paddy yield was high due to the soil rich in nutrients and easy availability of irrigation. The family was also able to sell the grains after storing the year’s need for consumption. “I purchased two more bighas,” Shrestha said.Hundreds of families, particularly those in the hills, migrated to Chitwan in the 1970s and 1980s, in search of fertile lands. However, the situation is different now. Shrestha still owns land in Ameliya, but does not cultivate it. Locals are leaving the villages of Ameliya, adjoining the Chitwan National Park, Nepal’s first wildlife sanctuary. As the village gradually began emptying, paddy transplantation has also stopped.“Now, we buy rice to eat,” Shrestha said.Purnamaya Adhikari of Jiwanpur, Khaireni Municipality Ward 10, has been growing paddy on a bigha and a half. She has not switched to other crops but has seen banana plants grow on her neighbours' fields.“Many farmers have switched to banana. Paddy is least preferred,” Adhikari said.Chitwan has seen farmers switching to cash crops as the income from paddy is low.Statistics at the Agriculture Development Office, Chitwan show that paddy plantation area is shrinking fast.In the key season, the monsoon, farmers produce paddy on 22,000 hectares, down from 31,000 hectares two decades ago. The office record shows that paddy production peaked in 2002–03 when the Maoist insurgency compelled people to rush to the Tarai.Indra Dhungana, chief of the Project Implementation Unit, Bharatpur, under the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernisation Project, said there are no specific studies, but paddy cultivation in Chitwan is declining. “It’s because Chitwan has grown into a residential area, with land being plotted for housing.”The paddy fields in Chitwan have been filled with concrete houses in just 20 years. Besides, farmers have started searching for alternative sources of income. As commercial banana and vegetable farming and fisheries expand, paddy fields are vanishing, Dhungana said.Umraj Aryal, an official at the Agriculture Development Office, Chitwan, said the commercial vegetable farming trend is steady. “Nowadays, capsicum farming is growing in east Chitwan,” he said. “As the capsicum is sowed in early September, transplanting paddy [in the summer] is impossible.”Residential area has increased in Bharatpur wards 11 and 12. Around 20 years ago, those areas mostly remained filled with paddy, Aryal said. The Padampur area inside the national park, known for high paddy yield, has been shifted to Barandabhar forest south of the highway. In the new Padampur, banana and vegetable farming is thriving.Satya Narayan Chaudhary of Ratnanagar, Bichauli, does not believe that the paddy acreage has declined. “People have stopped farming.”As farmhands are not readily available, there has been a growing use of machines, he said.“Farmers are switching to other crops,” he said, admitting that land development for housing has increased. “It’s a serious issue.”According to statistics, vegetable farming and fisheries in Chitwan covered 2,132 hectares and 68 hectares during 1998-99.Vegetable farming has currently expanded to 6,503 hectares. However, since vegetable farming depends on the cropping cycle, it does not create a huge gap in the paddy production area, Chaudhary said.Paddy transplantation, however, cannot be done in fields used for commercial Banana farming and fisheries.Banana fields in Chitwan cover 2,200 hectares, while fish ponds have expanded to 800 hectares.“With the decline in paddy production, hay output has also fallen. Straw is a huge source of animal feed. Along with rice, Chitwan now imports straw too,” said Jhalak Nath Kandel, chief of the Agriculture Development Office.He said that the rice deficit in Nepal currently stands at 581,505 tonnes. “It’s a serious issue if paddy plantation areas decline. The country’s food import bill has ballooned.”Summer production has declined by a fourth, but there has been some growth in spring paddy areas and output. In the fiscal year 2002-23, spring paddy was transplanted on 3,750 hectares, which increased to 5,540 hectares in 2022-23. This fiscal year, spring paddy is growing on 7,000 hectares. “Demand for spring paddy is rising. A kind of cash crop, its farming is increasing,” said Nirmal Poudel, an agri economist at the Agriculture Development Office, Chitwan.Agriculture technicians say spring paddy is less prone to diseases. As it is produced in a season with little rainfall, it is largely unaffected by pests. This pushes the yield up. The summer paddy productivity stands at 4.4 tonnes per hectare while spring paddy output is 5.6 tonnes. According to Dhungana, farmers harvested 6.4 tonnes of spring paddy a hectare this spring.Due to farm mechanisation and improved irrigation, summer paddy also sees better harvest now.

Industry insiders attribute this to the appreciation of the US dollar.The central bank said that the country earned Rs76.55 billion from tourism in the review period, surpassing the record set in 2018-19 when the country had earned Rs75.37 billion from 1.2 million foreign tourists. (At that time, the exchange rate was $1=Rs112.9.)According to a central bank report, Nepal received 1.06 million tourists in the first 11 months.“The surge in tourism income is primarily a result of the exchange rate,” said Deepak Raj Joshi, former CEO of Nepal Tourism Board. Any adjustments in the exchange rate will prompt an appreciation or depreciation of the tourist’s currency, affecting transport costs and the tourist’s decisions to visit the country. “Thus, the exchange rate impacts the number of tourist visits and tourism receipts,” said Joshi.“Besides, the growth of international chain hotels and Nepal gradually switching to a digital payment system has also contributed to the growth in tourism income.”The tourism ministry’s statistics show that the average stay of tourists in Nepal is currently 13.2 days, while they spend $41 per day.Gunakar Bhatta, spokesperson for the Nepal Rastra Bank, said the depreciated exchange rate positively relates to the tourism demand, as travel becomes less expensive when visiting a devalued country. “The currency factor, normally, forces tourists to select a destination before a trip. In this context, a country with a depreciation in domestic currency will attract international tourists,” said Bhatta. He said that while most of Nepal’s economic indicators have been underperforming, tourism has been doing exceptionally well.While Nepal’s economy is anticipated to grow by 3.87 percent in the current fiscal year, accommodation and food service, which are linked to tourism activities, are expected to see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among all 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy.“This shows how the tourism industry has been a boon for Nepal’s sluggish economic growth.”The digital payment system has also been making tourism income transparent. Paras Kunwar, chief operating officer of Fonepay, said Indian tourists have been spending Rs5 million a day since Nepal started the payment system through the quick response (QR) code on March 1.“Since the central bank has fully opened the digital retail payment gateway for Nepali operators with any other country, it will help bring more foreign currencies.”Through the budget, the government has announced that it will draw 1.6 million foreign visitors this year.According to industry insiders, the target is attainable, but there are a few challenges.From November 8, Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport will be closed for 10 hours daily, from 10 pm to 8 am, for five months until March 31, to expand the taxiways.September-November is Nepal’s peak tourist season.Besides, industry insiders say the Nepal Tourism Board has been headless for the past four months, affecting all international promotional and marketing events.A number of reports, including the latest by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said Nepal’s economic activity is expected to pick up, with growth reaching 4.9 percent in the next fiscal year 2024-25. This growth will be supported by an increase in tourist arrivals, boosting domestic demand. According to the Nepal Tourism Board, the country’s tourism promotional body, in 2023, tourist arrivals crossed the million mark for the first time in four years.Foreign arrivals had crossed the one million mark for the first time in 2018 when the country received 1.17 million foreign visitors.The number reached 1.19 million in 2019. Then, the Covid pandemic started in early 2020, bringing arrivals to a standstill. Travel restrictions and an economic slowdown triggered by lockdowns delivered a massive blow to Nepal’s burgeoning tourism industry, decimating revenues and profits after 2020.Nepal received 230,085 and 150,962 tourists in 2020 and 2021, respectively. In 2022, the number shot up to 614,869.Joshi said that by the end of 2024, Nepal may get 1.2 million tourists in the year. “A careful execution of plan and proper marketing, especially in China, could boost arrivals to 1.6 million,” said Joshi. “It will be justified to shift Kathmandu’s airport expansion from November to December, to let the peak season pass.”Dozens of luxury hotels have opened across the country so there are no problems with accommodation, he said. Nepal has been widening roads and building other infrastructure, like airports, which will help attract more tourists. However, industry insiders say the government’s neglect of air safety problems could hinder future growth, particularly in the high-end segment, where travellers consider the safety of any destination country while making travel plans.Most embassies have put Nepal’s air safety situation on their travel advisories. The European Commission imposed this list in 2013 after Nepali airlines failed to meet international safety standards. The government has wilfully ignored the call of the United Nations aviation watchdog, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, to split Nepal’s civil aviation body into two entities: service provider and regulator. The separation is a crucial organisational reform agenda which has been a work in progress for the past one and a half decades.

The procedure includes recognising and responding to emergency situations, seeking help, performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and providing breathing assistance.Chances of survival will be high if trained health workers respond to the cases first. Officials said that the number of patient deaths in emergencies could be reduced significantly if all health workers serving in hospital emergencies were trained with basic life support skills.“We will also encourage provincial governments to provide basic life support skills to health workers serving in provincial hospitals and health centres run by local units,” said Budhathoky. “Those serving in emergencies at private health facilities will also get this training.”Doctors say that basic life support skills can be effective in saving lives when provided promptly and correctly. Health officials say many health workers serving in emergencies of health facilities, especially those hired newly, do not have basic life support skills.Meanwhile, the Nepal Medical Council, the national regulatory body for medical doctors, said it is working to make continuous professional development training mandatory for licence renewal.“Doctors must pass a 100-mark test on ethics, basic life support, communication, infection control and the rational use of medicines,” said Dr Bishwa Raj Dawadi, the council member. “Gone are the days when one would remain a doctor simply by obtaining a medical degree. They must be updated with skills and new knowledge.”A few years ago, the Council made professional development training mandatory for all medical doctors. Failure to attend the course will result in non-renewal of the medical licence.Medical doctors undergo the training regularly, and the council assesses its effectiveness every five years to ensure that doctors providing health care services are updated in their profession.Professional training involves processes that act as refresher courses to update and enhance a doctor’s knowledge, skills, and experience, even after the completion of their formal degree. It can take the form of fellowships, seminars, workshops, conferences, and continuous medical education.The NMC said that CPD (continuous professional development training) is a lifelong process of learning and updating professional skills.Doctors also need to take effective communication skills training so that they can communicate with the families and relatives of patients about their condition and the treatment process, including surgeries. In recent years, there have been reports of scuffles between hospitals/doctors and the kin of patients in the event of a patient’s death. At times, situations have taken a nasty turn in which doctors have been manhandled and hospitals vandalised.The medical council said that implementation of the code of ethics has been a challenge thus far and that training such as the CPD could help in its effective enforcement.

Lightning strikes killed as many as 19 people during this period.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The persistent rainfall that started on Friday not only destroyed houses and inundated settlements but also contaminated drinking water sources.Health officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snake bites—in the coming days.“We have also requested central hospitals and medical colleges to be prepared for help during disease outbreaks,” said Ghimire. “As we don’t have enough doctors and health workers to deploy to control the outbreaks, we have to seek help from big hospitals and medical colleges.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks. “Essential medicines have been stockpiled, health workers have been asked to be ready for deployment to affected areas, anti-snake venom has been supplied to health facilities,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoki, spokesperson at the Health Ministry. “As of Sunday evening, no outbreaks have been reported.”According to health experts, sources of drinking water generally become contaminated in disaster-hit areas, and people displaced by natural disasters become highly vulnerable to infections with waterborne and vector-borne diseases.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result.

","summary":"I can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve ","summary":"Aditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York.

We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve "},{"hash":"4f18229de2a5d8016e8888758de34cc858e98af2b542ed3077fa8ab2d1e49a3b","title":"patience-passion-and-pastries","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/recipes/2024/04/27/patience-passion-and-pastries","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/BakeleusbyCeleus-1714186343.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1714176000000,"source":"kp","category":"recipes","content":"Celeus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar.

It happened to me but could have happened to anyone.”Spain manager Luis de la Fuente added: “I couldn’t be happier. A real team, European champions. I said I was proud and today I am even prouder. It confirms what we are. For me, they are the best in the world.”After a cautious first half where Spain had 65% possession but England’s Phil Foden managed the only shot on target, the Spaniards struck two minutes after the restart, despite losing influential midfielder Rodri to injury at the break.Teenager Lamine Yamal, who had been shackled completely in the first half, finally found space down the right and crossed for Nico Williams to slot home past goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.Spain then enjoyed a purple patch with a series of sharp attacks as England’s previously watertight defence lost its shape and Dani Olmo, Morata and Williams all had good chances.England manager Gareth Southgate sent on Ollie Watkins, the scoring substitute hero of the semi-final, for an ineffective Harry Kane after an hour, with Cole Palmer, England’s most creative player in the last month, joining him 10 minutes later.PAY OFFThe changes paid off almost immediately when Jude Bellingham laid the ball back into Palmer’s path and the substitute curled home a precise low 20-metre shot in the 73rd minute.The massed ranks of England fans, who vastly outnumbered their rivals, exploded and the whole feel of the night changed.But Spain weathered the storm and a lapse of concentration saw England undone as Marc Cucurella was left in space on the left, received the ball from Oyarzabal and drilled it across the box for the substitute to stretch out a toe and poke it home.There was still time for more drama as Spain keeper Unai Simon parried a Declan Rice header from a corner and Dani Olmo then brilliantly headed away Marc Guehi’s follow up on the line.It meant that Spain added a fourth title to those won in 1964, 2008 and 2012 and, as only the third team in the last nine Euros to win the trophy without coming through a shootout at some point in the tournament following France (2000) and Greece (2004), nobody can deny they were worthy winners.For England the “30 years of hurt” after their 1966 World Cup success, which was the soundtrack to their hosting of Euro 96, will now run to at least double that number as they became the first team to lose successive Euro finals“We’ve competed until the very end of the final,” said Southgate, who is widely expected to step down having remarkably led his country to two Euro finals and World Cup semi and quarter-finals in his eight years in charge.“I think we didn’t keep possession of the ball quite well enough. They press you really well and you've got to get out of that pressure and we weren’t able to do that and in the end that meant they had more control of the game“The players have got to take enormous credit for getting us to the point they did. They way they fought and represented the shirt with pride. They were never beaten until the very end, the final five minutes of the last game and then that chance at the end. Just the character and resilience that they’ve shown.“It’s fine margins, but I think they (Spain) were the best team in the tournament and they deserved to win.” ","summary":"Spain capped their dominant Euro 2024 campaign with a 2-1 win over England, securing their fourth title as Mikel Oyarzabal scored the game-winning goal in the 86th minute."},{"hash":"e4e58c06de28ea64dc4e6129e1b86282b3de4b5009178a3ec0846497ebeeb9cf","title":"Israeli airstrikes on Gaza killed at least 13 people, according to Palestinian health officials.","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/world/2024/07/16/israeli-strikes-across-gaza-kill-at-least-13-people-palestinian-health-officials-say","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/world/Untitled3-1721123379.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1721088000000,"source":"kp","category":"world","content":"Israeli forces battled Hamas-led fighters in several areas across Gaza on Tuesday, while Palestinian health officials said at least 13 people were killed in Israeli bombardments in southern and central areas of the enclave.In Rafah, a southern border city where Israeli forces have been operating since May, five Palestinians were killed in an air strike on a house, while in nearby Khan Younis, a man, his wife and two children were killed, they said.In central Gaza in Nuseirat, one of the enclave’s eight historic refugee camps, at least four Palestinians were killed in separate shelling and aerial strikes, medics said.

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.

In a sense, it was an experimentation and training opportunity created for the next generation of sample survey researchers. This, therefore, had obvious caveats on the robustness of its outcomes and usability of inferences.Last month, the National Statistical Office (NSO), the rebaptised CBS, published a report of the fourth edition of the Survey (NLSS-IV) 2023-24. The original objective of the NLSS to “assess the poverty situation” does not seem to have changed. However, in nearly three decades of exercises that published three editions—1996, 2004 and 2011—this government entity seems to have barely learned to conduct such sample-based surveys, improve its inferential credibility, and maintain research integrity while working with a disproportionately small sample of a large population.Unrepresentative samplingNo doubt, sample surveys, as against population surveys, are risky and can provide only indicative inference even if they are implemented with utmost professionalism and high precision research. Otherwise, they suffer from self-selection bias and inferential misrepresentation due to underrepresentation of data variation. Besides, creating a mini sample from an already available population dataset to inquire into the topic that the population sample itself could carry out better is a redundant exercise and a misuse of resources. First, the NLSS rituals on top of the National Census do not add any value to better understanding the country's socioeconomic realities. Second, the authenticity of small-sized sample surveys like the NLLS can be established if, and only if, their statistical outcomes are consistent with those of comprehensive surveys like censuses. The NLSS exercises have failed on both counts.For the NLSS-IV, data was collected from a sample of 9,600 out of 6.761 million households, or 0.14 percent. When it is disaggregated into selected 15 geographical domains, the average number of households surveyed in each domain is only 640. This is certainly a gross underrepresentation to statistically infer anything meaningful. For example, the NLSS-IV claims the proportion of households in Nepal receiving remittance income has reached 76.8 percent. It also argues that it is a dramatic increase from 23.4 percent in 1996 and 56.8 percent in 2011. Nevertheless, it is not only inconsistent with the National Census 2021 data but also does not reflect the actual ground reality. Inferential flawsThe Census 2021 states that the total number of individuals absent from home, possibly to be in a foreign country, is only 2.169 million. It is next to impossible to receive remittances by 5.192 million (76.8 percent of 6.761 million households recognised by the Census) households sent by only 2.169 million migrating individuals, including seasonal absentees. Among them, even if only one individual from each household is considered out of home and remits the earnings back, only 32 percent of the households are likely to receive any kind of remittance. The direct positive correlation between the outmigration of individuals and remittance income can no way be undermined or ruled out.There were similar inconsistencies in NLSS-2011 and Census-2011. The Census stated that the population away from the country then was only 1.921 million, while the NLSS-III claimed that nearly 57 percent of the 5.7 million households benefitted from the remittance receipts. As such, which inferences and conclusions should people believe in and use—the Census or the NLSS, both published by the same agency? There seems to be a great deal of confusion even in defining what essentially constitutes the 'remittance' for the purpose of this report.Even in determining the poverty line and poverty-related indicators—the sole stated objective of the NLSS exercise—both the data and inferences are messy, to say the least. It has adopted a new poverty line using 2022/23 as the base year. The updated line marginally increases the minimum income bar. A Nepali citizen is now classified as poor if her annual per capita total consumption expenditure is less than NRs72,908 annually, or Rs200 (USD 1.5 at 1 USD=NPR 133) per day. The report, at one instance, claims that Nepal has seen a significant reduction in poverty headcount over the last 12 years, from 25.16 percent in 2010-11 to 3.57 percent (vis-a-vis 2011 inflation-adjusted poverty line) in 2022-23. In the next paragraph, it says, “20.27 percent of the population in Nepal lives below the new poverty line”.The definitional relation in practice between the 'headcount' and the 'poverty line' is that the 'national poverty headcount ratio is the percentage of the population living below the national poverty line.' Then how do the claims that poverty declined to 3.57 percent while 20.27 percent of the population still languish below the poverty line by earning only USD 1.5 dollars a day stand together? Regardless of these purely data doctoring or data cooking machinations, the critical question is: Whether the poverty rate actually declined in reality or not.Extrapolations and excusesThese are only a few examples of research by a government agency that is dependent on a small set of data while resources are disproportionately used in clever tabulation and preparation of politically convenient reports to show progress in critical topics like poverty reduction. No research finding should be only a circus of data overexploitation and far-fetched extrapolation like this. Whenever the discrepancies in research outcomes of government agencies are called out, the instant response is to point fingers towards methodological differences or biased perceptions. Also, the “we are the government” mindset runs deep to prove their findings as sacrosanct and beyond question.Nepal is pathetically handicapped in data-based research. There is a clear dearth of institutions in the country, academic or otherwise, that have the technical capacity and financial resources to carry out large-scale, nationwide research to counter the spuriousness of many such government surveys and research outcomes. International development partners, for instance, the World Bank, which has been supporting the NLSS endeavours since the beginning in 1995, have hardly paid any attention to the fact that the effective presence of autonomous research institutions out of government influence can better contribute to national policymaking. A plethora of survey-based research norms and practices, specifically in government-owned agencies, must change now.

I haven’t been able to locate their full report on their site yet, but I find the phrasing for the overall score rather intriguing—Nepali media is vibrant but not as vibrant. Nepal scored 23 out of 40 overall for the four measures: Information quality, channels, consumption and engagement, and transformative action.I checked for how they define the term somewhat vibrant, with a score of 21 to 30, and this is what I found: “Quality information is available in this country and most of it is editorially independent, based on facts, and not intended to harm. There are sufficient resources for content production, but some groups may not be well-represented, and some media may struggle financially. Most people have the rights, means, and capacity to access a wide range of information, although some do not. Most people recognize and reject misinformation, although some do not…”The positive terms above, including international media headlines describing Nepal’s performance as satisfactory, might surprise average media users who generally criticise our media as failures lacking quality and breath. These words also contrast with the negative perception, and, to be precise, they suggest a \"mostly vibrant\" rather than a \"somewhat vibrant\" media environment.Over the years, I have described our media as vibrant, even \"very vibrant\", mainly for their assertiveness and persistence despite many challenges. The USAID-funded study essentially serves as a barometer to guide US development efforts in the country. It comes as a critique highlighting geographic disparity, caste-based leadership and a predominance of political coverage over crucial developmental issues such as inclusion and climate change in our media. What is particularly interesting and valuable about the report is that it integrates perceptions of editors and professionals from across the entire information ecosystem, including news and other forms of media.Quality issueDespite widespread perceptions, instances of Nepali media lapses are sporadic and occur as exceptions rather than the rule. Still, these issues are serious for hard-core journalism, if not for social media sites with varied media ethics or lax professionalism. They serve as a test of the civic significance of news media. At this juncture, journalism and social media alike face the dual challenge of innovating while maintaining the highest level of quality and integrity. News outlets, including traditional ones, have explored innovations in multimedia, podcasting and interactive visuals, but social media platforms lead in innovation. Traditional outlets still prioritise textual storytelling, and some shine in their long-forms and commentaries. Legacy media and online news portals are generally reluctant to innovate substantially, with multimedia efforts often failing to fully realise their potential. They are hindered by the need to \"feed the beast\"—meeting deadlines and sustaining portals with breaking news or live reports without much context.Enhanced diversity in content and inclusive coverage are critical needs. News platforms, generally known for their rigorous and verified reporting, should move beyond their predominant focus on social and political dramas to prioritise in-depth and comprehensive stories. Independent social media creators, known for their emphasis on sensational and controversial content but proficient in live reporting and specialising in niche subjects such as travel or educational vlogging, should strive to provide greater contextual depth. YouTubers and Facebook Live broadcasters have become significant players in our information ecosystem, impacting people’s perception of journalism itself. Podcasting and talk shows are on the rise but often lack the editorial oversight, news values and ethical guidelines necessary to be considered legitimate journalism. While they may exhibit some attributes of journalism—such as news portals, screaming headlines, and emphasis on currency—their authenticity is frequently questioned. Specific content from these sites is often criticised for unverified information, misleading narratives, and even misinformation. This issue, however, is not unique to Nepal.Understanding audience behaviour through ongoing research is also crucial. Are our audiences genuinely segmented, gravitating towards specific content types, or are they merely hopping around different content without much loyalty? Legacy media could attract more audiences through self-help, utility, or explainer journalism, but their mainstay remains news and current affairs.Overall, today, we have more journalism, both quantitatively and qualitatively, than in the past. However, compared to other forms of media content like entertainment, advertisement, publicity, and propaganda, journalism remains a small fraction. Perceptions of trust in media are often shaped by public misunderstanding of journalism's civic role amidst the increasing degradation of information in the digital age. The belief that anyone with digital access can perform journalistic tasks like content creation overlooks the meticulous methods and verification standards true journalists adhere to. In contrast, amateur content creators routinely rely on incomplete information. Nepali media must encourage creativity and uphold professional standards to foster true innovation. Simply focusing on content is insufficient. There is a notable deficiency in professional, technical, and managerial skills, especially in social marketing for engagement. Media outlets should invest in and cultivate dedicated storytelling teams. Training for journalists should go beyond news production to encompass new media skills and technical proficiency in design, engineering, production, audience engagement, verification and fact-checking. Competence in content marketing and management is equally crucial.The most discerning audiences still and often find legacy media more credible than other sources. The real issue lies in legacy media losing paid subscriptions, ad venues, and sponsorships to social media platforms. This shift has resulted in newsrooms being downsized, leaving novice reporters with little investment in innovation and training. The entire industry seems to be in disarray, and the market has lost its self-correcting powers.A systemic approach is required to bounce back, including policy reforms and partnerships with new media platforms. Journalism, as a public interest enterprise, is too precious to be left entirely to the market. The future of Nepali media hinges on its ability to innovate, diversify, and maintain the trust and engagement of its audience.

Over 52 percent of students have been categorised as non-graded. We need to identify and address the causes behind the bad results. I have heard some people blame the letter grading system. This is wrong. A form of letter grading system was already there. We only suggested an upgraded form of the system. If we start blaming the system, we won’t find the real cause of the problem. What may be the real causes that you are hinting at?The first is the poor quality of teachers in our country. A form of letter grading system was there even before. But it had two loopholes. First, the government took an approach whereby all students would pass. That gave an impression to the students that they don’t need to study hard. That degraded the quality of their education. Second, there was a system of giving marks based on the students’ performances in theoretical and practical exams. Of the total 100 marks, the practical exams made up 35 marks. Most students were given maximum marks in the practical exams. That helped them get higher grades even if they didn’t do well in theoretical exams. This system encouraged students to neglect theoretical studies. That has caused huge damage to our education system. The letter grade system introduced this year has closed those loopholes. But the letter grading system requires a learning environment. The system was introduced without adequate preparation for its effective implementation. Also, the Covid pandemic disturbed preparatory works at the time. We should have drastically improved classroom teaching practices, and trained teachers across the country because their teaching methods are outdated. They weren’t trained on the grading system. They give lectures and encourage students to memorise while the letter grading system requires a thorough process and encourages result-oriented learning. It doesn’t prioritise marks. Our teachers and schools lacked the capacity to implement the new system. Teachers weren’t trained and prepared. Even now, most teachers don’t know what the letter grading system is. The system is necessary to make our students compete in global markets.While we upgraded the system, we didn’t upgrade the schools and teachers. Our teachers engage only in routine and formal responsibilities such as completing textbook courses before the examinations. This system should be properly internalised not only by teachers and students but also school management, palikas [local units] and parents of the students. Only then can it be effectively implemented. These are the major reasons behind the poor results. How is the students’ performance evaluated in the letter grading system?First, teachers should study a lot. They take reference of the subject matter from the textbook and teach students giving a broader perspective of the matter. They have to engage the students practically on the issue. The students should be regularly evaluated based on their participation and response in study and activities. The teachers should teach them and constantly monitor whether they are learning and making progress. The marking should be based on that. So, in this system, the examination starts from day 1 and everyday activities contribute to their marks. It also takes other activities such as behaviour, understanding, presentation into consideration. Therefore, it is called a regular assessment system based on a thorough process, unlike the traditional three-hour-long yearly examination method. If the teachers aren’t competent to carry out these activities, this idea can’t yield good results. They badly need capacity enhancement. The pedagogy should be remodelled.What was the rationale behind the decision to implement this system?One reason was to upgrade our education’s standard on par with the international standards and make our students fit for global markets. In the course of formulating this policy, we undertook a comprehensive research of international practices. Based on that evidence-based research, we submitted a report to then education minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. The government studied and endorsed it. Basically, this system was introduced with an objective of upgrading our education system in the changed context. But we lacked preparations to implement this idea.We will make a mistake if we change this system. I heard that the education minister [Sumana Shrestha] decided to make some changes in the policy and allow all non-graded students to sit for chance examinations, whereas the system says only those students who secured non-grades in two subjects can retake exams for the same subjects. There is no point in changing the method to favour even the students who have failed in all the subjects. She should have made it clear what factors made her change the criteria overnight. I cannot understand why the minister made the decision in a haste without considering its impact.In fact, our next step should have been capacity enhancement of teachers. The minister took some right decisions such as separating teachers from political parties. But an incumbent minister changing a system that was implemented by a previous minister would cause a problem. She could have formed a panel to conduct a study to find if the letter grading system is the main cause behind the students’ underperformance. But changing a policy through an order didn’t look good.Results show our students are very poor in mathematics, science and English. What could be the reasons?This is unfortunate. We saw similar trends in previous years as well. Mathematics and science are becoming more challenging. One reason is the lack of sufficient teachers for these subjects. Also, some teachers are under-utilised. Some teachers don’t go to the schools. So special measures need to be taken to manage teachers mainly for these subjects. Otherwise, we will have similar results in the coming years.The committee under your leadership recommended that those getting a GPA below 1.6 have to choose technical courses and those willing to study Grade 11 must score above 1.6 GPA. What was the idea behind that recommendation?The idea was to end the situation of halting students’ study and activities because of their lower grades. We have a government body in the form of the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) which has been offering dozens of vocational training based on the needs and interests of people. So our youths can join a suitable CTEVT course. We need more people in vocational fields. Skilled people aren’t available in the country. A large number of people working in technical fields in Nepal are from India. We included the provision in consultation with CTEVT officials. Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel had also prepared a broad plan to implement the letter grading system and integrate the vocational part in our education system. The present government should improve the education system by enhancing teachers’ capacity and encouraging youths to join vocational training to fill the gaps in the employment market. Are the infrastructure and resources available in our education system sufficient to implement the grading system?Some schools lack even essential resources while in some we find misuse or underuse of resources. So, our education ministry should carry out a comprehensive mapping and find where teachers are required, where they are underutilised and where they are idle. Then, the government can make optimum use of the teachers and make additional investment on need-basis. Such an approach will yield better results. In general, our academic institutions lack resources as there is a trend of allocating insufficient budgets for the education sector. Yes, the letter grading system needs more investment. We have to work on teachers’ capacity enhancement and to provide learning materials to students. When you make an activity participatory, you certainly need resources and investments.Do we need to review our teacher recruitment process and our pedagogy in the universities that produce teachers?The government can consider new requirements while recruiting teachers and train them accordingly. Also, we need to update our curriculum and pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. I have doubts about the quality of our graduates, post-graduates and even PhD holders due to the poor teaching and learning environment of our academic institutions. There is a need for more coordination and collaboration between the government and universities to address such issues.In the end, I want to stress that the government should adopt a clear and consistent policy and avoid ad-hoc decisions. The letter grading system is the best and we should push for that despite the challenges in its implementation. Just that it should have been enforced after enhancing teachers’ capacity. The problems we have now are due to lack of preparation. ","summary":"In the Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) conducted this year, over 52 percent of students failed to graduate to grade 11.

What are the takeaways of the prime minister’s Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government’s decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country’s foreign policy doesn’t change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government’s priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn’t it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn’t affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country’s ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person’s affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn’t seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister’s New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister’s visit doesn’t reflect any misgivings about the government’s decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn’t reflect that. Why aren’t we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country’s views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don’t see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats’ relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don’t get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country’s influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let’s move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister’s level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister’s emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal’s official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister’s Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report’s submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India’s facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour’s support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India’s infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal’s electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven’t developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don’t envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn’t the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects—domestic as well as international use—of the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It’s been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why haven’t we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon. ","summary":"Nepal's government has recalled its ambassadors to 11 countries, sparking debate and controversy; the prime minister's recent visit to India focused on resolving outstanding issues, expediting trade agreements, and addressing border disputes; while progress has been made in implementing the trade and transit agreement with China, BRI projects face challenges, and the feasibility study for the Keirung-Kathmandu railway project is nearing completion."},{"hash":"39c44d610af67ba08ff049a5b8f2e1a1e4fa2e7d8f27b94ab1eff69c3dcd2555","title":"national-id-number-is-sufficient-you-don-t-need-a-hard-copy","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/06/16/national-id-number-is-sufficient-you-don-t-need-a-hard-copy","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2019/default/WhatsAppImage20240616at195726-1718587151.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1718496000000,"source":"kp","category":"interviews","content":"The government has decided to make the National ID Card mandatory in order to receive services from government and public institutions. In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let’s begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card–National ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‘no, I have a National ID card’. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don’t ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don’t accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn’t help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal’s total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don’t need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn’t misused and it doesn’t make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don’t need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can’t be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‘terrorised people’ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive’s completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven’t contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities’ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn’t need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors—banking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don’t register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn’t misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn’t misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security—L1, L2, L3—to ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded. ","summary":"The government has decided to make the National ID Card mandatory in order to receive services from government and public institutions. In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let’s begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature.
