However, recent trends and changing times have raised concerns about the future of this unique cultural heritage. A compelling Documentary by The North Face titled \"The Last Honey Hunters\" sheds light on the dwindling tradition and highlights the fears that it might soon vanish with the passing of time. You can watch the video here.The Vanishing Honey Hunting Tradition\nFor centuries, honey hunting has been more than just a means of obtaining honey for these mountain communities; it has been a rite of passage and a vital part of their identity. This traditional practice, deeply rooted in the Gurung and Tamang communities, involves scaling steep cliffs to collect honey from the hives of giant honeybees, producing the sought-after mad honey—a rare and potent substance known for its hallucinogenic properties. While honey hunting is particularly significant among the Gurung and Tamang people, it is also practiced by other communities in the Himalayas, including the Sherpas and various mountain tribes. Each group brings its own unique traditions and techniques to this ancient art.\nHowever, the challenges of modern life have begun to erode this ancient practice. The younger generation, increasingly drawn to urbanisation and other modern professions, seems disconnected from the traditions of their ancestors. Economic instability, limited educational opportunities, and inadequate healthcare facilities in these remote mountain villages have prompted many young people to seek better prospects elsewhere. Many leave their homes in search of better education, employment opportunities, and healthcare in urban centres or even abroad. This migration has led to a significant loss of traditional skills and knowledge as the remaining elders struggle to pass down their expertise.\nThe fear is that this essential cultural practice might become obsolete if these traditions are not actively preserved and embraced by the younger generation. As young villagers prioritize modern amenities and career opportunities, the rich heritage of honey hunting faces the risk of fading into obscurity.\nA Revival Through Global Interest\nFortunately, a new wave of interest in mad honey is sparking a revival of honey hunting practices. The global sensation surrounding mad honey has captured the attention of young Nepali entrepreneurs who see an opportunity to preserve their cultural heritage while improving their economic prospects. These innovators are not only making mad honey accessible worldwide through sophisticated marketing strategies and e-commerce platforms but are also bringing substantial economic benefits back to their villages.\nProminent among these entrepreneurs are Alex Deep Sapkota and Sudip Ghimire, who run a successful mad honey store (www.mad-honey.store). Their efforts are instrumental in transforming how mad honey is marketed and distributed on a global scale. They are not just focused on commercial success but are also committed to sustainable practices that protect the environment and support local Hunters.\nSapkota and Ghimire are actively involved in ensuring that honey hunting is carried out in an environmentally responsible manner. They are working closely with honey hunters in East Rukum, Lamjung, and other regions of Nepal to promote sustainable harvesting techniques that preserve bee populations and their natural habitats. Their initiatives include educating local hunters about the importance of bee conservation and implementing practices that minimise environmental impact.\nBy fostering a balance between economic gain and environmental stewardship, these young entrepreneurs are helping to secure the future of honey hunting. Their approach ensures that traditional practices can continue while also adapting to modern demands and ecological concerns. Through their efforts, not only is the cultural heritage of honey hunting being preserved, but the local economy is also benefiting from increased income and improved living standards.\nEconomic Impact and Cultural Revival\nThe international market for mad honey has opened up new revenue streams for the villages, allowing the local economy to flourish. With the rise in tourism and the global fascination with this unique product, villagers are experiencing a resurgence in interest and participation in honey hunting. This renewed interest has spurred the younger generation to become involved in the practice, bridging the gap between traditional methods and modern business opportunities.\nOne such example is Buddhiman Tamang, a 26-year-old from Lamjung, who comes from a long lineage of honey hunters. Buddhiman, the son of Nandalal—a seasoned honey hunter of 60 years—represents the future of this ancient practice. Nandalal had expressed concerns in 2018 that the tradition of honey hunting might soon end, as the skills and knowledge were not being successfully passed down to the younger generation. However, the situation has taken a positive turn. Nandalal’s own son, Buddiman, is now actively involved in honey hunting alongside his father and other experienced hunters.\nBuddhiman’s enthusiasm and modern outlook have not only helped him learn the intricacies of honey hunting but have also allowed him to integrate traditional practices with contemporary business strategies. His involvement is pivotal in ensuring the survival of this cultural heritage. Furthermore, Buddhiman’s active participation has inspired other young people in the village to engage in honey hunting, rekindling interest in the tradition and helping to secure its future. Through this generational collaboration, the ancient practice of honey hunting is finding new life and continuing to thrive in the modern era.\nPIC: Nandalal assisting his son Buddiman in carrying the bamboo ladder up the cliff, continuing a cherished family tradition.\nThe Future of Honey Hunting in Nepal\nThe revival of honey hunting through global interest and economic benefits is a testament to how tradition can adapt to modern times. As young villagers like Buddiman embrace both their heritage and the opportunities presented by the international market, there is hope that the ancient practice of honey hunting will continue to thrive.\nThe increasing number of tourists interested in witnessing the dramatic honey hunting expeditions also supports the local economy and creates a renewed sense of pride among the villagers. This cultural exchange fosters a deeper appreciation for the tradition and ensures its preservation for future generations.\nIn conclusion, while concerns about the end of honey hunting were once prevalent, the current trends suggest a promising future. Through global recognition and economic benefits, the tradition of honey hunting is being revitalized, bridging the gap between past and present and ensuring that the art of honey hunting endures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"\nIn the remote and rugged terrains of Nepal, the ancient practice of honey hunting has long been a tradition, passed down through generations of local villagers.

Through global recognition and economic benefits, the tradition of honey hunting is being revitalized, bridging the gap between past and present and ensuring that the art of honey hunting endures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"hash":"187ab60073eb33974b536901b3b84b06555c2bd1867e230f2bbb079327ee5e6b","title":"over-2-400-nepalis-benefit-from-document-certification-mobile-camp-in-portugal","date":1725926400000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/issues/over-2-400-nepalis-benefit-from-document-certification-mobile-camp-in-portugal","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/456041961_7813031932140427_7648443706163886674_n1725956334_1024.jpg","category":"issues","content":"\n More than 2,400 Nepalis have benefited from a document certification mobile service camp organized in Portugal.Altogether 2,468 Nepalis working and living in Portugal availed of the consular-related services including documents certification from the mobile service camp organized in Lisbon by the Embassy of Nepal in France.\nAmbassador of Nepal to France Sudheer Bhattarai, who is Nepal's non-residential ambassador to Portugal, said that 2,448 character certificates issued by Nepal Police, 16 academic qualification certificates, two travel permits and one authorization letter were certified and 20 personal incidents were registered in the camp.\nAccording to him, revenue worth 246 thousand and 640 Euro or NRs 36 million 709 thousand and 900 was collected for providing these services.\nDeputy Chief of Mission at the Embassy, Sita Basnet and Third Secretary Dipendra Prasad Saha were assigned in the service camp which provided consular services including document certification from August 30 to September 7.

Many central banks are still maintaining their tight monetary policy stance to manage the inflation. The interconnectedness of global markets needs policy harmonization to mitigate impact of global shocks on economic activity.A strong domestic financial system and robust institutional and policy framework is necessary to withstand external shocks, whether they stem from global financial crises, trade disruptions, or geopolitical tensions.\nUndergone significant reforms\nNepal's financial sector has undergone significant reforms, particularly during the three distinct phases. The first phase of reform, initiated in the mid-1980s, focused on promoting institution, liberalizing the banking sector, and enhancing the range of financial services offered. The second phase of reform, starting in the early 2000s, concentrated on improving regulatory frameworks, strengthening financial stability, and enhancing the operational efficiency of financial institutions specially the PS banks.\nPost-2010, the focus shifted towards financial consolidation. This period saw efforts to merge and consolidate financial institutions to create stronger entities improving resiliency in to the system that is capable of withstanding economic shocks and contributing to sustainable economic growth.\nAlong with the financial reforms, NRB has also embarked on a journey of significant operational reforms in monetary policy. This operational reform has been gradual, with the introduction of the interest rate corridor in 2016/17 and shifting towards the interest rate targeting from the reserve targeting in 2020/21 and aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission. We also introduced new instruments, such as a Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) in 2023/24 for effective implementation of IRC and effective liquidity management.\nThe recent policy reforms has been concentrated on modernizing the monetary policy operations, enhancing credit quality, emphasizing digital banking and FinTech, developing a modern payment system and its integration into the global market, and continuing the financial consolidation measures. Our focus is on better coordination between monetary and macroprudential policies.\nThe Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has been putting efforts to chanelise credit toward productive sectors to ensure that the banking sector supports sustainable economic development and can reduce the risk of asset bubbles. We have also been promoting financial inclusion as a Page 4 of 7 topmost priority encouraging MSME's, enhancing access, literacy, and consumer protection measures on financial services. Despite a series of global and domestic shocks like the global financial crisis of 2008, and 2015 Devastating earthquake and the COVID-19 pandemic, Nepal's financial system has shown resilience.\nThe growth momentum of more than 7 percent observed after the 2015 earthquake was halted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the global supply shocks. It is contracted from the historical average of 4.5 per cent to 1.9 per cent in 2022/23. The growth has now recovered to 3.9 percent in 2023/24. Specifically, the construction, manufacturing, and trade sectors were contracted in these two fiscal years.\nNepal also witnessed rising consumer price inflation with 8.6 percent in September 2022. Because of the timely policy interventions, weak internal demand, and some improvement in the supply side, inflation has now come down to 3.6 percent in July 2024, with annual average inflation of 5.4 percent in 2023/24, well below the target of 6.5 percent.\nNepal faced a rapid decline in foreign exchange reserves during late 2021 till 2022. NRB pursued a tighter monetary policy stance to preserve the reserve from further depletion. The Central Bank continued the higher interest rate policy regime for more than a year until May 2023, which has helped significantly to improve the external sector and also to contain inflation. To address the debt distress and protect small and medium-scale enterprises as a result of higher interest rates, we introduced some regulatory relaxation, loan rescheduling, and re-classification, among others.\nAt the same time, we continued reforms introducing the working capital guideline for standardizing the credit need assessments of corporate sectors. The external sector is in relatively comfortable position, with balance of payment and current account surplus, adequate FOREX reserve with import capacity of 13.7 months in July 2024. The interest rate has been declining, with the weighted average lending rate of commercial banks down to a single digit.\nSome challenges and way forward for financial system\nWith the balancing measures, we have been able to safeguard the overall macroeconomic stability. Now, the key challenge is sluggish credit demand despite the lowered interest rate and adequate liquidity in the banking system. Moreover, the decline in credit expansion despite lower interest rates highlights a concerted effort to stimulate domestic demand in the real sector and boost domestic economic activity.\nNepal is currently facing challenge in its economic landscape characterized by low growth, low savings, and low investment. In this context, monetary policy is expected by other stakeholder to act beyond its mandate without considering its limitations. Nepal's financial system has also been overloaded with structural issues, including the poorly developed insurance and capital market, especially the bond market.\nAnother emerging issue due to technological advancement and fintech in to the financial system is strengthening cyber security, protecting from scams and data breaches, on the eve of on-going financial digitalization. We have made substantial progress in digital payments and settlements, at the same time we need further work to ensure consumer protection and safety. Likewise, we are working further on interoperability on domestic and cross border payments and settlements. We are also studying new prospects like central bank digital currencies to cope with the digital era enhancing inclusion and monetary transmission effectiveness.\nTo summarize, the path ahead for us is addressing the challenges while maximizing the opportunities we have in the monetary and financial sectors. By maintaining a balanced approach to monetary policy, enhancing regulatory frameworks, continued reform and fostering financial inclusion, we aim to navigate the complexities of the financial landscape while ensuring sustainable and inclusive growth.\n[The writer is the Governor of Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank of the country.]\n","summary":"\nThe global economic situation continues to recover slowly and unevenly from the shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent geopolitical tensions.

Stakeholders have expressed the view that Nepal should take much benefit from tourism at a time when there is peace, stable politics and a strong government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"hash":"42ec4208eec9d7db33bb15c38f3f51a80b8576c49c4191a94cae942e176b5400","title":"charang-village-in-mustang","date":1726468538079,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/travel-and-tourism/charang-village-in-mustang","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/SantoshGautam_Myagdi_RSS_28_DSC082191726279977_1024.JPG","category":"travel-and-tourism","content":null,"summary":null},{"hash":"c5d781c30b10f9adad6eb767b63cf39731d74ede69c225a75f19008e62c155a8","title":"more-pilgrims-visit-to-mansarovar-kailash","date":1726468538417,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/travel-and-tourism/more-pilgrims-visit-to-mansarovar-kailash","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/mansarowar1726199232_1024.jpg","category":"travel-and-tourism","content":"\nThe number of pilgrims to Mansarovar Kailash in Tibet travelling through Rasuwagadhi border point has increased in the recent times compared to the previous year.Altogether 7,523 pilgrims went to Mansarovar Kailash, a religious shrine in China's Tibet, from May 14 to September 10 this year.\nChief of Rasuwagadhi Immigration Office in Timure Murari Niraula said that Nepalis make 60 per cent of the total pilgrims while 40 per cent are non-resident Nepalis (NRNs) from Australia, the USA, the UK and Canada.

As per the story that RSS disseminated, Chief at the District Health Office, Angad Bahadur Shahi, said it was not clear whether the girl was immunized against Japanese encephalitis.\nSimilarly, in the major streets of the federal capital itself, notices like 'Here, we fill up forms for visa application', 'Visit us for filling up forms for PSC exam', 'We prepare police reports here' etc are common sights.\nThese two references are just representative stories that are directly linked to the national ambition of 'Digital Nepal'. In the first case, the story showed there was no information/data at the hospital or health facility to ascertain if the girl was immunized, which the government provides before 23 months of one's birth, while the second story shows filling up forms for government services are mediated, but the service seekers themselves are not able to access the service on their own.\nWith the computerized system, people are freed from hand-written forms and waiting in lines for a long time to submit application forms. But, the dearth of digital literacy among the public is reflected well in it. The first story of the unavailability of the girl child's record on her health status signals equally poor data/information management at government offices.\nThe references seem marginal, but they are strong reminders of the current state in the campaign of transforming Nepal into the 'digital Nepal'.\nAs was the case some years back that witnessed huge demand and debate on 'smart city', even the leaders in economic sectors, including line ministers are saying that a time has come for Nepal as well to undergo a structural transformation of the national economy, but they fall short to explain how digital economy could play an integral role in this drive.\nOnce the local levels got the people's representatives for the first time since the enforcement of the current constitution, there was frenzy that 'smart city' could be ensured with the internet access. The debate fizzled out once they became aware that only internet expansion was not enough to set up the smart city. However, there is no denying that internet connection has increased significantly with gradual improvement in quality in Nepal.\nAlthough the internet is a prerequisite for digital transformation, there is much more to do to fully realize the transformation and achieve the ambition of Digital Nepal. The full realization of digital transformation does not leave anyone behind in the journey. Luxury of select people, society, professions, and classes who can afford better than a large number of people is not a transformation, but a blatant reflection of deepening inequality and the widening digital divide.\nOf course, there are many services Nepalis can receive digitally at present. There is a vibrant presence of people in the digital spheres expressing views and keeping close tab on public officials and agencies; media have gone digital; digital entertainment is on the rise; early warnings of weather change and its effects are issued. The drive of a paperless service is also gaining a pace. Even transportation is linked to the digital sphere thanks to ride-hailing services.\nBan on TikTok lifted\nIt is worth noting that the present government has earned accolade by lifting ban on TikTok, one of the most popular social media in Nepal. After lifting the ban, the government hailed the role of social media on promotion of freedom of expression. The TikTok, however, saw the ban for 10 months in the name of 'disrupting social harmony'.\nDespite this, we have no luxury of being happy over this achievement when we set the ambition of digital Nepal. The ambition needs to be all-encompassing that everyone from the poor, marginalized, and backward communities should be beneficiaries of the digital movements and campaigns.\nWe are in an inclusive and participatory system gained after struggles that lambasted the previous system for not addressing the diverse issues, opinions, demands and needs. It should in need be a lesson for us to pay heed to the needy ones as we negotiate the digital world.\nEncompass multiple fronts\nThe smooth and effective digital functioning in the fronts of economy, society, education, bureaucracy, politics, law and judiciary, parliament, health and agriculture can help materialize the Digital Nepal. Once the law and policymaking are delayed, the pace of digitalization is evidently slowed. It is worrying that the laws on information technology, cybercrime and cybersecurity are still awaited much in Nepal, while the wave of artificial intelligence is already engulfing the entire globe.\nSimilarly, flawless and frictionless flow of information/data along with interoperability in place paves way for the digital economy that links the cross-border business in the present globalized and hyper-connected context. However, security of data must be taken into account. Within the country, we have three tiers of government that can work in utmost collaboration to avoid duplications of digital campaigns and software developments.\nDigital transformation must not be limited to facilitating digital activities but also creating a digital economy. For it to happen, multi-layer governments, economic experts, tech giants, tech entrepreneurs, regulatory bodies and policymakers need to come together and mull how Nepal can create a digital economy that guarantees benefits to all.\nAs digital issues evolve continuously, the initiatives on it warrant timely and collaborative approaches rather than cut-throat competition among governments. Utilization of available tech experts within country can unburden governments from the hefty financial costs of digital investment.\nSimilarly, from agriculture to education and health to disaster, connection and engagement with digital spheres are imperative, thereby encompassing people from all sides, sectors and classes.\nTo conclude, how can citizens access to their information/data available at government offices?

Therefore, it would not be removed from official records, he said.Maoist lawmakers objected to the Speaker’s decision, called it biased, and resorted to obstructing the House.

As sugar was not readily available in the market, consumers were forced to queue for long hours at Salt Trading and Food Management and Trading Corporation.The corporation had imposed a quota system, allowing only two kgs at a time.The Cabinet meeting on September 9 permitted the Salt Trading Corporation and the Food Management and Trading Company to import 30,000 tonnes of sugar—15,000 tonnes each. The meeting also decided to waive 50 percent customs duty.“Importing sugar through global tender will cause a delay as the festive season nears,” said Sharmila Neupane Subedi, information officer at the Food Management and Trading Company.“So we are working on another option: to bring sugar through a G2G, or government-to-government, arrangement, which will speed up the process.” “If the G2G model does not work, then the possibility of importing sugar for Dashain, Tihar and Chhath is low,” Subedi said. These are the festivals when the demand for sugar rises exponentially. The supply firms have planned to import sugar in phases.The quantity of sugar to be brought in the first phase through the G2G arrangement is yet to be decided. “Once a certain amount of sugar is imported in the first phase, the remaining quantity will be imported through competitive bidding.”According to Subedi, the CEO of the Food Management and Trading Company had a first round of discussions with India’s National Cooperative Exports Limited about importing sugar through the G2G model.Subedi said that despite the government providing a 50 percent customs duty waiver, the price would be determined based on the rate set by the Indian counterpart. The retail price is Rs110 per kg in the market.Subedi said that the company has no stock of sugar. For more than a year, the Food Management and Trading Company has not imported the commodity.Kumar Rajbhandari, information officer at the Salt Trading Corporation, said his company opened the tender to import sugar two weeks ago. “If we can find Indian suppliers, sugar may arrive before the festival. All our efforts are directed at bringing sugar on time.

However, sugar is also consumed in high quantities in Tihar and Chhath when tonnes of sweet items are sold across the country. Nepal consumes 275,000 tonnes of sugar annually, of which 150,000 tonnes are produced in the country while the rest is imported.Consumer rights activists suspect the motive behind the delayed sugar procurement process. “This year, too, the government delayed its decision—an intentional delay that occurs during the festivals every year,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum.“The sugar price will shoot up.”Maharjan said the delay leaves ample room to suspect a collusion between powerful traders and the government. The delay favours private traders, who will artificially raise the price, he added.The National Consumer Forum wrote a letter to the government on the issue three months ago.Last year, on September 13, the finance ministry approved the import of 20,000 tonnes of sugar for the festive season. The Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies had asked to import 60,000 tonnes to meet the anticipated demand.The finance ministry’s delayed approval caused panic in the market, and on that pretext, sugar prices nearly doubled, according to consumer rights activists.“When it comes to sugar imports, something fishy happens every year,” they said.In October last year, India, the world’s biggest sugar producer after Brazil, banned mills from exporting sugar—in its first sugar export curb in seven years.According to Reuters, India plans to extend a ban on sugar exports for the second straight year as the world’s biggest sweetener consumer grapples with the prospect of a lower sugarcane output.According to the news agency, New Delhi plans to prohibit mills from exporting sugar when supplies from Brazil, the world’s top producer, are expected to drop because of a drought in the South American nation.In November last year, when the country was facing a serious sugar crisis, India allowed Nepal to import 25,000 tonnes with immediate effect, valid until September this year. However, with Indian suppliers quoting high prices, Nepal reached out to Pakistan for the sweetener—to no avail. ","summary":"Nepal may face a sugar shortage in the upcoming festival season as the two government supply firms importing the household sweetener started off late.Last year, Nepal faced a sugar shortage during the festive season, with the price jumping from Rs90 to Rs160 per kg. As sugar was not readily available in the market, consumers were forced to queue for long hours at Salt Trading and Food Management and Trading Corporation.The corporation had imposed a quota system, allowing only two kgs at a time.The Cabinet meeting on September 9 permitted the Salt Trading Corporation and the Food Management and Trading Company to import 30,000 tonnes of sugar—15,000 tonnes each. The meeting also decided to waive 50 percent customs duty.“Importing sugar through global tender will cause a delay as the festive season nears,” said Sharmila Neupane Subedi, information officer at the Food Management and Trading Company.“So we are working on another option: to bring sugar through a G2G, or government-to-government, arrangement, which will speed up the process.” “If the G2G model does not work, then the possibility of importing sugar for Dashain, Tihar and Chhath is low,” Subedi said. These are the festivals when the demand for sugar rises exponentially. The supply firms have planned to import sugar in phases.The quantity of sugar to be brought in the first phase through the G2G arrangement is yet to be decided. “Once a certain amount of sugar is imported in the first phase, the remaining quantity will be imported through competitive bidding.”According to Subedi, the CEO of the Food Management and Trading Company had a first round of discussions with India’s National Cooperative Exports Limited about importing sugar through the G2G model.Subedi said that despite the government providing a 50 percent customs duty waiver, the price would be determined based on the rate set by the Indian counterpart. The retail price is Rs110 per kg in the market.Subedi said that the company has no stock of sugar. For more than a year, the Food Management and Trading Company has not imported the commodity.Kumar Rajbhandari, information officer at the Salt Trading Corporation, said his company opened the tender to import sugar two weeks ago. “If we can find Indian suppliers, sugar may arrive before the festival. All our efforts are directed at bringing sugar on time. We are prepared to sign an agreement within seven days after the supplier is chosen.”According to Rajbhandari, they started the preparation a long time ago but got the letter from the government late.“We were prepared and opened the tender as soon as we received the nod,” said Rajbhandari.This year, the Dashain begins on October 3.

Although the country has been practising federalism since the 2017 elections, Madheshi parties are seen as undermining it rather than strengthening it, say political analysts. “When it comes to Madhesh, we must separate the Madhesi parties, the Madhesi agenda, and the Madhesi people.

The country’s two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a coalition government a month ago with a commitment to reviewing and amending the constitution. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert Purna Man Shakya to discuss the good and bad aspects of the constitution amendment process.The Congress and the UML have floated a proposal to amend the constitution. Is the time ripe to make changes in our statute?Generally, constitutions are reviewed after around a decade of their implementation. So, we have come to the stage of reviewing whether our constitution has functioned properly. However, the sudden announcement of the amendment is premature, as this is a serious business. In our case, the constitution can’t be amended just based on the interest of one or two parties. It requires a national consensus. There should be an understanding among the political parties represented in Parliament. And, a sort of consensus even among the people’s level is important as there was huge public involvement in making this constitution. Sentiment of various communities must be respected while making any changes in the national charter. What can be the modality of seeking consensus at the people’s level? Should a draft be prepared and opened up for debate?While making changes in the constitution, some issues might be technical and not of interest to common people. But if any changes are made in policy issues that can alter our country’s structural dynamics, the concerned communities must be consulted. Just the present strength of the political parties represented in Parliament is no guarantee that they truly represent people. For instance, the Maoists emerged as the largest party through the election in 2008. But it has been shrunk to a distant third in the House. However, we can’t conclude from this that the people have discarded the party’s agenda. The Maoists might have been discredited due to their activities and failure in delivery but people might still favour the agenda they once championed. Similar is the case with other parties. Therefore, we have to consider broader consensus both in Parliament as well as the people’s level.How challenging is it to enter the constitution amendment process?Any amendment calls for a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives as well as the National Assembly in the federal parliament. If an issue is linked to provincial authority, it should be endorsed by the majority [four] of seven provinces. So, this is not easy. Therefore, the parties should tread carefully.You mentioned earlier that constitution amendments without a review process is not a right step. Could you elaborate?The right way is to first have broad understanding among the top leaders of political forces on the issues and then constitute a panel of experts to conduct a comprehensive study on that. Such studies are conducted through two methods—doctrinal and non-doctrinal. The doctrinal method analyses related literature and principles on theoretical approach while the non-doctrinal method studies the public sentiments and opinions through surveys and interactions, and comes up with certain methodologies with the help of subject experts. Through such study, the experts identify the issues and recommend the ways to the politicians. This is the right process.There are also arguments that reviewing the constitution without even bringing it into full-fledged implementation is wrong. Based on the practice during these years, we have concluded that certain provisions didn’t work properly. It is true that we are talking about making changes in the constitution without even implementing certain provisions. First we have to give the system an opportunity to work in a full-fledged way. Then, we can evaluate whether it worked. Any move to dissolve the system without properly implementing it will create divisions and invite another conflict. A question that is often asked: Is there a problem with our constitution or with our politicians? People can change the constitution but the constitution can’t change the people. Therefore, a constitution should be developed also on the basis of the nature of people in the country who use it. If our political parties and the politicians had reformed themselves, we might not have had to discuss constitutional changes time and again. We should have made the system strong for more effective checks and balances and made leaders and officials more accountable. The ruling parties reason that the constitution amendment became necessary to ensure political stability.When a federal government is changed, its aftershocks are immediately seen in all seven provincial governments. It directly impacts development and other activities across the country. It’s a flaw in our party system but we have to find a solution in the system. We see people raising voices for two things—stability and retirement of old politicians. As Nepali politicians never retire voluntarily, we have to address it through the system. Direct election of executive head can be one way to address this problem. People have found local governments more effective than federal and provincial governments. It is because chiefs and representatives of local governments are directly elected and they can serve the full five-year term.Once people are given the right to elect heads of government, they won’t elect old faces such as KP Oli, Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prachanda [Pushpa Kamal Dahal], who have been tested multiple times. It will serve two purposes—first, it gives stability and second, it allows popular leaders to emerge in place of the old ones. The old leaders have maintained control over national politics through their huge party organisations. But when people directly elect presidents and chief ministers their grip over party organisations can’t be decisive in national politics. For that we have to amend the constitution.However, again, an expert team needs to thoroughly study the pros and cons of such changes. But what I can say based on the general study of public perception is that we can first go for direct election of executive heads at the provincial level. In the next phase we can go for direct presidential election at the federal level.What went wrong in the practice of the three-tier federal system?While adopting federalism, the basic idea was to allow the local governments to oversee local matters while the provincial governments would handle wide ranges of issues related to agriculture, industry, forest, education and health, etcetera. If the two sub-national governments handle these things, people don’t need to come to the centre seeking solutions to their problems. In such a scenario, the federal government can focus on important affairs such as foreign relations, defence, telecommunication, currency, national infrastructure projects and inter-provincial affairs. Such division of powers would automatically create specialisation in the respective governments.But the federal system is not implemented as per that spirit. Provinces aren’t allowed to exercise their rights. People are still travelling to Kathmandu all the way from remote districts even for basic things. The constitution has mandated the provinces to maintain law and order in their respective provinces but the federal government hasn’t allowed them to have their own police forces. Provinces without police have become like administrative units. The centre has a huge bureaucracy in Kathmandu. It is high time that the centre delegates authority to provinces as per the constitutional spirit. Federal lawmakers have huge interest in local development activities because it is directly related to their election. They don’t want to lose this influence. The interest of federal lawmakers however contradicts with the constitution.There is also a belief that the local level has authority in areas where they can’t work effectively, for instance they are mandated to oversee the education system up to grade 12 while provinces don’t have much role. Do you think such jurisdictional matters need to be reviewed and provinces should be given more authority?That’s right. First of all, we should be clear that there is no point in adopting a federal system if we don’t want provinces because we had central and local levels even in the past. Provincial layer is an integral part of federalism. So, we have to think about transferring certain rights from local to provincial level because the local units don’t have expertise to oversee education up to grade 12 on their own. Our local units are traditionally trained in local development activities. But now they are entrusted with the responsibility of not only overseeing education and health issues but also with legislative and judicial functions. They haven’t been able to play that role. We should think about transferring some roles from local to provincial levels. Likewise, the centre should be ready to allow the provinces to exercise their rights bestowed by the constitution. It is time to strengthen the provinces.You said direct election of executive heads in provinces could end instability at the provincial level. But what if a popular leader got elected chief minister but other political parties won majority seats in the provincial assemblies? In such a situation, the rival parties may not help the chief minister pass a budget or policies from the assembly.Yes, there are strengths and weaknesses of all systems. Such problems can be resolved because we see similar situations in other countries as well. Parties can’t prolong the deadlock in the House because they will be blamed for the impasse. One basis is that our local units are doing well under executive heads. So, we can practise it for a decade in the provinces and then apply it to the federal level based on that experience.Many forces and groups that aren’t happy with the present constitution, which was basically a compromise document. Once the constitution amendment process is open, they are certain to revive their demands. Will the situation be manageable?If the rights of historically marginalised communities are curtailed, they will certainly retaliate. If you try to go against the federal republic system and policy of inclusion, it may invite new conflicts. The proportional representation system is not a problem. Leaders made it unpopular by misusing it. We should find solutions to stop its misuse. We shouldn’t forget that this constitution is not only a constitution but also a key document of our peace process. This is not perfect but it was essential to end the conflict. Many say that while making a document of compromise, our constitution hasn’t followed the principles of constitutionalism. For instance, the hearing system is something unusual in a parliamentary system. As a constitutional expert, do you think we should also think about fixing such deviations?You are right. When we couldn’t change the people, we tried to add additional features as a measure to check the wrongdoings. Our leaders make appointments in key constitutional bodies guided by their personal and partisan interests. We copied the hearing practice from the presidential system with a view to check the leaders’ arbitrary appointments. It hasn’t been that effective. Therefore, we have proposed to give continuity to the hearing for political appointments but not in the appointments of judges because lawmakers don’t have the expertise to examine judges’ competence. Since lawmakers are mainly guided by the party’s whip and top leaders’ instructions, it rather increases political interference even in the judiciary. We have thus proposed to stop the hearing process for judges’ appointments.Many say that the judiciary hasn’t been federalized even though all other sectors have been restructured as per the three-tier federal system. Why this exception for the judiciary?Oh, you dragged me to a sensitive topic. One thing we shouldn’t forget is that we adopted a federal system not to unify small countries. We were already a united country. We adopted it to better manage our social diversity by involving all the communities in the governing system. We at the same time have to safeguard the country from disintegration. Judiciary, the national army and Nepali language are our institutional arrangements that can play a unifying role. Therefore, we didn’t make much changes in these three aspects.Some instances show that Nepal’s federalism might have been a bit more effective had the judiciary worked proactively. For instance, the court hasn’t decided even the cases filed by provinces years ago. What do you think about the judiciary’s role in this connection?Yes, those cases are still undecided. In the Constituent Assembly, the Maoist party had registered a proposal to form a separate constitutional court. The justices who were leading the judiciary at the time opposed the idea. It was later rejected. Then the idea to have a separate constitutional bench was included as a compromise deal. But it has failed to work effectively. It failed to decide election-related disputes. We have to review its jurisdiction. They have decided certain cases when there is public pressure. For instance they decided cases like House dissolution because there was constant public scrutiny. But they haven’t shown any interest in other important cases where constitutional interpretation is needed. Of late, a strong opinion is being built in favour of forming a separate constitutional court. These issues are being discussed seriously. This issue may emerge if the constitution amendment process begins.What we can infer from your analysis is that the constitution amendment process is not that easy. What are the basic things that should be and can be done in the constitution amendment at this stage?First, we should change the form of governance at the provincial level and go for a directly elected executive head. With this there will be no change in government in provinces after changes at the centre. The governments in provinces can work for five years with certainty. Second, we can transfer the powers that the local units have failed to exercise to provinces. And, the centre should allow the provinces to exercise the concurrent rights. By doing this the centre can reduce the overwhelming burden on it. While the provinces can play an implementing role, the federation can play a supervisory role. These things need to be fixed. We need some amendments to the constitution and some new laws for this. ","summary":"Nepal is marking its ninth Constitution Day on Thursday. The country’s two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a coalition government a month ago with a commitment to reviewing and amending the constitution. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert Purna Man Shakya to discuss the good and bad aspects of the constitution amendment process.The Congress and the UML have floated a proposal to amend the constitution. Is the time ripe to make changes in our statute?Generally, constitutions are reviewed after around a decade of their implementation. So, we have come to the stage of reviewing whether our constitution has functioned properly. However, the sudden announcement of the amendment is premature, as this is a serious business. In our case, the constitution can’t be amended just based on the interest of one or two parties. It requires a national consensus. There should be an understanding among the political parties represented in Parliament. And, a sort of consensus even among the people’s level is important as there was huge public involvement in making this constitution. Sentiment of various communities must be respected while making any changes in the national charter. What can be the modality of seeking consensus at the people’s level? Should a draft be prepared and opened up for debate?While making changes in the constitution, some issues might be technical and not of interest to common people. But if any changes are made in policy issues that can alter our country’s structural dynamics, the concerned communities must be consulted. Just the present strength of the political parties represented in Parliament is no guarantee that they truly represent people. For instance, the Maoists emerged as the largest party through the election in 2008. But it has been shrunk to a distant third in the House. However, we can’t conclude from this that the people have discarded the party’s agenda. The Maoists might have been discredited due to their activities and failure in delivery but people might still favour the agenda they once championed. Similar is the case with other parties. Therefore, we have to consider broader consensus both in Parliament as well as the people’s level.How challenging is it to enter the constitution amendment process?Any amendment calls for a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives as well as the National Assembly in the federal parliament. If an issue is linked to provincial authority, it should be endorsed by the majority [four] of seven provinces. So, this is not easy. Therefore, the parties should tread carefully.You mentioned earlier that constitution amendments without a review process is not a right step. Could you elaborate?The right way is to first have broad understanding among the top leaders of political forces on the issues and then constitute a panel of experts to conduct a comprehensive study on that. Such studies are conducted through two methods—doctrinal and non-doctrinal. The doctrinal method analyses related literature and principles on theoretical approach while the non-doctrinal method studies the public sentiments and opinions through surveys and interactions, and comes up with certain methodologies with the help of subject experts. Through such study, the experts identify the issues and recommend the ways to the politicians. This is the right process.There are also arguments that reviewing the constitution without even bringing it into full-fledged implementation is wrong. Based on the practice during these years, we have concluded that certain provisions didn’t work properly. It is true that we are talking about making changes in the constitution without even implementing certain provisions. First we have to give the system an opportunity to work in a full-fledged way. Then, we can evaluate whether it worked. Any move to dissolve the system without properly implementing it will create divisions and invite another conflict. A question that is often asked: Is there a problem with our constitution or with our politicians? People can change the constitution but the constitution can’t change the people. Therefore, a constitution should be developed also on the basis of the nature of people in the country who use it. If our political parties and the politicians had reformed themselves, we might not have had to discuss constitutional changes time and again. We should have made the system strong for more effective checks and balances and made leaders and officials more accountable. The ruling parties reason that the constitution amendment became necessary to ensure political stability.When a federal government is changed, its aftershocks are immediately seen in all seven provincial governments. It directly impacts development and other activities across the country. It’s a flaw in our party system but we have to find a solution in the system. We see people raising voices for two things—stability and retirement of old politicians. As Nepali politicians never retire voluntarily, we have to address it through the system. Direct election of executive head can be one way to address this problem. People have found local governments more effective than federal and provincial governments. It is because chiefs and representatives of local governments are directly elected and they can serve the full five-year term.Once people are given the right to elect heads of government, they won’t elect old faces such as KP Oli, Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prachanda [Pushpa Kamal Dahal], who have been tested multiple times. It will serve two purposes—first, it gives stability and second, it allows popular leaders to emerge in place of the old ones. The old leaders have maintained control over national politics through their huge party organisations. But when people directly elect presidents and chief ministers their grip over party organisations can’t be decisive in national politics. For that we have to amend the constitution.However, again, an expert team needs to thoroughly study the pros and cons of such changes. But what I can say based on the general study of public perception is that we can first go for direct election of executive heads at the provincial level. In the next phase we can go for direct presidential election at the federal level.What went wrong in the practice of the three-tier federal system?While adopting federalism, the basic idea was to allow the local governments to oversee local matters while the provincial governments would handle wide ranges of issues related to agriculture, industry, forest, education and health, etcetera. If the two sub-national governments handle these things, people don’t need to come to the centre seeking solutions to their problems. In such a scenario, the federal government can focus on important affairs such as foreign relations, defence, telecommunication, currency, national infrastructure projects and inter-provincial affairs. Such division of powers would automatically create specialisation in the respective governments.But the federal system is not implemented as per that spirit. Provinces aren’t allowed to exercise their rights. People are still travelling to Kathmandu all the way from remote districts even for basic things. The constitution has mandated the provinces to maintain law and order in their respective provinces but the federal government hasn’t allowed them to have their own police forces. Provinces without police have become like administrative units. The centre has a huge bureaucracy in Kathmandu. It is high time that the centre delegates authority to provinces as per the constitutional spirit. Federal lawmakers have huge interest in local development activities because it is directly related to their election. They don’t want to lose this influence. The interest of federal lawmakers however contradicts with the constitution.There is also a belief that the local level has authority in areas where they can’t work effectively, for instance they are mandated to oversee the education system up to grade 12 while provinces don’t have much role. Do you think such jurisdictional matters need to be reviewed and provinces should be given more authority?That’s right. First of all, we should be clear that there is no point in adopting a federal system if we don’t want provinces because we had central and local levels even in the past. Provincial layer is an integral part of federalism. So, we have to think about transferring certain rights from local to provincial level because the local units don’t have expertise to oversee education up to grade 12 on their own. Our local units are traditionally trained in local development activities. But now they are entrusted with the responsibility of not only overseeing education and health issues but also with legislative and judicial functions. They haven’t been able to play that role. We should think about transferring some roles from local to provincial levels. Likewise, the centre should be ready to allow the provinces to exercise their rights bestowed by the constitution. It is time to strengthen the provinces.You said direct election of executive heads in provinces could end instability at the provincial level. But what if a popular leader got elected chief minister but other political parties won majority seats in the provincial assemblies? In such a situation, the rival parties may not help the chief minister pass a budget or policies from the assembly.Yes, there are strengths and weaknesses of all systems. Such problems can be resolved because we see similar situations in other countries as well. Parties can’t prolong the deadlock in the House because they will be blamed for the impasse. One basis is that our local units are doing well under executive heads. So, we can practise it for a decade in the provinces and then apply it to the federal level based on that experience.Many forces and groups that aren’t happy with the present constitution, which was basically a compromise document. Once the constitution amendment process is open, they are certain to revive their demands. Will the situation be manageable?If the rights of historically marginalised communities are curtailed, they will certainly retaliate. If you try to go against the federal republic system and policy of inclusion, it may invite new conflicts. The proportional representation system is not a problem. Leaders made it unpopular by misusing it. We should find solutions to stop its misuse. We shouldn’t forget that this constitution is not only a constitution but also a key document of our peace process. This is not perfect but it was essential to end the conflict. Many say that while making a document of compromise, our constitution hasn’t followed the principles of constitutionalism. For instance, the hearing system is something unusual in a parliamentary system. As a constitutional expert, do you think we should also think about fixing such deviations?You are right. When we couldn’t change the people, we tried to add additional features as a measure to check the wrongdoings. Our leaders make appointments in key constitutional bodies guided by their personal and partisan interests. We copied the hearing practice from the presidential system with a view to check the leaders’ arbitrary appointments. It hasn’t been that effective. Therefore, we have proposed to give continuity to the hearing for political appointments but not in the appointments of judges because lawmakers don’t have the expertise to examine judges’ competence. Since lawmakers are mainly guided by the party’s whip and top leaders’ instructions, it rather increases political interference even in the judiciary. We have thus proposed to stop the hearing process for judges’ appointments.Many say that the judiciary hasn’t been federalized even though all other sectors have been restructured as per the three-tier federal system. Why this exception for the judiciary?Oh, you dragged me to a sensitive topic. One thing we shouldn’t forget is that we adopted a federal system not to unify small countries. We were already a united country. We adopted it to better manage our social diversity by involving all the communities in the governing system. We at the same time have to safeguard the country from disintegration. Judiciary, the national army and Nepali language are our institutional arrangements that can play a unifying role. Therefore, we didn’t make much changes in these three aspects.Some instances show that Nepal’s federalism might have been a bit more effective had the judiciary worked proactively. For instance, the court hasn’t decided even the cases filed by provinces years ago. What do you think about the judiciary’s role in this connection?Yes, those cases are still undecided. In the Constituent Assembly, the Maoist party had registered a proposal to form a separate constitutional court. The justices who were leading the judiciary at the time opposed the idea. It was later rejected. Then the idea to have a separate constitutional bench was included as a compromise deal. But it has failed to work effectively. It failed to decide election-related disputes. We have to review its jurisdiction. They have decided certain cases when there is public pressure. For instance they decided cases like House dissolution because there was constant public scrutiny. But they haven’t shown any interest in other important cases where constitutional interpretation is needed. Of late, a strong opinion is being built in favour of forming a separate constitutional court. These issues are being discussed seriously. This issue may emerge if the constitution amendment process begins.What we can infer from your analysis is that the constitution amendment process is not that easy. What are the basic things that should be and can be done in the constitution amendment at this stage?First, we should change the form of governance at the provincial level and go for a directly elected executive head.

Meanwhile, with emerging facts about the consequences of rising polar temperatures, it seems like the worst is yet to come. Our efforts to fight the climate crisis are painfully lacking. Recall the severe droughts of the last two winters. They weren't just regular droughts, as observed in the past decades, but a clear example of how climate phenomena occurring thousands of miles away have a bearing on the weather systems supporting our livelihoods and economy. The lack of winter rain has been attributed to the warming of the Indian Ocean and disruption of the Arctic polar vortex, as revealed by researchers examining the western Nepal winter drought of 2009, one of the most severe droughts in recent memory. Since then, winter droughts have been more frequent and lasted longer. With the Arctic region ceaselessly heating up four times faster than other areas, the cascading impacts on the Westerlies—responsible for bringing winter rains to our region—will undoubtedly continue to be strong. The Westerlies are also responsible for snow deposits at higher altitudes, including in the trans-Himalayan region of the country. As reported recently, farmers who rely on apple orchards as a major income source in Nepal’s northern region are already losing out as they've seen a massive drop in apple production in the last three years due to the lack of snow; its reversal seems unlikely.Rare warming eventsRapid warming isn’t limited to the Arctic. Climate science research has revealed worrying facts from the Antarctic, too. A recent report discovered a series of rare instances of the warming of the stratosphere (the upper atmosphere about 30 km above the ground) over Antarctica. Unlike the Arctic, where such warming events are almost annual, these are uncommon in the Antarctic. Consequently, the polar vortex in the Southern Hemisphere normally remains more stable. However, according to the report, on July 7, the temperature in the middle of the stratosphere, which usually hovered around -80 degrees Celsius, reached 15 degrees Celcius. It cooled briefly and then rose to 17 degrees Celsius on August 5. This record-breaking warming over the Antarctic in the last 44 years has stunned researchers. Subsequently, the warming has disrupted the Antarctic polar vortex and affected global weather patterns. Since the explanation for such sudden warming is yet to be ascertained, it appears connected to a higher ozone concentration over the region. Researchers believe that warming occurred when the ozone from other latitudes was drawn towards the polar region, a renewed concern in climate discourse. Whatever the reason, this raises questions regarding how it might play out when viewed from a teleconnection perspective, where events in one corner of the globe affect the weather in another. Though they are poles apart and occur alternatively, it's yet to be seen if the warming of the poles and disruption of the vortex will produce any combined effect on the global weather system even more severely in future. Moreover, we must stay vigilant of any major event with a potential bearing on our weather system, like the disruption of the Arctic polar vortex suppressing the Westerlies. This should persuade us to consider what might be in store for our vital economic sectors of agriculture, tourism and energy. Historical eventsThere isn’t much written about historical weather-related issues that shaped our land and sometimes demographic structure. Although such events have been recurrent, they are now more destructive and alarmingly frequent. One such incident was a mega-drought in 1919, which led to widespread crop failure and livestock deaths. Those who couldn’t grow enough to feed their families moved to India and Burma (present-day Myanmar)—perhaps contributing to the drop in Nepal's national population from 5.63 million in 1911 to 5.57 million in 1920, a fall of nearly 1.2 percent. The historical mega-drought illustrates that the state made no effort to help people cope with the situation. People had no option but to escape the drought by moving elsewhere to start anew. A century later, the situation hasn’t changed much. Despite several organisations at the national and local levels working on projects—many of them for decades—to address climate change together with government plans and policies, the impacts of drought, floods, declining water sources, forest fires and so on continue to rise, and so do the numbers of those impacted. Addressing these issues seems more complex because of a lack of local-level information, compounded by a limited workforce and nominal financial resources to implement appropriate climate actions. Reviewing past eventsWith the increasing severity of climate impacts, we must play smart. There's a need to identify area-specific problems because climate responses aren’t always one-size-fits-all. The responses must be tailored to suit local needs for specific issues an area faces several times a year. For example, areas at higher altitudes are threatened by expanding glacial lakes occasionally resulting in Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) and, more seriously, reduced snowfall, leading to increased drought. Middle hills face increased localised high-intensity rain, worsening the widespread problem of erosion, mass wasting, loss of farmlands, drying water sources, etc. The low-lying areas of the valleys and Tarai region are increasingly being affected by floods, sand casting and river bank erosion. From a practical standpoint, locating potential GLOF sites is pretty straightforward. They can be mapped for their state of critical urgency and area of influence in case the dams break. Planning for their mitigation can be done through proven methods of reducing the water level or installing early warning systems. However, developing effective and precise methods to address increasing droughts is an entirely different issue. It’s even more challenging to address the problems of the middle hills, which are extensive and difficult to foresee for their critical urgency. As the imminent crises develop, we have no option but to move quickly with workable coping strategies. Reviewing historical events in each area would help us understand which regions or communities within the country are at higher risk and plan accordingly for quick and effective responses with the available resources. ","summary":"Despite the rhetoric of decarbonising the economy and ambitious pledges made to cut emissions to keep temperatures below 1.5 degrees Celsius during the annual Conference of the Parties meetings, extreme weather occurrences fueled by global warming are increasing, raising questions globally as to why the progress towards climate mitigation remains so slow. Meanwhile, with emerging facts about the consequences of rising polar temperatures, it seems like the worst is yet to come. Our efforts to fight the climate crisis are painfully lacking. Recall the severe droughts of the last two winters. They weren't just regular droughts, as observed in the past decades, but a clear example of how climate phenomena occurring thousands of miles away have a bearing on the weather systems supporting our livelihoods and economy. The lack of winter rain has been attributed to the warming of the Indian Ocean and disruption of the Arctic polar vortex, as revealed by researchers examining the western Nepal winter drought of 2009, one of the most severe droughts in recent memory. Since then, winter droughts have been more frequent and lasted longer. With the Arctic region ceaselessly heating up four times faster than other areas, the cascading impacts on the Westerlies—responsible for bringing winter rains to our region—will undoubtedly continue to be strong. The Westerlies are also responsible for snow deposits at higher altitudes, including in the trans-Himalayan region of the country. As reported recently, farmers who rely on apple orchards as a major income source in Nepal’s northern region are already losing out as they've seen a massive drop in apple production in the last three years due to the lack of snow; its reversal seems unlikely.Rare warming eventsRapid warming isn’t limited to the Arctic. Climate science research has revealed worrying facts from the Antarctic, too. A recent report discovered a series of rare instances of the warming of the stratosphere (the upper atmosphere about 30 km above the ground) over Antarctica. Unlike the Arctic, where such warming events are almost annual, these are uncommon in the Antarctic. Consequently, the polar vortex in the Southern Hemisphere normally remains more stable. However, according to the report, on July 7, the temperature in the middle of the stratosphere, which usually hovered around -80 degrees Celsius, reached 15 degrees Celcius.

This was the 17th in the series started by Social Science Baha in 2003 with the lecture of the well-known Nepali scholar Harka Gurung.Nepali historian and research director of Martin Chautari, Pratyoush Onta, brought this subject to the audience’s attention. He presented the outline of Whelpton's works by bringing forth his scholarship and his easy and human approach, as seen in his oeuvre and also in the technical features of them. According to political scientist Hari Sharma, Whelpton's works on Nepali history and society are an act of love that is performed sans huge foreign funds, sans institutional connections and sans any noise of the familiar order. Whelpton’s scholarship and studies on Nepal sound more like a literary writer's passion for people and places. People of different interests and expertise attended the talk series, including senior historian Triratna Manandhar, Kanak Dixit, and the young generation. The lecture, slightly overstretched, went well for several reasons. First, the treatment of the subject by this senior historian, who, according to Onta, entirely created the character of his scholarship from his close connection with Nepal, was interesting. Second, Whelpton evoked a matter that is most bandied about by Nepali historians, politicians and common people, which is the famous remark made by the founder of modern Nepal, the king of the house of Gorkha, Prithvi Narayan Shah (1723-75). Shah said he discovered that Nepal is \"a yam between two rocks”. This statement, Dui dhunga bichko tarul or yam between two large boulders, is included in the text Badamaharajdhiraj Shri Pach Prithivi Narayan Shah ko Divya Upadesh (2002), the jointly edited document by two famous historians Baburam Acharya and Yogi Naraharinath. It has become a famous cliché in Nepali parlance. The dhunga imagery has become so entrenched that the former director of the Centre for Nepal and Asian Studies, Nirmal Man Tuladhar, found Whelptons’ translation of this word into 'rock' inappropriate. This shows how King Shah's aphoristic statement has become part of our imagination.In the lecture available online, Whelpton does not directly begin with the topic. Even the name of Prithvi Narayan Shah appears a little later in the text, which shows the nature of the discourse's structure. Whelpton uses rock imagery as an important piece of historical memory. That is precisely the penchant of King Shah for action in history and the wisdom that he puts in his exhortations.He has brought the history of China and India to what may be explained as the imagery of Nepal's geopolitical existence. He cites Leo Rose's view and his explanation of the yam imagery and Nepal's clever manipulation of policies between the two big neighbours. However, it can be easily assessed how Shah himself saw the need to manoeuvre between the neighbours when he used the dui dhunga or the two boulders in his exhortation. This need for manoeuvring has become both an existentialist angst of Nepal and its pragmatism. The subtle story continues even today when the Eminent Person Group on India-Nepal relations have devised plans for a new “peace, friendship treaty with India” replacing the existing one. India has not yet responded to this. As far as I know, no such group of 'eminent persons' exists between Nepal and China.Whelpton looks at the difference between Nepal and China on the one hand and India on the other by evoking the colonial history. He says, ''India, in contrast to both China and Nepal, is the product of what could be called external rather than internal imperialism: That is forced unification by a distant colonial power instead of by conquerors based in an area within the boundaries they created.'' However, Whelpton does not elaborate on how this postcolonial situation makes a difference in the yam and rock conditionality perceived by Shah. John shows how Shah’s conquests occurred when \"the East India Company was consolidating its control over the Gangetic plain, and China’s Qing dynasty was reaching the apogee of its power.\" The yam imagery of Shah continues to occupy the minds of Nepalis who espouse different political views and ideas about the country’s political situation. Those who hold republican ideas look at Shah's view like the spectres of history. Their arguments are imbued a little with the Hamletian dilemma of whether or not to repeat a feudal king's wisdom in modern times. This reminds us of the views of French theorist Jacques Derrida, who, in his book Spectres of Marx, takes up Francis Fukuyama's theory that Marxism, even though it was disposed of in 1989, is not dead. The feudal king's theory about the monarchical system and the dream of expansion is dead, but his geopolitical perception of history, as presented in the spectre of yam and boulder, is not. We are dealing with this reality in everyday life. Whelpton has presented a long analysis of Chinese politics and policies to evoke the conditionality of yam and boulder. That the historian Whelpton should write a very readable political analysis of the geo-political conditionality shows that history is an ongoing process of living interpretation.Whelpton concluded his presentation by evoking a theory of prudence and pragmatism. He advocates what he calls a two-track approach, which he thinks is inevitable. He advocates for a need to 'press for a paradigm shift' and an accommodation approach to India. The same is true of India. As the yam between boulders is the reality, approaches should be made to address that condition. Whelpton sees the role of civil society in this. The geopolitical conditions of borders arouse emotions; it has also become the greatest reality in our century. However, recognising the multidimensional aspects of history is what the nations in this region and outside are grappling with today. So, the imagery of yam can be a valuable trigger for studying history and planning for the future. Whelpton's Regmi lecture briefly and productively addressed these questions.    ","summary":"British Nepali historian John Whelpton, who has researched Nepali history and politics, evoked a subject of Nepali historical discussions at the Mahesh Chandra Regmi Lecture 2024 on September 11.

This time, my wife and I decided to hop on trains—Delhi to Dehradun to Lucknow to New Jalpaiguri; our journey punctuated by brief halts of two-three days in each city.Taking a train, we wanted to grab an opportunity to meet people—and more people—along the journey. There was no reason to be disappointed. We met new people, made new friends, shared contacts and even promised: “See you again.” Trains have always fascinated me since my childhood when I got my first experience on the locomotive from Rupaidiha to Nanpara. For someone who grew up in a Nepalgunj village, I had many friends at whose homes I would play and eat, not having an iota of knowledge that I was crossing the border in doing so and that they were actually Indians, not my compatriots. For my Kathmandu-born wife, India, however, seemed kind of alien to her. That’s until 2015 when she first flew to Kochi (Kerala) for a brief language course. Post-2015, we must have travelled together to various parts of India—it would be an overstatement to say the length and breadth of that mammoth nation, but of course from north to south and west to east—a dozen times or more. Over the years, both of us have found new things and have made new friends. Which India, which Nepal?In Nepal, and among many Nepalis, there are different Indias. For those born and grown up along the plains, one image of India is integral to their lives. Another India provides people from far-flung remote western districts with a means of livelihood. For those in Kathmandu and some hill regions, there is one India that harbours a dark malevolence. For some ultranationalists and a section of Nepali politicians, there is another India that is expansionist, a hegemon and a major threat to Nepal’s sovereignty. In India, and among many Indians, the case, however, seems to be a bit different. Those in New Delhi’s power corridors often see Nepal as their backyard. And there are Indians, the peoples, who either know or do not know about Nepal. Some of the remarks from fellow passengers I encountered during my recent trip: “I have been planning to worship at Pashupatinath temple; by the way, how far is Pokhara from Kathmandu?”, “Nepal itself is such a beautiful country and yet you come to India for a vacation?”, “Why do you have so many government changes so frequently? Who is the prime minister now?”, “Have been up to the border (Rupaidiha or Raxaul) but have never been to Kathmandu. I must visit Nepal.”Variables at playDifferent variables shape up, strengthen or weaken relations between any two countries. Policymakers and leadership, however, often tend to put excessive focus on some and completely ignore others, which may actually need more attention.The conduct of Nepali politicians and the Indian establishment’s tendency to view things through the warped prism often tend to make already challenging relations even worse. Amid the rapid flux in the region and the world, Nepal and India are likely to face more challenges and complexities, but in the larger interest of both countries, they must manage and address them in such a way that they do not derail the core relations.Kathmandu and New Delhi, in the past years, have been struggling to smooth out the irritants, but while doing so, both should not forget that the peoples of the two countries make the strongest linkage between these two civilisations. Any exercise by the leadership of either country to take the other head on at the expense of peoples will never allow the relations to be on an even keel. Even today, there are a number of genuine concerns of Nepalis visiting India vis-à-vis mobile connections and digital payments, even though they are, on paper, said to have been addressed. There is a need to sensitise and aware officials on both sides of the border when dealing with the peoples of the two countries. These are some issues that do not cost much but pay off immensely in the long run to strengthen relations. The Nepali leadership often tends to demonstrate proclivity to stoke hostility towards India, especially when they attempt “to settle a score” with New Delhi. The Indian establishment, which may comprise multiple constituents, including foreign policy mandarins, on the other hand, does not hesitate to sow the seeds of paranoia of losing Kathmandu’s “loyalty” to China. In the wake of recent events in the region, it must have dawned upon New Delhi that if it wants to earn the goodwill of its neighbouring states, it should invest in communities and peoples instead of individual leaders. The Nepali leadership, which is at present dealing with an unprecedented wrath of the public for the delivery deficit, will do well not to have their priorities misplaced.Nepalis here and thereIn 2016, when my wife, son and I arrived at Varkala in Kerala, the man who had come to pick us up at the railway station was a Nepali. He took us to the hotel we had booked, which was owned by a Nepali. In the next three days, we learned that every resort along the Varkala Beach had Nepalis—either managing or working.“We are vacationing in India without needing to speak any other language but Nepali,” quipped our son, then 11. “Just that they don’t give us SIM cards here!” ","summary":"In the first week of August, I was in India, on a second visit exactly a year after.

In the next three days, we learned that every resort along the Varkala Beach had Nepalis—either managing or working.“We are vacationing in India without needing to speak any other language but Nepali,” quipped our son, then 11. “Just that they don’t give us SIM cards here!” "},{"hash":"93f00b934b1cf0c1bec5041194c29800b1ccbd095e3c4a21469559b6eb32c18a","title":"floods-claim-more-lives-as-torrential-rain-pounds-central-europe","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/world/2024/09/16/floods-claim-more-lives-as-torrential-rain-pounds-central-europe","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/world/httpscloudfrontuseast2imagesarcpublishingcomreutersSY6G4XG5YNNDLDCZZGHEU6NLFE-1726458663.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1726444800000,"source":"kp","category":"world","content":"The death toll from flooding in central Europe rose to eight on Sunday as thousands of people were evacuated from their homes in the Czech Republic following days of torrential rain that caused rivers to burst their banks in several parts of the region.A low-pressure system named Boris has triggered downpours from Austria to Romania, leading to some of the worst flooding in nearly three decades in hard-hit areas in the Czech Republic and Poland.More rain and strong winds are forecast until at least Monday, though the rain eased on Sunday in Romania, which bore the brunt of flooding a day earlier.Thousands of homes have been damaged over the weekend, bridges swept away and at least 250,000 households - mainly in the Czech Republic - were affected by power cuts.One person drowned in southwestern Poland on Sunday, a firefighter taking part in rescue efforts was killed in Austria and two more people were killed in Romania, where the floods claimed four lives on Saturday.In Lower Austria, the province surrounding Vienna where government officials said the firefighter had died, authorities declared the area a disaster zone and warned against non-essential travel.A bridge collapsed in the historic Polish town of Glucholazy near the Czech border and local officials ordered evacuations early on Sunday.

The two works come after the twin successes of ‘Prayogshala’ and ‘The Nepal Nexus’. This time, his ‘Bhikshu, Byapar ra Bidroha’, and ‘Himalpari Ko Huri’ have been published by Kitab Publishers.These two books explore the historical relationship between Nepal, Tibet, and China. They span 1,500 years and detail the evolution of these ties up to the present day. The book was launched in the presence of four guest speakers: Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, CPN-UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, Rastriya Swatantra Party vice-chair Swarnim Waglé, and Lila Nyaichyai, an expert on Nepal-China ties.At the launch, Nyaichyai said, “A journalist has become a historian.” She praised the book for its account of the Tibet-Nepal relationship and its use of Nepal Bhasa and Tibetan language.Pokharel remarked that the books offered a multi-dimensional perspective on the Nepal-Tibet relationship, highlighting the economic highs and lows influenced by this connection. He also offered feedback to the author, noting that the book focused on the Kathmandu Valley–and perhaps the area under review could have been widened. Waglé meanwhile termed the book a ‘page-’turner. He praises the meticulous research, sources, citations, and interesting storytelling. Thapa provided a chapter-by-chapter review of both books. He emphasised the need for Nepal to leverage its relationships with its two neighbours, India and China, both of which are major players in the global economy. He also pointed out that Nepal has not made significant efforts to understand China and vice-versa. Thapa recommended that young people interested in economics and politics read these books.At the end of the event, writer Sharma thanked everyone present. He addressed the books’ shortcomings and asked for more feedback from readers. He said he wrote these books so that the youths can analyse Nepal’s past and understand the country’s present and future. He said he would be happy if the book served as a platform for discussions about Nepal’s role vis-a-vis the growing economies of India and China. At the end of the formal event at a jam-packed Yak and Yeti hall, Sharma was surrounded by a hoard of people wishing him to sign the books.

While nearly 20 bodies have been recovered so far, the rest of the passengers remain missing.

According to the Ministry of Health and Population’s record, nearly 100,000 survivors of road crashes have been treated in various hospitals and health centres across the country in one year.In its latest report, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 8,500 people die in road accidents in the country every year. Likewise, a study by the World Bank showed that Nepal has been facing an annual loss of nearly three percent of the national GDP due to road crashes.The petitioners have also called upon the government to recruit at least 7,000 additional traffic police personnel or traffic inspectors across the country, improve the quality of roads, and implement strict road safety laws, including mandatory use of motorcycle helmets.They have also called upon the government to set up vehicle fitness testing centres and introduce motor test certification, form a task force to review the national public transport policy, introduce an integrated and scientific transport based on a safe systems approach, enhance the capacity of driving schools, set standard for the quality of buses, conduct road network mapping and road safety audit across the country, among other measures.The petition has also called for setting up 24-hour CCTV surveillance on high-risk highways and arterial roads, enforcing laws against drink driving and use of substances while driving, setting up vehicle fitness testing centres in all major cities of the country, devising strategies and protocols to conduct the search, rescue, treatment and rehabilitation of victims in the aftermath of road crashes.The petitioners have also called upon Prime Minister Oli to direct the agencies concerned to introduce Star ratings of schools, roads, and vehicles based on road safety performance and introduce procedures to prioritise vulnerable road users, including pedestrians, cyclists, and wheelchair and white cane users.They have also called for introducing an international driving permit (IDP), revising the Health Insurance Act to cover the treatment of victims of road crashes, introducing unlimited insurance and free legal assistance for road crash victims, and ensuring living wages for transport workers along socially appropriate safety measures.The petitioners have said that enforcement of strong road safety measures will not only help the country's economic progress but it would also help promote tourism and give the country a positive image on the world stage.

However, rising temperatures caused by global warming have made protecting endangered species, such as snow leopards, a big challenge.The country has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half. According to a 2017 study by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DOHM), Nepal's average annual maximum temperature has risen by 0.056 degrees Celsius. The study shows most districts have witnessed increasing temperatures each year, with hill and mountain districts witnessing a faster rise compared to the Tarai districts.“Protecting livestock—mountain goats, horses, mules, and yaks—has become increasingly challenging for farmers in Mustang and other mountain districts, which have been hardest hit by the climate crisis,” said Lal Bahadur Gurung, an expert on snow leopards. ‘‘The rising temperatures have increased incidents of human-wildlife conflicts in mountainous regions, and livestock are getting killed by both common and snow leopards.”It is estimated that there are around 400 snow leopards in Nepal out of fewer than 4,000 worldwide. Experts say snow leopards sometimes raid livestock barns during heavy snowfalls when prey becomes scarce, especially as they age and become weak. During such raids, they kill dozens of animals at once. Also, rising temperatures due to climate change are driving common leopards to higher altitudes, further increasing the threat to livestock.Multiple stakeholders have set up mechanisms to protect endangered species like snow leopards by reducing human-wildlife conflicts. But affected livestock farmers complained that these efforts only add to their misery.“I got nothing from anyone—not from the insurance company, the local government, or any of the agencies involved in snow leopard conservation,” complained Santosh Pariyar, another resident from ward 2 of Gharapjhong Rural Municipality who lost 27 mountain goats in a snow leopard attack. “The insurance company wanted photos of the snow leopard carrying off my goats, along with tags as proof. Local officials asked me to show where the dead goats were buried.”Many livestock farmers the Post spoke to voiced similar frustrations, saying the mechanisms meant to reduce human-wildlife conflicts are overly problematic and too mechanical, which is fuelling growing resentment towards snow leopards.“Who would not be angry when dozens of livestock are killed at once,” said Anil Adhikari, executive director of the Teka Samuha Nepal, a non-profit that runs a community-based snow leopard conservation project in six local units in Mustang.“Unless we make the mechanisms set up for lessening human-wildlife conflict more farmer-friendly and provide compensation on time, we cannot expect the intended results.”Adhikari claimed that retaliatory killings of snow leopards, which used to be a major challenge to conservation efforts, have declined thanks to years of awareness efforts. He also said that farmers' growing frustration with the authorities' lackadaisical approach to compensation is a lingering issue. “Getting compensation from insurance companies and other authorities concerned is too difficult,” said Niraj Thakali, a local from Jomsom, Mustang. “First of all, most herders cannot gather all the required proof—photos of the leopard attack, insurance tags, and so on. Second, the compensation amount is so small that selling the meat of the dead animals is often more profitable than filing an insurance claim. And even when you file a claim, it takes months to receive the payment.” Thakali, an activist involved in snow leopard conservation, said that he too lost three horses a few months ago, but chose not to file an insurance claim, as he knows it is not easy to complete all bureaucratic procedures.“There is a growing awareness among locals that we shouldn’t kill snow leopards, even if they prey on our livestock,” said Sabi Thakali, a local from Thini village in ward 5 of Gharapjhong Rural Municipality in Mustang. “The authorities need to step up and provide compensation promptly, if they want us to continue protecting these animals.” ","summary":"Til Bahadur Pariyar, a resident of Marpha in ward 2 of Gharapjhong Rural Municipality in the mountain district of Mustang, complained that snow leopards killed 60 of his mountain goats over the last three years.A few months ago, he lost three horses to a common leopard, which has been moving into the mountainous region lately due to the warming climate.“Earlier, we only had to guard our livestock against snow leopards, but now common leopards also kill our animals,” complained Pariyar. “Many livestock farmers have already abandoned the profession due to the growing threat from predators—snow leopards and common leopards.”Nepal is among the 12 countries that are home to snow leopards and has committed to protecting the species, its prey, and its habitats. However, rising temperatures caused by global warming have made protecting endangered species, such as snow leopards, a big challenge.The country has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half. According to a 2017 study by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DOHM), Nepal's average annual maximum temperature has risen by 0.056 degrees Celsius. The study shows most districts have witnessed increasing temperatures each year, with hill and mountain districts witnessing a faster rise compared to the Tarai districts.“Protecting livestock—mountain goats, horses, mules, and yaks—has become increasingly challenging for farmers in Mustang and other mountain districts, which have been hardest hit by the climate crisis,” said Lal Bahadur Gurung, an expert on snow leopards. ‘‘The rising temperatures have increased incidents of human-wildlife conflicts in mountainous regions, and livestock are getting killed by both common and snow leopards.”It is estimated that there are around 400 snow leopards in Nepal out of fewer than 4,000 worldwide.

Harnessing waste biomass could cut the country’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by up to 52 percent and meet up to 12 percent of current energy consumption, according to the paper entitled ‘Possibilities and challenges for converting waste biomass into fuel, feed, and fertiliser in Nepal’.Most of Nepal’s waste biomass is used conventionally, such as for kitchen fuel and animal feed, without proper valorisation. This is a pressing issue as open dumping and burning, particularly of municipal waste, is a common practice in Nepal, according to the paper, with detrimental effects on the overall ecosystem.“Our study estimates the potential of about 89 million tonnes of waste biomass annually in Nepal, mainly from the agriculture, municipal, livestock, fowl, and human sectors,” said Sagar Kafle, assistant professor at the Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University.“We have revealed the potential at the sub-national level in Nepal, highlighting its possibilities and challenges for converting the fuel, feed, and fertilisers,” said Kafle, who is currently pursuing PhD at Auburn University, US.The paper estimates that through the conversion of waste biomass, Nepal can produce about 1.7 to 5.0 million tonnes of pellet or briquette and biochar, 1.7 to 5.1 million tonnes of feed block, 129 to 387 million cubic metres of biogas, and 0.6 to 1.9 million tonnes of fertiliser.“These valuable products can have significant environmental and economic benefits,” the paper said.Waste biomass is generated from different sources, such as forestry residue, agriculture crop residue, municipal organic waste, and livestock waste. Improper management of such residue and waste negatively impacts overall biodiversity, a growing global concern. For example, the poor handling and management of municipal solid waste, mainly generated from the urban sector, pollutes the surroundings and impacts overall biodiversity, including human health. Its management is one of the significant challenges for the relevant authorities, as it needs resources.Municipal solid waste, comprising more than half of organic waste in developing countries, is being dumped and burned openly in Nepal.Similarly, open burning of crop residues, especially paddy straw, is practised in Nepal, resulting in air pollution. This practice is particularly prominent in the Tarai, where combined harvesters scatter straw across the fields, making collection impractical. Farmers often burn the straw as they find it economically unviable to collect and meet the next cropping season. Livestock manures generate methane during decomposition, contributing to global warming. However, anaerobic digestion technology could trap and utilise this gas as energy.Also, improper management of human waste—urine and faeces—pollutes soil and groundwater, affecting human health. Although the country has declared itself free from open defecation, dumping raw sewage and septic tank waste into rivers is common in Nepal. Due to the lack of proper conversion knowledge and technology and the unavailability of status data, the waste biomass is improperly managed or conventionally used in many developing countries. The conventional use of waste biomass is less efficient, hazardous to the environment, and does not generate economic growth. For example, using dry dung cake instead of biogas for cooking fuel is less efficient, degrades indoor air quality, and impacts human health. The lack of data generation, consumption, and availability hinders policymaking and planning for the biomass-based industry.Some houses also have toilets connected to biogas plants. In the fiscal year 2020-21 alone, about 3,975 biogas plants were installed in Nepal. This shows that waste biomass is utilised in modern ways, such as producing biogas. However, the majority is still untapped and is conventionally used or managed poorly.Proper utilisation of such waste biomass needs quantification at the subnational level, which will help develop innovative industries for sustainable development, such as by enhancing the local economy, creating jobs and increasing the share of renewable energy.The study’s findings are significant and show enormous waste potential in the Tarai, especially in Morang district of Koshi Province. Prof Sushil Adhikari, co-author of the study and professor at Auburn University, highlighted the opportunities for producing fuel, feed, and fertilisers from such waste biomass. “The pellets and briquettes produced from waste biomass could effectively replace coal in thermal power industries such as brick and cement. It can reduce the country’s carbon dioxide emissions by up to 52 percent and meet up to 12 percent of current energy consumption.” He elaborated on the benefits of producing a densified total mixed ration using crop residue. “In Nepal, where mass transport systems are lacking, and transport costs are high, such densified feed blocks could be a game changer in feed industries.” Further, biogas from waste biomass could reduce the dependency on imported LPG fuel and produce nutrient-rich fertilisers as by-products.“The country lacks location-specific data on the potential and availability of waste biomass, which is important for planning waste-based industries,” said Prajal Pradhan, the co-author of the study and assistant professor at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands. Pradhan highlighted lack of mass transport infrastructures and networks and the challenges due to the topography and terrain, which create difficulties in transporting raw materials and final products. “Uncertainty in investment and market, insufficient management regulations and policies, and poor intersectoral coordination are added problems. These challenges need to be addressed to promote waste biomass-based industries in Nepal,” said Pradhan.

But soon they met Prakash, or Paka, a shadow figure living in oblivion for over three decades in the valley after being lost from Kathmandu. He had only hazy memories of his family and home in Jhapa, and his real name—Kale Tamang. The Herne Katha team soon began tracing his footsteps back to Jhapa. Along the journey, Paka’s memories of his childhood, his family and his home came back alive in bits and pieces. Ultimately, he found his family back—in Jhapa, where his sisters lived, and in Bhojpur, where his parents and brothers had resettled. On the eighth day of its premiere, as “The Lost Years” had reached 8.7 million views on YouTube, Paka had risen as a folk hero and the Herne Katha team garnered accolades and criticisms aplenty. A curious mixture of his destiny and Herne Katha’s storytelling helped him find home. But long after Herne Katha stopped rolling, his story continues to unravel. From a story, he is slowly metamorphosing into a content as he is being pushed towards uncharted territories. The return from social media-fed stardom to reality is rather troublesome and tragic—as we have seen in the case of the young Sachin Pariyar. Known for his quirky humour and mediocre singing, Sachin became an overnight sensation. Soon, his broken family became a feed for content creators; his father, nicknamed Kaloute, became a celebrated villain; and the child was made to beg on the streets of Kathmandu. The estrangementAs Paka metamorphoses into a subject for content creators, he is quickly losing the plot of his story. As YouTubers seek newness in their content, Paka will be encouraged to fabricate his hardships and seek financial support—things he had hardly ever done before. In no time, having repeated the fabrications on camera umpteen times, he will learn to believe them, even become obsessed with them. Questions about the inconsistencies in his plotline will follow, and he will have to supplement fabrications with lies. In no time, Paka will have lost touch with his story. Unless another good samaritan jumps in to save Paka from the viral infection of social media-driven stardom, this is more or less his trajectory in the next few weeks. There are some tell-tale signs of Paka’s downfall already: His parents have already started crying in front of YouTubers; his brother has already started reciting stale chutkilas; local politicians have offered him land to build a home; provincial and federal government representatives have promised to help him; and the common public have begun garlanding him and offering him money. The man who had mastered the art of living in the mountains will soon be tutored in the art of lying in front of the camera. Negotiating the journey from innocence to experience is often more difficult than spending cold winter nights in the company of yaks and sheep. Finding home should never be accompanied by the loss of self, but that is what happens when the story loses its plot. The spectacleThe history of the media is a story of fabrications. Folklores and myths, poetry and prose, or stories and reels, all depend on some bit of fabrication by the media that bear them—oral, visual, or tactile. The heroes we celebrate or the villains we loathe have all come to us through some sort of fabrications by the media ecosystem. From cave paintings' exaggeration of Neanderthal life to ChatGPT's fabrication about the books this author has not written, media of all forms exist in the interstitial space between truth and falsity. No wonder that Bidhya Chapagain and her Herne Katha team were criticised for \"fabricating\" Paka's story of hardship. Rather than wait for over a year to sell his story, we are told, the makers should have yelled about it into the ears of the authorities—meaning the exploitative system—for punitive action. If nothing, they should have at least asked difficult questions to Paka's master who had kept him without pay for over three decades.In the normative sense of action-oriented journalism, the criticisms against Herne Katha are not unfounded. A deeper probing into what led to Paka's misery would certainly have led to greater accountability from his master and the systems that disallow people like him from finding their way home. But not every story that involves a camera, a voiceover and a character is journalism, much less investigative journalism. Though with backgrounds in journalism, the Herne Katha team, in identifying themselves as storytellers, have not, at least now, made any serious claim to being activist-journalists. Rather, their interest seems to be in bearing witness and telling a good story. Everybody loves a good story, no matter whether it is that of selling dreams or shedding tears. Unless they resort to sensationalism and journalistic grandstanding, a bit of melodrama narrating the bittersweet story of a man lost in the mountains for 30 years is no big deal. But Paka's story is quickly becoming a public spectacle, and there is a risk of him losing his very being.   ","summary":"A year and a half ago, Bidhya Chapagain and her team of Herne Katha (Seeing Stories) visited the distant Chum Valley in Gorkha District to follow the story of Phunjo Lama.

What started as a few friendly messages on social media quickly took a dark turn when the man demanded nude photos of her, which she refused to send.Unfazed, he started sending her unsolicited explicit images of himself. He then began tracking her online activity, leaving threatening messages, and eventually, he found her home address. “I would receive messages saying he was watching me, that he knew where my son went to school,” Maya told the Post. Despite blocking him multiple times, the stalker always found a way to reappear, using different accounts to harass her. Fearing for her nine-year-old son’s safety, she finally mustered the courage to file a complaint with the Cyber Bureau of Nepal Police 15 days ago.Since informing the stalker that she had taken legal action, he has not contacted her again, but the experience has left her feeling paranoid and anxious. She now fears leaving her home and hesitates to go online. “I just want to feel safe again, but I’m not sure if that’s possible anymore,” Maya says.Maya’s ordeal speaks volumes about how violence against women is no longer confined to physical spaces but has increasingly infiltrated the digital world in the form of online abuse, from revenge porn and bullying to sexual harassment, trolling, fraud, and blackmail.The severity of this issue becomes even clearer with data from the Cyber Bureau. In just under two months of the fiscal year 2024-25, the bureau has already recorded 882 cases of cybercrimes involving women. Looking back at previous years, the figures paint a troubling picture. In the fiscal year 2022-23, there were 9,013 reported cybercrime cases, with 4,590 filed by women. The period also saw 130 cases involving minor girls. The following year, 2023-24, witnessed a dramatic rise in the number of cases involving women to 8,745 and those involving minors to 382. This represents an increase of approximately 90.52 percent in cyber violence cases reported by women from 2022-23 to 2023-24.As the country entered a new fiscal year, the trend of online violence continues, with the bureau already reporting 35 cases involving minor girls and 882 cases involving adult women. However, these numbers alone do not capture the full extent of women’s and girls’ vulnerability in the digital space. Traditional beliefs, discrimination, and the normalisation of such behaviour, along with the fear that exposing abuse will shame them and their families, often lead to many cases going unreported.Rita, a 27-year-old woman, from Sunsari whom the Post is identifying with a pseudonym, is one such victim. She never imagined that a relationship she once cherished would end up destroying her life. After a difficult breakup, her ex-partner with whom she had a live-in relationship, sought revenge by sharing intimate videos and photos of her online with her family, friends, and relatives in 2022.For the next six months, her ex continued to sexually harass her through social media. The abuse only ceased after she attempted suicide, which resulted in a three-week hospitalisation.“Even after all this happened, my family refused to help me file a complaint. My relatives even mocked me, saying that I had already done intimate things during the live-in relationship. They said he wasn’t physically hurting or abusing me, so I should just get over it”, says Rita.According to a UN report based on studies in 10 countries, an estimated 95 percent of aggressive behaviour, harassment, abusive language, and degrading images online are directed at women, and they often come from partners or ex-partners.A year has passed for Rita, but the emotional scars remain, and she continues to struggle with depression.Many in Nepal, like Rita’s relatives, downplay the impact of online harassment, dismissing it as “just virtual, not physical.” However, a UN report titled ‘Combating Online Violence Against Women & Girls: A Worldwide Wake-Up Call,’ published by the UN Broadband Commission in 2015, tells a different story. It argues that ‘cyber touch’ can be as damaging as physical touch, suggesting that online abuse can be as bad as domestic violence or sexual assault.Now, as women across Nepal are celebrating Teej, many find themselves facing online violence. They are subjected to a barrage of hate speech simply for enjoying themselves.In recent years, the sight of women dancing, singing, drinking, and celebrating during Teej has sparked outrage among certain segments of society, particularly men who see these activities as a challenge to traditional gender roles. Social media trolls have seized on the opportunity to attack and criticise what they consider ‘inappropriate behaviour, clothing, and dance.’“Every year, it’s the same story,” says Ankita Chapagain, a 40-year-old from Kathmandu. “As soon as videos of women enjoying Teej and dancing go online, the hate comments start pouring in. We’re called names, our morals are questioned, and we’re blamed for the supposed degradation of society.”This animosity extends beyond anonymous trolls; it mirrors a deeper social unease with women’s independence and the pervasive misogyny and patriarchy in our culture. “It’s as if they can’t stand to see women happy and celebrating on their own terms,” Chapagain adds.The problem intensifies during elections, with female politicians facing significant online abuse. An analysis conducted by Panos South Asia reveals that insults and hate speech are the most common attacks on female politicians.A joint statement by the United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Violence against Women and Freedom of Expression says online violence against women can “chill and disrupt the online participation of women journalists, activists, human rights defenders, artists, and other public figures and private individuals” —which underscores the severe impact of growing cyber violence.So, how well-prepared are the institutions responsible for addressing this issue, like the Cyber Bureau? The answer seems to be, not very well.Superintendent of Police Deepak Raj Awasthi, spokesperson, and information officer of the Cyber Bureau, told the Post last month that the bureau is struggling with both understaffing and underfunding.The gap between the rise in cybercrimes and the lack of resources leaves the virtual realm a dangerous space, especially for girls and women who are already vulnerable due to unsafe physical environments, pervasive misogyny, and systemic discrimination. ","summary":"Maya, a 36-year-old single mother from Babarmahal, Kathmandu never imagined that a polite rejection on Facebook two months ago would spiral into a living nightmare.Maya (her real name has been changed to protect her identity) became the target of an online stalker after she rejected a man’s advances. What started as a few friendly messages on social media quickly took a dark turn when the man demanded nude photos of her, which she refused to send.Unfazed, he started sending her unsolicited explicit images of himself. He then began tracking her online activity, leaving threatening messages, and eventually, he found her home address. “I would receive messages saying he was watching me, that he knew where my son went to school,” Maya told the Post. Despite blocking him multiple times, the stalker always found a way to reappear, using different accounts to harass her. Fearing for her nine-year-old son’s safety, she finally mustered the courage to file a complaint with the Cyber Bureau of Nepal Police 15 days ago.Since informing the stalker that she had taken legal action, he has not contacted her again, but the experience has left her feeling paranoid and anxious. She now fears leaving her home and hesitates to go online. “I just want to feel safe again, but I’m not sure if that’s possible anymore,” Maya says.Maya’s ordeal speaks volumes about how violence against women is no longer confined to physical spaces but has increasingly infiltrated the digital world in the form of online abuse, from revenge porn and bullying to sexual harassment, trolling, fraud, and blackmail.The severity of this issue becomes even clearer with data from the Cyber Bureau. In just under two months of the fiscal year 2024-25, the bureau has already recorded 882 cases of cybercrimes involving women. Looking back at previous years, the figures paint a troubling picture. In the fiscal year 2022-23, there were 9,013 reported cybercrime cases, with 4,590 filed by women. The period also saw 130 cases involving minor girls. The following year, 2023-24, witnessed a dramatic rise in the number of cases involving women to 8,745 and those involving minors to 382. This represents an increase of approximately 90.52 percent in cyber violence cases reported by women from 2022-23 to 2023-24.As the country entered a new fiscal year, the trend of online violence continues, with the bureau already reporting 35 cases involving minor girls and 882 cases involving adult women. However, these numbers alone do not capture the full extent of women’s and girls’ vulnerability in the digital space. Traditional beliefs, discrimination, and the normalisation of such behaviour, along with the fear that exposing abuse will shame them and their families, often lead to many cases going unreported.Rita, a 27-year-old woman, from Sunsari whom the Post is identifying with a pseudonym, is one such victim. She never imagined that a relationship she once cherished would end up destroying her life. After a difficult breakup, her ex-partner with whom she had a live-in relationship, sought revenge by sharing intimate videos and photos of her online with her family, friends, and relatives in 2022.For the next six months, her ex continued to sexually harass her through social media. The abuse only ceased after she attempted suicide, which resulted in a three-week hospitalisation.“Even after all this happened, my family refused to help me file a complaint. My relatives even mocked me, saying that I had already done intimate things during the live-in relationship. They said he wasn’t physically hurting or abusing me, so I should just get over it”, says Rita.According to a UN report based on studies in 10 countries, an estimated 95 percent of aggressive behaviour, harassment, abusive language, and degrading images online are directed at women, and they often come from partners or ex-partners.A year has passed for Rita, but the emotional scars remain, and she continues to struggle with depression.Many in Nepal, like Rita’s relatives, downplay the impact of online harassment, dismissing it as “just virtual, not physical.” However, a UN report titled ‘Combating Online Violence Against Women & Girls: A Worldwide Wake-Up Call,’ published by the UN Broadband Commission in 2015, tells a different story. It argues that ‘cyber touch’ can be as damaging as physical touch, suggesting that online abuse can be as bad as domestic violence or sexual assault.Now, as women across Nepal are celebrating Teej, many find themselves facing online violence. They are subjected to a barrage of hate speech simply for enjoying themselves.In recent years, the sight of women dancing, singing, drinking, and celebrating during Teej has sparked outrage among certain segments of society, particularly men who see these activities as a challenge to traditional gender roles.

A discussion among my college peers about this work sparked my interest, prompting me to buy and read it.‘Santapko Dhoon’ is a collection of thirteen short stories that explores often silenced and overlooked aspects of Nepali society. It gives a voice to the voiceless and sheds light on social issues rarely addressed.From childhood nostalgia and love to societal issues, the recurring themes in this short story collection are intense, making it a compelling read.The book starts with ‘Hattichap Chappal,’ a story that uses a childhood memory of unreliable slippers to explore life’s unpredictability. The protagonist's inability to join a dictation competition with his crush, all due to a small slipper malfunction, illustrates how seemingly insignificant events can be important.The story revolves around a missed opportunity and how something minor, such as broken footwear, can impact someone’s future. I was moved by how the character and his crush couldn’t attend the dictation competition simply because of a snapped slipper strap. Missing out on a meaningful shared moment with someone you care about can be disheartening, especially due to an unforeseen circumstance beyond your control. Attending the event together could have been a chance to bond, create memories, and possibly grow closer.Even though it’s just a broken slipper strap, it feels like a metaphor for the obstacles standing between you and the relationship you long for. The disappointment is tangible. Thapa dramatises the absurd by skillfully drawing emotions from everyday objects, using his ability to turn the mundane into something emotionally charged.The fourth short story, ‘Vaginal Trauma’, stood out to me for its raw and intimate exploration of love, bodily autonomy, and societal expectations. It simultaneously critiques patriarchal norms surrounding relationships and sexual consent. The story delves into unspoken trauma and masculine entitlement, offering a powerful narrative that resonates with the complexities of contemporary gender dynamics.‘Vaginal Trauma’ portrays a young couple whose relationship is put at risk when the boy pressures the girl for premarital sex. His frustration with her refusal leads him to contemplate ending the relationship, reflecting a tendency to reduce love and commitment to physical satisfaction. As a young girl, I question whether love should be viewed simply as an emotion tied to fulfilling bodily desires or as something deeper and more meaningful.In a moment of vulnerability, the girl reveals her traumatic past—an accident that caused a vaginal injury, with her doctor advising against sexual activity. This marks a pivotal moment in the story, highlighting the boy’s insensitivity and bringing attention to the societal pressures placed on women to meet sexual expectations, regardless of their circumstances or well-being.The boy, who turns a deaf ear to the girl’s repeated “No,” symbolises disregard for women’s bodily autonomy. The author portrays him as a representation of men who, under the guise of love, exploit women’s bodies for their pleasure, ignoring consent. Through this character, the story powerfully critiques how love is often manipulated to justify violating a woman’s agency.Another short story, ‘Gajal Bechne Keti’, discusses survival, resilience, and societal neglect. The protagonist, a young girl selling gajal, symbolises the countless marginalised women who must endure a harsh urban environment to survive.Thapa explores the theme of poverty by juxtaposing it with the allure and superficial beauty of the gajal she sells, emphasising the contrast between outward appearances and the hidden struggles of those living in poverty. This contrast exposes the harsh realities faced by marginalised individuals, who are often forced to mask their hardships behind a facade of beauty and normalcy.In the story, the gajal is a powerful symbol. Intended to enhance beauty and adorn the eyes, it ironically contrasts with the protagonist’s life, marked by the harsh realities of street survival. While she sells a product designed to beautify others, her existence is marred by struggle and deprivation.In ‘Vittaka Kaan’, a mother uncovers her husband’s affair with her daughter-in-law. This shocking discovery triggers a series of tragic events, culminating in the mother writing a letter to her son, a soldier stationed in Kargil. In her letter, she details the betrayal and requests that Mamta, another illiterate girl, be considered a replacement.Reading this short story was deeply affecting. The idea of a father-in-law having an affair with his son’s wife is shocking and almost unimaginable. The story leaves ambiguous whether the wife was coerced into the relationship or if she willingly succumbed to her own and his desires. This ambiguity adds to the emotional weight and complexity of the narrative, challenging readers to grapple with uncomfortable questions about consent and betrayal.The mother’s discovery of incestuous relations within her family and the personal shock causes her to commit suicide by jumping into the Seti River. This act of taking her own life seems to symbolise a woman’s ultimate surrender to both personal and societal pressures, highlighting the oppressive weight of deeply rooted patriarchy. Her tragic decision shows how patriarchal norms can lead to devastating outcomes for women, reflecting their limited agency and the overwhelming burdens they often face.However, Thapa’s portrayal of tragic endings, such as characters committing suicide in response to societal shame or personal despair, raises questions. While these narratives are evocative and emotional, some readers may find the reliance on tragic endings as a resolution slightly overused or unconvincing. Another narrative, ‘Birya Daan’, offers a critical look at forced marriages and the drastic actions a woman might resort to to assert her independence in a society where traditional norms frequently limit personal choices. In this story, her former lover and current husband symbolise two opposing influences: her unmet emotional desires and the societal expectations placed upon her.The woman’s choice to sleep with her former lover while her husband was away was a bold act of defiance against the limitations of her forced marriage and a direct response to her parents’ refusal to allow her to marry the person she loves.As Thapa’s debut book, it deserves praise for exploring often-overlooked aspects of feminine existence and highlighting frequently marginalised and invisible issues. While Thapa’s stories are impactful, their brevity might be a drawback. The concise nature sometimes makes it seem like Thapa is trying too hard to address themes of sexuality, gender, and societal issues, which can come across as forced.Despite his male perspective, Thapa critiques societal norms restricting women’s choices and autonomy. The societal issues highlighted in his stories are significant and warrant more attention in our society and the literary world.Santapko DhoonAuthor: Ashok ThapaPublisher: Page TurnerYear: 2022Pages: 142 ","summary":"I had never encountered topics like vaginal trauma, toxic masculinity, incest, or adultery in any book by a Nepali author until I read ‘Santapko Dhoon’ by Ashok Thapa.

Addressing the committee members, Oli said that the cooperatives that are being run lawfully can still do a great service. “It is the presence of some people with ill motives that has sullied the whole sector,” Oli said.On Thursday, Minister for Home Affairs Ramesh Lekhak and Home Secretary Gokarna Mani Duwadi attended the panel’s 61st meeting. On the occasion, panel members urged the minister and secretary to arrest the culprits of the cooperatives scam who are on the run. The probe panel, formed on May 28 with a four-point terms of reference (ToR), had its tenure extended by 15 days after it was unable to complete its duty in the given three months. The committee is working to submit its report before the new deadline.The committee was formed to conduct a study and make recommendations on resolving legal and institutional issues facing the cooperatives as well as on the regulation, supervision, and transparency of their financial systems.Likewise, the panel will recommend ways to safeguard depositors’ savings, investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives and fast-track the return of deposits. The cooperatives linked with the funding of the now-defunct Gorkha Media Network were also to be probed as per the ToR.The probe panel was constituted after pressure from the Nepali Congress, which was then the main opposition party. The Congress, accusing Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) President Rabi Lamichhane as one of the main culprits in the cooperatives scam, had asked for such a committee’s formation. The committee, while summoning 50 people with suspicious roles in the cooperatives scam, had also questioned Lamichhane and hinted of his involvement. Lamichhane was the managing director of Gorkha Media Network before joining politics in June 2022. His partner Gitendra Babu Rai, who is believed to be hiding in Malaysia, was the chair of the media company. The company had redirected money from the various cooperatives to run the Galaxy 4k television channel under the network.Meanwhile, as the parliamentary special committee is about to complete its work, new cases of political leaders’ involvement in cooperatives fraud continue to emerge.The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police is looking into the alleged fraud involving the Miteri Savings and Credit Cooperative, which is connected to Nepali Congress Vice-president and former law minister Dhan Raj Gurung, and his former wife, Jyoti Gurung. CIB spokesperson Hobindra Bogati said a complaint was filed against the cooperative’s employees and management, and preliminary investigations have started. “We will investigate how the funds were misused and determine who was involved,” Bogati told the Post. “At present, we are focusing on investigating employees and members of the Miteri management.”Bogati said they are yet to investigate persons individually.After the cooperative’s chairman, Kumbharaj Gurung, complained to the Department of Cooperatives last month, alleging that Jyoti Gurung, the general manager, embezzled Rs12.5 million, the Congress vice-president also came under question. Gurung denies his involvement in the scam, arguing that his former wife with whom he no longer has contact, had misappropriated the money, and so he could not be held accountable. Despite Gurung’s claim that he separated from his wife in 2019, cooperative chair Kumbharaj reported to law enforcement agencies that the lawmaker continued to pay off the debt in his wife’s name until last year. Various copies of the vouchers Dhan Raj Gurung reportedly used to deposit money into the cooperative’s account have surfaced on various media outlets.Upon reaching the cooperative’s office at Mahalaxmi, Lalitpur on Friday, special committee members discussed the issue with Kumbharaj Gurung, the chair. After being charged with embezzling the cooperatives funds, Dhan Raj Gurung, speaking in Parliament on September 10, called for a proper probe so as to clear his name. The special committee, whose extended timeframe expires on September 22, inspected three government bodies and 13 cooperative institutions on Thursday. It visited the Department of Cooperatives, the Cooperatives Training Centre at New Baneshwar, and the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee Office at Buddhanagar. The committee also examined several cooperatives, including Swarnalaxmi, Sumeru, Civil, Gautamshri, Kantipur Cooperative, Nepal Cooperative Financial Institution, Miteri, Laligurans, Gorkha Savings, Shiva Shikar, and Nagarik Bikas Cooperative.CPN-UML leader Rishikesh Pokharel, the chair of the Public Accounts Committee of the federal parliament, has also been accused of mishandling cooperatives funds.Pokharel’s wife, Anjala Koirala, was once on the board of Umagauri Agriculture Cooperative directors. She is accused of embezzling Rs120 million with the organisation located in Karsiya Bazar, Ward 4 of Dhanpal Nath Rural Municipality in Morang. The cooperative is now in distress.Pokharel has denounced such allegations through social media posts. “I express regret over the misleading reports, propagated by some corrupt intermediaries and certain media outlets, aimed at character assassination,” Pokharel said in a statement on Thursday.

Of late, lawmakers from the two communist parties are engaged in heated exchanges in the House of Representatives. They have intensified attacks against each other mainly after UML Secretary Yogesh Bhattarai, addressing the House meeting on August 28, termed the Maoist insurgency ‘violence’ while Maoists call it the People’s War. Maoist Centre lawmakers promptly objected to Bhattarai’s use of the word and demanded the Speaker’s ruling to expunge the ‘unparliamentary word’ from parliamentary records. However, Speaker Devraj Ghimire, who got elected from the UML, ruled on Wednesday that the term wasn’t unparliamentary so there was no need to remove it from the records.The issue has now become a major irritant between the two largest communist parties. A parliamentary party meeting of the CPN (Maoist Centre) on Friday decided to continue its House obstruction until the word ‘violence’ is removed from record.Oli, on the other hand, claimed that his party, UML, has the potential to win a single majority in the elections to be held in 2027 and urged the party leaders and cadres to jointly prepare for that. A central secretariat meeting of the party on Friday approved an action plan to build the party into a ‘decisive national force’ from the next general elections.“We have a solid foundation to make the mission-2084 [2027] successful by winning a majority in the elections,” Oli said at the party function in Kathmandu on Saturday. “If mission-2084 does not succeed, then no one will know what happens after 2084 BS. No one knows what changes will happen and who will be thrown where.”Oli claimed that the Maoist Centre, Dahal’s party which is now a distant third force, will further shrink after the new elections. He went on to say that the Maoist Centre could lose half its proportional votes from its last count of over a million and might struggle to become a national party from next elections.“In their first election, the Maoists received 3.1 million votes. By next elections, they received only 1.4 million votes. In the third, they received 1.3 million votes. Last elections, they received over 1.1 million votes in total,” Oli said, citing a newspaper report. “By the next elections, they could receive around 400,000 to 500,000 votes. They will struggle to become a national party.”Then the prime minister took a jibe at the monarchists saying that a large force was now active against the new constitution of Nepal.Some forces lobbying for the reinstatement of Hindu kingdom in the country are regrouping of late. Durga Prasai, a controversial medical entrepreneur from Oli’s hometown Jhapa, is one leading such movement. Oli once nominated Prasai as a UML central committee member. He was sacked after he started attacking Oli and other UML leaders. Prasai has not stopped attacking Nepali leaders, mainly from the old parties, but the UML has been his unmistakable target.“Some reactionary forces are trying to weaken the UML in a bid to complicate the situation. We are surrounded by reactionary elements and those who are against this constitution,” he said. Stating that there was an unprecedented build-up of support for a feudal, despotic and authoritarian monarchy, Oli said: “Unknowingly, some people are trying to create a negative atmosphere. Instead of following truth and facts, they have resorted to lies, illusions, conspiracies and tricks.”Oli also alerted his party workers to the elements allegedly trying to disrupt the law and order situation.Oli then attacked new political forces such as the Rastriya Swatantra Party, the Janamat Party and the Nagarik Unmukti Party. Oli described them as forces having grown overnight to eat the pie of old forces.He urged party members to remain vigilant as the new parties had taken away votes from the UML’s bank.“Where did our votes go last election? The groups that did not exist earlier were born and ate the rice from our plates. How did the rice get into their mouths? That’s why we have to be watchful,” said Oli.Once coalition partners, the UML and the Rastriya Swatantra Party are now at a verbal war in Parliament, especially after Oli’s party proposed unseating Deputy Speaker Indira Rana. Rana, who was elected from the RSP, has landed in a controversy after revelation that she requested the Kathmandu-based Embassy of the United States to expedite visa interviews for five individuals unrelated to her office. UML first raised the issue in Parliament and asked Rana to resign as deputy Speaker alleging her misconduct.The prime minister also criticised Balendra Shah, the mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan City, on Saturday.He called the mayor “a boy who speaks randomly”. “A new boy came to the scene suddenly. He speaks randomly, like a crazy person but some say he must not be touched. People asked us not to touch him because he has a strong support base. If we don’t correct him, he will continue his propaganda against us,” Oli said, urging his supporters to counter the negative messaging against the party.In June first week, Mayor Shah accused UML chair Oli of committing ‘policy corruption’ while trying to swap the land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in Jhapa. The same month, the mayor and UML leaders clashed over jurisdiction as the metropolis expanded a sidewalk in the New Road area.The mayor and UML leaders are once again at loggerheads over implementing a Supreme Court verdict that prohibits construction on an additional 20 metres on either side of a river in Kathmandu Valley. Shah often criticises Oli and the UML through social media posts and UML cadres have been countering him. Large numbers of social media users seem to be supporting Shah while criticising the establishment and traditional forces.The UML is a party with a large number of cadres equipped with a mobile phone, said Oli. “Why aren't our people coming out and writing against our opponents?” ","summary":"In one address at a function on Saturday, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli fired salvos at the CPN (Maoist Centre), supporters of monarchy, the political forces that emerged from the 2022 elections and Kathmandu mayor Balendra Shah.Oli and his party CPN-UML are engaged in a tussle with these four forces—the main opposition Maoist Centre, people campaigning for the restoration of monarchy that was abolished in 2008, new political parties and Kathmandu’s independent mayor for various reasons, mainly after Oli became the prime minister in mid-July.Oli didn’t say anything against the Nepali Congress, the UML’s main competitor but now a partner in the current coalition government.The Maoist party and its leaders have become aggressive against the UML, particularly after Oli pulled out of the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government in July and became prime minister with the support of Congress.

After months of heated debate, the ruling parties now argue that Rana’s action violated the ethical standards outlined in Article 91 of the Constitution of Nepal, and are pushing for her removal.Some UML lawmakers, speaking in the House of Representatives, have called for her removal, accusing her of writing to the US embassy directly, bypassing proper government channels.According to reports, Rana did not even personally know some individuals for whom she requested interview dates at the embassy.“We have not reached any conclusion on removing the deputy speaker,” said UML General Secretary Shankar Pokhrel after the party’s secretariat meeting. According to Pokharel, the issue was discussed in the meeting but there was no clear consensus on how to proceed. “Unlike how the issue has come out in the media, we have not reached a conclusion,” he said.The Nepali Congress, the largest party and ruling coalition member, has also demanded Rana’s resignation citing the moral responsibility of holding the post. Should she refuse to quit, both the UML and the Congress have reached an understanding to remove her through a two-thirds majority of the House of Representatives. However, internal divisions within the Congress and hesitation among other fringe parties have delayed action.While the two largest parties are rooting for her resignation, both Rana and the Rastriya Swatantra Party have resisted. The RSP has admitted that Rana made a mistake by writing to the embassy, but questioned why the ruling parties have revived the issue after 19 months.Meanwhile, the third largest party, the CPN (Maoist Centre), has opposed the big parties’ plan to remove Rana. Following a parliamentary party meeting on Friday, the party’s chief whip Hitraj Pandey said they would resist the ruling coalition’s attempts to oust her with a two-thirds majority, although he acknowledged Rana’s mistake. UML General Secretary Pokharel says the decision to remove Rana is a matter for the parliament to decide. He also emphasised that both the RSP and Rana should clarify their stance on the issue. “If the allegations are true, she should resign. She is no longer fit for the role,” he said.A meeting of senior Congress leaders on Wednesday concluded that Rana had misused her post by writing directly to the US embassy. “That is why we are calling for her resignation. If she does not resign, we will initiate the process to remove her,” said party’s chief whip Shyam Ghimire. “She made a blunder by writing to the Embassy in such a manner.” “The process could take some time—possibly another two or three days,” said Ghimire. On February 26 last year, Rana wrote a letter to the US Embassy requesting visa interviews for herself and five others. She has been facing pressure to step down after the letter was leaked two months ago. In the letter, Rana requested the embassy to expedite interview dates for six people, including herself. The others named in the letter were Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar, and Dhan Prasad Gurung. Rana had written that she wanted the interview dates to be preponed as they were attending the 67th Commission on the Status of Women session, scheduled in New York from March 6 to 17, 2023. The RSP leaders have also admitted that Rana misused her position by directly writing to the US embassy, but argue that the ruling alliance has blown the issue out of proportion after 19 months. The RSP and some fringe parties claim that the ruling parties want a Congress member as Deputy Speaker so that the alliance has an upper hand or absolute majority in the powerful Constitutional Council, which elects the chiefs and members of constitutional bodies including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The Congress, despite being the largest party in the House of Representatives, does not have representation in the Council. Both the Congress and the UML have already gathered the necessary signatures to remove Rana if she refuses to step down. Although the UML appears unified on the issue, there are some differences in the Congress. The party’s Shekhar Koirala faction has expressed dissatisfaction with the plan to remove Rana.

On February 26 last year, Rana wrote a letter to the US Embassy requesting visa interviews for herself and five others. She has been facing pressure to step down after the letter was leaked two months ago. In the letter, Rana requested the embassy to expedite interview dates for six people, including herself. The others named in the letter were Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar, and Dhan Prasad Gurung. Rana had written that she wanted the interview dates to be preponed as they were attending the 67th Commission on the Status of Women session, scheduled in New York from March 6 to 17, 2023. The RSP leaders have also admitted that Rana misused her position by directly writing to the US embassy, but argue that the ruling alliance has blown the issue out of proportion after 19 months. The RSP and some fringe parties claim that the ruling parties want a Congress member as Deputy Speaker so that the alliance has an upper hand or absolute majority in the powerful Constitutional Council, which elects the chiefs and members of constitutional bodies including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The Congress, despite being the largest party in the House of Representatives, does not have representation in the Council. Both the Congress and the UML have already gathered the necessary signatures to remove Rana if she refuses to step down. Although the UML appears unified on the issue, there are some differences in the Congress. The party’s Shekhar Koirala faction has expressed dissatisfaction with the plan to remove Rana.

Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” ","summary":"The rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers.

This year, he aims to double his income.Mushroom grower Subedi has a farm in Padampur, Kalila municipality, producing two varieties—oyster and button.Last year, Subedi cultivated button mushrooms for only three months. This year, he prepared an air conditioner (AC) for mushroom cultivation, which he can use to produce mushrooms around the year.The AC chamber involves cooling, humidity, heating, CO2 control, fresh and return air mixing, exhaust and microcirculation. This equipment efficiently controls the climate for mushrooms in various air conditioning systems.Subedi expects that, as button mushrooms are comparatively more expensive, production round the year would double his income.Subedi, originally from Nawalparasi, went to Belgium in 2002. He trained for two years on mushroom farming during his five-year stay in the European country.He also migrated to other countries for a job and returned to Nepal four years ago.Initially, he worked in another person's mushroom farm.“After returning from the foreign country, I worked on mushroom farms in Bhairahawa and Jugedi,” said Subedi.In December 2022, he leased a land plot in Padampur and started growing mushrooms.Starting with an initial investment of Rs500,000, he gradually expanded the investment. Observing good income from mushrooms throughout the year, Subedi installed an AC chamber.Production grew significantly after the installation of the AC chamber.“Though it is called an AC chamber, it is an air handling unit. This technology creates appropriate humidity and temperature for mushroom production,” Subedi said. An AC chamber costs around Rs1.1 million.Subedi has 12 such chambers. The provincial government provided him with a subsidy for one unit, and he managed to purchase 11 AC chambers on his own.“I have invested Rs40 million in total. Of that, Rs20.5 million is from loans,” Subedi said.Though the price of oyster mushrooms fluctuates, the price of button mushrooms is stable around the year, Subedi said. “Sometimes, from Rs200 a kg, the price of mushrooms drops suddenly, and I have to sell it for as low as Rs100 per kg.”He said that button mushrooms fetched up to Rs350 a kg. “With that income and demand for button mushrooms in mind, I prepared for commercial farming and installed the AC chambers.”AC chamber technology for mushroom farming is new in Nepal. Mushrooms are being produced with its use in Bhairahawa, Sarlahi, Gaidakot, Jugedi, and Kathmandu.“I learned the skill in a foreign country and started producing something in my own country. I have a plan to take mushroom cultivation forward in a more manageable way with new technology,” Subedi said.Kalika Municipality produces mushrooms worth more than Rs40 million annually, said Mayor Binod Regmi. “There are 80 households involved in mushroom farming.”The farmers have started using new technology for the crop, which has made some of them entrepreneurs and generated jobs.Most of the mushroom is grown in ward 2 of Kalika Municipality.“Since last year, I’ve started producing mushroom seed as well. The sales of seeds are also going well,” said Subedi. He has hired 26 workers. However, it is difficult to retain them.Subedi has also imported the equipment from New Delhi, India, to sprinkle water in the chamber.Seventy percent of the mushroom he produces is consumed in Chitwan while the rest is supplied to Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Surkhet.Farmers who have installed AC chambers require electricity 24 hours.

One is complying with the transaction limit, and another is geo tracking.”The central bank has set some conditions before giving approval to launch the service.As per the rules, Nepali citizens are not allowed to transact more than IRs100,000 in India per month. The banks need to comply with such restrictions for QR code payments.“The banks are currently working on setting a limit on transactions,” Kunwar said.Kunwar said the banks are also working on location tracking to ensure that the person is making transactions from India.“The banks are all set for the launch of the QR code payment for Nepali citizens in India. Our trial transaction has been successful,” said Gyanendra Prasad Dhungana, immediate past president of the Nepal Bankers’ Association.Dhungana, the CEO of Nabil Bank, said they conducted the trial transaction in Mumbai, India, last week.“So, we are ready to go live anytime if PSOs and the central bank signal the go-ahead.”According to the central bank's monthly payment systems indicator report, QR code payments increased by 104.81 percent to Rs61.73 billion from mid-June to mid-July compared to last year.The number of transactions also increased to 20.82 million from 9.76 million during the review period.On March 1, Indians in Nepal were allowed to make payments through their mobile phones. The development was hailed as a milestone in cross-border digital payment between Nepal and India, facilitating the students and people going to India for medical purposes.The QR code system has become a boon for tourists, especially those from India.It has reduced the hassle of carrying cash as the Nepal government has banned all Indian notes above the denomination of 100.With the Fonepay service available in Muktinath and trekking areas connected to Pokhara, Indian tourists are increasingly scanning and paying.The central bank issued a circular on June 27 allowing a merchant-to-person payment (M2P) system. This system allows PSOs to make agreements with PSOs in any country and start the service.However, before signing a memorandum of understanding, the PSOs need the central bank’s approval.Over the past decade, Nepal has witnessed a surge in digital adoption. According to the central bank report, the 4G/LTE services now cover 739 of 753 local units across 77 districts in Nepal. The smartphone penetration rate is 72.94 percent, and 38 percent of households have access to Internet services. The cost of connectivity has also dropped significantly from $2.25 per gigabyte in 2019 to $0.46 per gigabyte in 2023.Thus, as digital technologies become accessible and affordable, the digital divide, especially the rural and gender divide, is gradually narrowing. The central bank report said that opportunities still exist for digital innovators, as 50 percent of adults from rural areas and 40 percent from urban areas still lack an account at a financial institution.Nepal has experienced many innovations, especially in the digital payments industry, after the Covid-19 pandemic. New payment instruments have evolved in the payment system, changing how people transact and bank. Such instruments are Quick Response (QR) codes, connectIPS (Instant Payment System), Cardless Withdrawal, Smart Point-of-Sale (POS), Contactless Cards based on Near-Field Communication (NFC) technology, Virtual Cards, Digital Lending. Nepal has further operationalised the Retail Payment Switch (RPS) to settle retail payment transactions within the nation, and the development of the National Payment Switch (NPS) is in progress. The central bank said that physical banking has transformed into phygital banking, and the nation has gradually been marching towards a fully digital banking landscape. As of mid-July 2023, 37 payment institutions were licensed. Of these, 27 are PSPs, and 10 are Payment System Operators (PSOs). In addition, all 20 commercial banks, 16 development banks, 15 finance companies, and seven microfinance financial institutions have obtained the licence to operate as PSPs from the Nepal Rastra Bank. ","summary":"Nepalis’ wait to scan and pay in India isn’t over yet.The central bank in mid-July allowed Nepali payment system operators to deal with digital retail payments in any country on purchasing goods and services through person-to-merchant (P2M), but none of the Nepali operators has shown an interest, except India.This provision allows the Nepali payment system operator to agree with any PSO in any country to launch the quick response (QR) code payment system for the citizens of both countries to make purchases.Nepal’s Fonepay, a PSO, has partnered with India’s NPCI International Payments to launch the cross-border payment service using QR codes in a few months.“We have estimated a time of around a month and a half to complete all the technical processes before launching QR code payment service in India,” said Paras Kunwar, chief operating officer (COO) of Fonepay. “We have finished the trial, but before going live, the Indian and Nepali banks must be ready.”“We [Fonepay] and the banks are working on two technical parts of QR code payment. One is complying with the transaction limit, and another is geo tracking.”The central bank has set some conditions before giving approval to launch the service.As per the rules, Nepali citizens are not allowed to transact more than IRs100,000 in India per month. The banks need to comply with such restrictions for QR code payments.“The banks are currently working on setting a limit on transactions,” Kunwar said.Kunwar said the banks are also working on location tracking to ensure that the person is making transactions from India.“The banks are all set for the launch of the QR code payment for Nepali citizens in India. Our trial transaction has been successful,” said Gyanendra Prasad Dhungana, immediate past president of the Nepal Bankers’ Association.Dhungana, the CEO of Nabil Bank, said they conducted the trial transaction in Mumbai, India, last week.“So, we are ready to go live anytime if PSOs and the central bank signal the go-ahead.”According to the central bank's monthly payment systems indicator report, QR code payments increased by 104.81 percent to Rs61.73 billion from mid-June to mid-July compared to last year.The number of transactions also increased to 20.82 million from 9.76 million during the review period.On March 1, Indians in Nepal were allowed to make payments through their mobile phones. The development was hailed as a milestone in cross-border digital payment between Nepal and India, facilitating the students and people going to India for medical purposes.The QR code system has become a boon for tourists, especially those from India.It has reduced the hassle of carrying cash as the Nepal government has banned all Indian notes above the denomination of 100.With the Fonepay service available in Muktinath and trekking areas connected to Pokhara, Indian tourists are increasingly scanning and paying.The central bank issued a circular on June 27 allowing a merchant-to-person payment (M2P) system. This system allows PSOs to make agreements with PSOs in any country and start the service.However, before signing a memorandum of understanding, the PSOs need the central bank’s approval.Over the past decade, Nepal has witnessed a surge in digital adoption. According to the central bank report, the 4G/LTE services now cover 739 of 753 local units across 77 districts in Nepal. The smartphone penetration rate is 72.94 percent, and 38 percent of households have access to Internet services. The cost of connectivity has also dropped significantly from $2.25 per gigabyte in 2019 to $0.46 per gigabyte in 2023.Thus, as digital technologies become accessible and affordable, the digital divide, especially the rural and gender divide, is gradually narrowing.

The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.So far this year, five people have died, and over 8,000 tested positive for the dengue virus, which has spread to 75 districts across the country. Officials admit that the real number of infections could be several times higher, as the government’s case reporting system is not very effective, and more than 80 percent of the cases are asymptomatic.Even symptomatic patients do not seek treatment unless they get severe. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms, which do not need any treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home. Public health experts warn that dengue cases could escalate in the coming days as the peak season of the virus spread has just started.Experts emphasise the need for a massive awareness campaign for destroying the breeding ground of the dengue-spreading vector— and that the public must be made aware of the treatment.“Health authorities are not even implementing basic measures like launching an effective awareness drive to destroy the breeding sites of these vectors,” said Marasini. “The adult population is getting infected at workplaces, and children are being exposed at schools.”Experts say that the ongoing spread of dengue could have been prevented had the authorities taken the problem seriously and initiated a search-and-destroy drive. They say the disease will continue to spread unless lessons from previous outbreaks are effectively implemented.“Just counting the number of infected people will achieve nothing. Neither can we stop the spread of the virus nor determine the true extent of the outbreak,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “Only those who suffer from severe dengue know how bad it is.”Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections and major outbreaks have been reported from many districts.Last year, at least 20 persons died and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. In that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months.

According to the World Health Organization, it is a mosquito-borne flavivirus with the same genus as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The case-fatality rate among those infected can be as high as 30 percent. Permanent neurologic, cognitive, and behavioural sequelae occur in 30 to 50 percent of those with encephalitis, according to the UN health body.Doctors say the disease has no cure, so they provide only symptomatic treatment. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent the JE infection. Nepal has included the vaccine in its routine immunisation list, which the government provides free of cost to all children.Even though the vaccine is included in the regular immunisation list, several people die and dozens get infected by the deadly virus every year.The Health Directorate of Sudurpaschim Province, reported that two patients—a nine-year-old boy from ward 5 and a 60-year-old man from ward 6 of Ghodaghodi Municipality of the district—died from the infection.“The National Public Health Laboratory, which carried out serological tests, confirmed the virus in both deceased and infected patients,” Dr Khagendra Bam, acting director of the directorate, told the Post over the phone from Doti. “Four others receiving treatment at hospitals are from adjoining Gauriganga Municipality, and their conditions are stable.”Officials say they are currently collecting data on under-five children to administer the vaccine.

Long waiting lists at the hospitals should have ended as of now if it was so easy to do.”Most health ministers visit state-run hospitals upon assuming office and direct officials concerned to end the long waiting lists, commit to increasing human resources, and provide a required budget to ease patients’ suffering.Doctors say people have not expected the repetition of the same commitments from the new minister, from whom they have expected some changes.“Why would one serve on public holidays without any incentive, and how could the government force only health workers to serve on public holidays, not other civil servants?” questioned Mahendra Prasad Shrestha, a retired chief specialist at the Health Ministry. “I didn’t find other countries providing outpatient care on public holidays.”Upreti, who also served as chairman of the Health Insurance Board, said the minister's commitment to increase the coverage of the government’s health insurance scheme to Rs500,000 shortly shows his ignorance about the ground reality. The government pays a premium of over 50 percent of those enrolled in the scheme and has to allocate additional billions of rupees to reimburse the hospitals. Due to the government’s inability to reimburse hospitals on time, many hospitals threaten to stop providing the scheme every year.Public health experts say the government has not increased human resources in state-run hospitals in the last 30 years. Despite that, the number of patients seeking health care has increased manifold, and the capacity and budget of health facilities have not increased accordingly. They said that all staffers are needed to run health facilities on public holidays, and the government has not allocated an additional budget to run health facilities on public holidays.“I have suggested the new health minister to start from small things,” said Shrestha. “He might have thought that ending long waiting lists in state-run hospitals is trivial, but it is not so trivial. I have also asked him to hold staffers of the Health Ministry until office hours first.”Meanwhile, the Nepal Medical Association, the umbrella organisation of medical doctors, has protested against the decision to run outpatient departments on public holidays.Issuing a statement on Tuesday, the association sought the government’s attention to the lack of human resources in the state-run health facilities.“No new post has been created in the last 33 years,” said Dr Anil Bikram Karki, chairman of the association. “Doctors have already been working 72 hours a week despite not being incentivised to work during the Covid-19 pandemic. We have strong reservations against the decision to run outpatient care on public holidays without offering incentives to health workers and increasing the human resources.”Doctors say the long waiting lines in state-run health facilities will end if the government creates additional posts for health workers, including doctors, and makes the referral mechanism systematic.They said patients should not be forced to visit Kathmandu to examine minor health problems. Instead, health workers and services should be made available in the local health facilities, human resources should be increased, and more budget should be allocated.“If we have problems with long waiting lines in hospitals, citizens have to endure long queues while accessing public service,” said Karki. “Doctors never deny emergency services, but one should not mix emergency care with elective care [planned medical care]. We should acknowledge that doctors are human beings.

We have strong reservations against the decision to run outpatient care on public holidays without offering incentives to health workers and increasing the human resources.”Doctors say the long waiting lines in state-run health facilities will end if the government creates additional posts for health workers, including doctors, and makes the referral mechanism systematic.They said patients should not be forced to visit Kathmandu to examine minor health problems. Instead, health workers and services should be made available in the local health facilities, human resources should be increased, and more budget should be allocated.“If we have problems with long waiting lines in hospitals, citizens have to endure long queues while accessing public service,” said Karki. “Doctors never deny emergency services, but one should not mix emergency care with elective care [planned medical care]. We should acknowledge that doctors are human beings. They, too, have families and will be stressed and burnt out if they are forced to work continuously.” "},{"hash":"bd2df4227ddba14e60e8ae88cf36b0b3318fdf4cfd629328df08d0dc34aef848","title":"over-3-500-infected-with-scrub-typhus-since-mid-july","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/health/2024/08/27/over-3-500-infected-with-scrub-typhus-since-mid-july","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/thumb-1724717569.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1724716800000,"source":"kp","category":"health","content":"Over 3,500 people across the country have been infected with scrub typhus since mid-July, the start of this fiscal year.Officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division say they expect more cases in the coming days as the disease typically peaks in September.“Like in previous years, hundreds of people have also been infected with scrub typhus this year,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of vector Control Section at the division. “More people can get infected in the coming days, as the peak season is still ahead.”Scrub typhus, or bush typhus, is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Orientia tsutsugamushi, a mite-borne bacterium. It spreads in humans when bitten by infected chiggers (larval mites) found in mice.Until a few years ago, it was believed that people residing in rural areas or those working in grasslands or fields were at high risk. However, urban populations are also now being affected by the disease.“Over 100 people from Hetauda Sub-metropolitan city have been infected from Scrub typhus this year,” said Krishna Bahadur Major, chief of the Health Office, Makawanpur. “Although more cases are reported in villages, urban areas are not immune, with several positive cases emerging there as well.”Doctors point out high fever, headache, abdominal pain, backache, joint and muscle pain, red rash, nausea and vomiting as some of the symptoms of scrub typhus infection. Patients with severe illness may develop bleeding which could lead to organ failure. The infection can lead to respiratory distress, inflation of brain, lungs, kidney failure and then multi-organ failure. If not treated immediately, it could be fatal.Nepal saw a surge in scrub typhus cases after the calamitous 2015 earthquakes that killed nearly 9,000 persons across the country.Three months after the quakes, the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, alerted the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division about six children with unusual fevers and severe respiratory problems.Serum samples were collected for subsequent tests in Kathmandu and Bangkok, which confirmed a scrub typhus outbreak. By then, four children had already died in the course of the treatment. By the end of the year, 101 cases were confirmed in 16 districts, and four more people succumbed to the disease.The magnitude of the outbreak escalated in 2016 when 831 cases of scrub typhus were reported in 47 districts, and 14 people died by the end of that year.According to the Ministry of Health and Population data, more than 1,026 people were infected with the disease in 2020. Their number increased to 1,999 in 2021, and it rose to more than 2,900 in 2022.In 2023, over 5,000 people were infected with the deadly disease. Doctors say the risk of severity and fatality can be minimised if the patients are diagnosed and treated early, they say.Ordinary antibiotics, such as doxycycline and azithromycin, which are on the essential drugs list supplied by the government to health facilities across the country for free distribution, can cure the disease.However, what is concerning is that many health workers, including doctors, lack sufficient knowledge about diagnosing scrub typhus. Many health facilities also lack reagents to carry out tests for the disease.Doctors can diagnose the disease based on the symptoms, but the risk of misdiagnosis is high, as scrub typhus symptoms are similar to those of other illnesses. They warn that waiting for lab results before starting treatment could be dangerous. It can take about a week to get lab results, and by that time, if the patient is not treated can fall into a coma and suffer multi-organ failure.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. ","summary":"In a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees.

Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. ","summary":"We spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution.

He further pointed out that the Supreme Court had questioned the central government’s move, proving that a government can indeed operate from behind bars.”The decision comes days after he was granted bail by the Supreme Court in connection with a liquor policy linked corruption case.While Kejriwal was granted bail, he was barred from entering the office of chief minister and signing any file without the consent of the Delhi Governor.-Asia News Network "},{"hash":"61839d3f86364a288938d897eb52453aa42d867700b13459332557927034d3a9","title":"venezuela-arrests-spain-us-and-czech-nationals-for-destabilization","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/world/2024/09/15/venezuela-arrests-spain-us-and-czech-nationals-for-destabilization","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/world/D35ZVH6AFNOBFIKDYRYILCWOP4-1726372023.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1726358400000,"source":"kp","category":"world","content":"Two Spaniards, three US citizens and a Czech have been arrested in Venezuela on suspicion of links to alleged plans to destabilize the South American country, a top Venezuela official said on Saturday.A spokesperson for the US State Department said “a US military member” had been detained in Venezuela and that it was aware of unconfirmed reports of two additional US citizens being detained there, but rejected a Venezuelan claim of US involvement in any plot to overthrow the government.The Venezuelan announcement is likely to deepen the country’s already substantial tensions with Spain and the United States after Venezuela’s disputed presidential election in July.Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello in a press conference said two Spaniards were allegedly linked to Spain’s secret service and planning the assassination of a mayor.Spanish media reported that Spain’s government denied this claim.Cabello also accused three US citizens and a Czech of involvement in terrorist acts, including alleged plans to assassinate Maduro and other officials.“These groups seek to seize the country’s wealth, and we as a government will respond firmly to any destabilization attempt,” Cabello said.

She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. ","summary":"What animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall.

So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

However, after the end of World War II and the beginning of the re-structuring of world politics—the end of the British colonial era in South Asia, the rise of the US as a superpower and the end of the Rana regime in Nepal in 1951—we saw the beginning of a new era of engagements for Nepal and Nepalis with new states, in particular the US, and with other foreign institutions and nationals. Various unpublished records of these new types of engagements have ended up across different archives worldwide. Here, I would like to point to three different types of new archival collections that we need to pay attention to if we want to write good histories of the Nepali-videshi encounters of the 1950s. First, as Nepal’s engagements with the US increased in the post-WWII era, collections of official documents of these engagements have ended up in the state archives of Nepal and the US. This means that US-based publicly-supported archives now hold many documents that have a direct bearing on the histories of Nepal during the long 1950s (which started before 1950 and ended after 1960). For instance, there are many US State Department documents at the US National Archives in College Park, Maryland (NARA II). Historian Daniel W Edwards consulted these documents some time ago. He has done researchers a favour by publishing America Meets Nepal 1944-1952: Problems, Personalities & Political Change (2022), which contains various extracts from the “most interesting parts” of the relevant documents of the early Nepal-US encounters. Similarly, in producing several articles on US involvement in Nepal during the Cold War, environmental historian Thomas Robertson has relied not only on the documents in NARA II but also those held at the USAID Library in Washington, D. and the Harry S Truman Presidential Library in Independence, Missouri. Some Nepal-related documents are now available in the online USAID archives.Second, the involvement of specific foreign institutions in Nepal during the long 1950s gave birth to specific holdings in institutional archives. The University of Oregon and several of its faculty members, including Hugh B Wood, were involved in planning and implementing educational programmes in Nepal during the 1950s. In fact, Wood was the primary advisor to the first National Education Planning Commission, which produced its report in 1955. Hence, it is no surprise that an American academic who researches the history of education in Nepal, Jeremy Rappleye, has consulted the University of Oregon archives in Oregon, US, to write an interesting article on the work of Wood in Nepal. That article was published in the June 2019 issue of the journal Studies in Nepali History and Society (SINHAS). Rappleye reports that there are many more Nepal-related materials at the University of Oregon archives, including films, for other researchers. Such archives also exist for other foreign institutions that became involved in Nepal in the 1950s. For example, New Zealand-based historian Susan Heydon relied on the archives of what came to be known as the International Nepal Fellowship and the United Mission to Nepal (UMN) to write an article on foreign-Nepali medical encounters during the 1950s. These archives are now held at the Divinity School Library of Yale University in Connecticut, US. I suspect similar archives exist for other US-based institutions (e.g., Ford Foundation) and similar entities in the UK, India and elsewhere that were involved in bikas work in Nepal then.Third, the involvement and action of specific individuals, both Nepalis and videshis, in Nepal during the 1950s can be researched through a reading of their private papers, including photographic images they might have taken or gathered. While I suspect that a majority of such papers have either been destroyed or are still held in private family collections, some have ended up in archives run by universities, and think tanks. For instance, the bulk of Robertson’s sources in an article he published in the same issue of SINHAS, came from the private papers of Chester Bowles, US Ambassador to India and Nepal during the early 1950s and a graduate of Yale. These papers are now held at the Yale University Library. Similarly, Rappleye’s article relies heavily on the personal papers of Hugh B Wood, now held at the Hoover Institutional Library & Archives located at Stanford University in California, US. The Wood papers, available in 42 boxes, have not yet been catalogued. These papers have also been consulted by Lokranjan Parajuli and are referred to in his forthcoming chapter on the politics of the founding of Tribhuvan University. Such unpublished personal papers and photographs are also available in archives in Nepal. For example, about 500 photographs taken by Harold Lyle Dusenberry (1907-91) are available in the Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya (MPP) in Patan Dhoka. Dusenberry, an American, did two stints in Nepal (1952-54, 1956-58). He advised agricultural programmes and trained rural development workers (see his 1958 report available online, Six Years of Village Development in Nepal). Among the 500 photographs organised in five albums held in MPP, there are many that document the Nepali-videshi encounter of that era in interesting ways. Once, Dusenberry and his team members visited Pokhara. While it is not clear exactly when this visit took place, these photographs document the team’s temporary camp in Bindabasini chaur in Pokhara and various encounters in that city. In the photo above, you can see several US team members taking a bath in the open and many dozen Nepalis observing the act. There are also several photos of training sessions and technical demonstrations held in Kathmandu. I have given examples of three types of unpublished archival records in state archives, institutional archives and personal paper holdings that came into existence due to the new Nepali-videshi encounters after WWII. Since some of these archives exist in Nepal, our university faculty members should encourage their students to explore them for their dissertation research. Those who hold other records of such encounters should be encouraged to deposit them at our public institutions so that younger researchers can access them.With respect to the archives located in the US and elsewhere, Nepal-based researchers should seek travel fellowships to visit those archives. One such fellowship allowed Parajuli to visit Stanford in 2017 to study the Wood Papers. In the long run, we can also hope that these archives will put their holdings online to facilitate the work of researchers who are unable to travel for on-site consultations of those records. There are yet other ways to facilitate the reading of such collections by researchers. What is stopping the history department at Yale University from offering a dissertation fellowship to a deserving PhD student—of any nationality—who wants to work on the above-mentioned archival collections related to Nepal that are now physically located there? Also, what is stopping the various Nepali NRN groups from supporting the doctoral research of a Nepali (from Nepal or the Nepali diaspora) on collections mentioned above at NARA II, Yale or Stanford?

While it is not clear exactly when this visit took place, these photographs document the team’s temporary camp in Bindabasini chaur in Pokhara and various encounters in that city. In the photo above, you can see several US team members taking a bath in the open and many dozen Nepalis observing the act. There are also several photos of training sessions and technical demonstrations held in Kathmandu. I have given examples of three types of unpublished archival records in state archives, institutional archives and personal paper holdings that came into existence due to the new Nepali-videshi encounters after WWII. Since some of these archives exist in Nepal, our university faculty members should encourage their students to explore them for their dissertation research. Those who hold other records of such encounters should be encouraged to deposit them at our public institutions so that younger researchers can access them.With respect to the archives located in the US and elsewhere, Nepal-based researchers should seek travel fellowships to visit those archives. One such fellowship allowed Parajuli to visit Stanford in 2017 to study the Wood Papers. In the long run, we can also hope that these archives will put their holdings online to facilitate the work of researchers who are unable to travel for on-site consultations of those records. There are yet other ways to facilitate the reading of such collections by researchers. What is stopping the history department at Yale University from offering a dissertation fellowship to a deserving PhD student—of any nationality—who wants to work on the above-mentioned archival collections related to Nepal that are now physically located there? Also, what is stopping the various Nepali NRN groups from supporting the doctoral research of a Nepali (from Nepal or the Nepali diaspora) on collections mentioned above at NARA II, Yale or Stanford?

After days- or weeks-long agitation, successive governments have signed agreements with the representatives of the victims. For instance, last year, the then minister for Land Management, Cooperatives, and Poverty Alleviation, Ranjita Shrestha, promised to resolve their problems and signed a seven-point agreement in the first week of August. The government failed to implement it. Then Balaram Adhikari replaced Shrestha at the ministry. The victims had to take to the streets again as the government failed to honour its commitment. Then, an Adhikari-led committee signed an eight-point agreement in March this year. This too was shelved.The authorities failed to make any progress even on the announcement made in the annual budget unveiled in May. The then finance minister Barsha Man Pun, while presenting the budget on May 28, had announced that the money of small depositors of up to Rs 500,000 would be returned. There was no progress on this front as well. Cheated by authorities multiple times, the cooperative victims yet again resumed their protest. This time, after a 108-day long protest, the authorities yet again signed an eight-point agreement with the victims on Monday. And yet again, things are not looking good for the victims. On Tuesday, a day after the ministry officials reached a new deal in Kathmandu and the victims became ready to halt their protests, the area outside the venue in Pokhara where a provincial meeting of the Rastriya Swatantra Party was to take place, turned tense. This happened after a group of cooperative victims showed black flags to party chief Rabi Lamichhane, who is accused of embezzling millions of rupees from Pokhara-based Surya Darshan and other cooperatives. Former home minister Lamichhane vented his ire against the victims. He even went on to accuse the victims of being ‘mobilised’ at the behest of certain external elements. This was something unbecoming of the leader of the fourth largest force in the House—and of an ex-deputy prime minister at that. Lamichhane is one of the most high-profile individuals accused in the cooperative scam. A special parliamentary inquiry committee is investigating his involvement. The panel last month quizzed him continuously for around 10 hours. Though Lamichhane and his party have been claiming his innocence, several probes including those carried out by the House committee, police, local governments and other agencies point to his prominent role in the embezzlement of cooperative funds.Multiple studies and investigations have shown that the gravity of the cooperative crisis is unimaginable. The chair of the parliamentary special inquiry committee Surya Thapa says if the issue is not handled properly and promptly, the country’s entire financial sector could face a crisis. As of now, the House panel has found problems in around 500 cooperatives.We thus urge ‘high profile individuals’ linked to the scam not to incite the victims, who have already been cheated by cooperatives and subsequently by government authorities—multiple times. They seem to be running out of patience. The agitation by hundreds of thousands of angry victims of cooperatives may take a nasty turn at any time. At his volatile time, using disrespectful language against them would be like rubbing salt into their wounds. In the same spirit, we urge the parliamentary committee to quickly conclude the study and hand over the final report to the government. Prolonging this sordid saga is in no one’s interest, especially the victims who have clamoured for justice for so long.

However, as in previous years, Nepali men didn’t want to leave them alone as they slid into their DMs and comment sections with hate speech and trolls criticising the women and body-shaming them. Such forms of online harassment aren’t seen only during festivals but are an everyday experience for many Nepali women. The internet has become an appendage of the physical reality where violence against women manifests in varied forms, including physical threats, sex trolling, zoom bombing, cyber flashing, revenge porn, etc. Moreover, it has become easier for the perpetrators to target many women at the same time using different online personas. This is evident in the data of the Cyber Bureau of Nepal, where 882 cyber crime cases against women were recorded in just the first two months of the fiscal year 2024-25. The past trends paint a worrying picture, as the bureau reported a total of 5,574 online harassment cases between 2016 and 2020. There were 9,013 reported cybercrime cases, with 4,590 filed by women in the fiscal year 2022-23. The following year saw an approximate of 90.52 percent increase in cybercrime cases filed by women, for a total of 8,745 cases. With the advancement of digital technologies and the rise of AI content, women are being subjected to more forms of online abuse. A 2019 study revealed that 96 percent deepfake online videos were pornographic, highlighting how they are being used to demean women. In recent years, female journalists, celebrities and politicians have been repeatedly targeted online. The private lives of female politicians are endlessly scrutinised, and they face judgements online based on their intelligence and appearance. A report in 2021 showed that the Finnish female government ministers, including former Prime Minister Sanna Marin, were routinely criticised as the “lipstick government” or “Tampax team” on X. In our own country, this is apparent in the recent trolling of former Minister of Education, Science and Technology Sumana Shrestha and Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Sunita Dangol In Nepal, where per capita internet use is higher than in some developed countries but digital literacy is low, lack of cyber regulation creates a breeding ground for cyber violence. Section 47 of the Electronic Transaction Act, 2007 states that publishing material that harms public morality or decent behaviour could result in a fine of Rs 100,000 and up to five years of imprisonment. It doesn’t define what falls under these terms. Moreover, the Act doesn’t mention revenge porn or other forms of cyber abuse. We must have a strict legal framework as the platforms’ Community Standards and reporting systems on content removal can only do so much, especially in non-English languages where the bots can’t recognise local languages, slang and dialects. The issue has clearly not gotten the priority it should: a recent Post report revealed that the Cyber Bureau in Nepal is highly understaffed and underfunded, with only 26 of a desired staff level of 106 handling the IT department that solves cases. Cyber violence towards women underscores the bigger problem of misogyny ingrained in our societies. When misogynists see women taking up space and challenging traditional gender roles online, they police and shun them on the same platform. Without having a proper regulatory mechanism in place, technological advancement will only further help these moral police.

The recent ruling only appears to bolster his desire to remove riverside settlers and slum areas under the guise of cleaning up Kathmandu. Although Shah uncharacteristically softened his stance through his Facebook post on Sunday, insisting that no homes would be demolished in the process, it happened only after widespread criticism. But then the whole post is rather long-winded, intended more at criticising the federal government and his many critics there rather than reassuring the public of his commitment to protecting their land and property. The consequences of this verdict cannot be overlooked. Rivers and springs run through much of the valley’s prime lands, where many have poured their hard-earned money.

The Supreme Court’s decision to mandate the additional buffer zone also raises questions about the judiciary’s decision-making. Why does the apex court have to rule by going well beyond what the petitioner has asked, be it in relation to the tenure of police officers or the size of the buffer lands besides major rivers? In this particular case, Shah has wielded the court decision like a wrecking ball.

This does not mean he should start listening to everyone and veer off his priorities. But as the city’s mayor, he should be mindful that the steps he is taking are in the interest of the people who call Kathmandu home.

But do the global accolades Nepal has earned in terms of its progressiveness reflect the actual experiences of queer people here? The Post’s Aarati Ray sat down with Manisha Dhakal, executive director of the Blue Diamond Society and a leading advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights in South Asia for over 23 years.Nepal is often hailed for its progressive stance on queer rights, both in South Asia and globally. With over two decades of queer rights advocacy, how accurate do you find this portrayal?Many activists and commentators do describe Nepal as being progressive on queer rights. While this is partly true, especially when we consider the legal frameworks, the reality at the grassroots is quite different. On the one hand, Nepal’s constitution recognises LGBTQIA+ identities. Articles 12 and 18 mandate that “gender identity” be acknowledged on citizenship certificates, while Article 42 promises affirmative action and participation in government for sexual and gender minorities. Court decisions in Nepal, too, have been favourable for LGBTQIA+ rights, and unlike many former British colonies with Section 377-type laws that criminalise queer communities, Nepal has no such legal barriers. So, indeed, there are opportunities for activism, and progress has been made, particularly in terms of legal recognition. But, again, the rights enshrined in the constitution and affirmed by the courts have not been realised at the grassroots level. We are stuck with a limited focus, primarily on citizenship. The state claims that we’ve been given the right to identity and legal recognition, but even this is not fully realised. For example, the process of obtaining citizenship based on self-identification remains difficult, with government officials still unclear on how to implement these provisions. The broader narrative of Nepal being progressive is built on a superficial understanding of the situation.In August, Nepal’s Supreme Court ruled that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, should be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without medical verification. How does this decision impact the future of LGBTQIA+ rights in Nepal?Rukshana’s case is a prominent victory, highlighting the judiciary’s support for LGBTQIA+ rights, especially compared to those of the executive and legislative branches. This ruling lays a strong foundation for similar future cases and will undoubtedly help in future activism. However, it’s important to note that the decision applies only to Kapali, meaning others will still need to go through the courts to have their gender identity legally recognised. How long must transgender individuals continue to endure lengthy court processes just to obtain citizenship?Even outside the courts, the bureaucratic hurdles—from medical reassignment surgeries to invasive checkups and long delays from the CDO (District Administration Office) to the Ministry of Home Affairs—can take years, with no guarantee of getting preferred names on legal documents. In many cases, even after completing the process, the names are inaccurately changed, such as altering Ram to Rama instead of the preferred name, like Manisha.We [Blue Diamond Society] get 15-20 complaints each year, primarily from transgender women, regarding difficulties in obtaining citizenship.The Supreme Court’s recent decision on same-sex marriage in Nepal has attracted global attention and gotten a positive response. Are there any limits to the court’s decision?After a long and arduous process, we secured temporary registration for same-sex marriages. On June 28, 2023, the Supreme Court, in the Pinky Gurung vs. Government of Nepal case, issued an interim order instructing the government to temporarily register same-sex marriages, including for those with “other” gender markers. That said, the Civil Code adopted in 2017 still defines marriage as a union between a ‘man’ and a ‘woman’.We, as a community, are pleased with the government’s temporary registration process. Yet it falls short of offering full marriage rights, including those related to property, adoption, and tax exemptions. While the court’s decision sets a supportive precedent, lack of clarity about the rights associated with the temporary certificate leaves many in limbo. So far, only around five couples have registered, and many in the community are hesitant to do so.The question remains: Can this temporary registration truly grant us the same recognition as heterosexual marriages? While the decision has garnered global praise, the LGBTQIA+ community on the ground continues to feel cheated of true equality. Our ultimate goal is to amend the Civil Code so that marriage is defined as a union between two individuals, rather than being restricted to one between male and female.Why do many court decisions on queer rights in Nepal, like of same-sex marriages, remain in limbo? Is this due to the government and courts trying to appease both conservative and progressive groups, or is it just a performative gesture of inclusivity?There are multiple factors at play. I think some responsibility also falls on activists. For example, when fighting for legal recognition since 2008, we should have advocated not only for the “third gender” or “other” but also for individuals who have transitioned from male to female or female to male. What’s more, policymakers and bureaucrats still lack awareness about human rights principles related to minority groups like the LGBTQIA+ community. Even though Nepal has ratified international conventions on human rights, these commitments have not been prioritised by lawmakers, which leads to this state of limbo and half-hearted inclusivity.As for the internal thought processes of bureaucrats and lawmakers, it’s hard to say. Many of them might still believe that the LGBTQIA+ community shouldn’t be granted full rights, so they engage in performative actions—appearing supportive on the surface to attract global attention but hesitating to fully advance our rights. This could explain why progress seems to stall midway.Queer rights have received some legal recognition. But how are they reflected in terms of social and cultural acceptance in Nepal?Legal changes and social acceptance need to go hand in hand. If we only focus on legal reforms without addressing societal attitudes, there will be no real change. We’ve seen this play out—there is legal recognition of gender identity, and temporary registration for same-sex marriage is available. Yet people struggle to fully realise these rights because of deep-rooted discrimination within families and society.In Nepal, a socially and culturally driven society, where family, relatives, and festivals play a major role, social acceptance is often more important than legal acceptance. When it comes to cultural acceptance, biases still persist. For example, it feels like we’re allowed to express ourselves openly only during the Pride Month in June. When we try to participate in other celebrations like Teej or Gaijatra, society often reacts negatively, asking why we need to “spoil” their festivals. This shows that social change is still lagging, despite the progress in legal rights.You mentioned that the queer community is often given the surface level of legal recognition. How is the state of the exercise of fundamental rights for LGBTQIA+ people in Nepal?Labelled as ‘gender and sexual minorities’, our broader struggles are ignored. When we raise concerns about poverty, food insecurity, or unemployment, the response we often get from government institutions and stakeholders is, “This isn’t our issue; it’s a gender problem.”We are just as much a part of society as anyone else. Issues like climate change, housing, and poverty affect us too. We want to be included in solutions, whether it’s participating in climate programs or being involved in community initiatives. Unfortunately, lawmakers and stakeholders often overlook that we are just as human as heterosexuals, with needs that go beyond legal recognition on paper.What are some aspects of the queer community that have not received enough attention in media narratives, and what tends to be unnecessarily highlighted?As I’ve mentioned before, the narrative surrounding our community often focuses heavily on issues like citizenship, while overlooking other important aspects of our lives. What’s missing is the correct representation of our contributions in various fields. Many LGBTQIA+ individuals are doctors, and experts in different professions, yet their accomplishments are only rarely acknowledged or represented. Instead, the focus often falls on the unfortunate image of some members of the community begging on the streets, which goes viral on social media.Another issue is the way we are predominantly associated with sex and sexuality. While these are important aspects of human identity, we are much more than that. We have other needs and rights that deserve attention. Unfortunately, the media tends to fixate on sexual aspects of the LGBTQIA+ community, reinforcing stereotypes. It’s time for the media to move beyond this narrow portrayal and include us in broader discussions that reflect the full scope of our lives.How has the current narrative of progressiveness in Nepal impacted real change for the LGBTQIA+ community?It’s time to move beyond this narrative of progressiveness. True progress should lead to further development, not be a barrier to it. Unfortunately, the current narrative seems to be stagnating.For instance, when we raise issues with the government, the response often is, “We’ve already given you the right to citizenship. You’re getting citizenship now.” Even when I travel people sometimes ask, “You’ve got citizenship, right? Things are becoming progressive.” This narrative of progressiveness has become an excuse for the government to claim they’ve done enough and to avoid further action.This surface-level progressiveness is used to showcase Nepal as forward-thinking internationally, but it hasn’t translated into real change for people at the grassroots. It also impedes activists’ efforts by providing the government with a shield against criticism. Until this narrative of progressiveness evolves into genuine, accountable action that goes beyond court decisions and performative gestures, it will continue to be a barrier to actual progress. ","summary":"Nepal has often earned global recognition for its progressive policies and inclusive stance on LGBTQIA+ rights. But do the global accolades Nepal has earned in terms of its progressiveness reflect the actual experiences of queer people here? The Post’s Aarati Ray sat down with Manisha Dhakal, executive director of the Blue Diamond Society and a leading advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights in South Asia for over 23 years.Nepal is often hailed for its progressive stance on queer rights, both in South Asia and globally. With over two decades of queer rights advocacy, how accurate do you find this portrayal?Many activists and commentators do describe Nepal as being progressive on queer rights. While this is partly true, especially when we consider the legal frameworks, the reality at the grassroots is quite different. On the one hand, Nepal’s constitution recognises LGBTQIA+ identities. Articles 12 and 18 mandate that “gender identity” be acknowledged on citizenship certificates, while Article 42 promises affirmative action and participation in government for sexual and gender minorities. Court decisions in Nepal, too, have been favourable for LGBTQIA+ rights, and unlike many former British colonies with Section 377-type laws that criminalise queer communities, Nepal has no such legal barriers. So, indeed, there are opportunities for activism, and progress has been made, particularly in terms of legal recognition. But, again, the rights enshrined in the constitution and affirmed by the courts have not been realised at the grassroots level. We are stuck with a limited focus, primarily on citizenship. The state claims that we’ve been given the right to identity and legal recognition, but even this is not fully realised. For example, the process of obtaining citizenship based on self-identification remains difficult, with government officials still unclear on how to implement these provisions. The broader narrative of Nepal being progressive is built on a superficial understanding of the situation.In August, Nepal’s Supreme Court ruled that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, should be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without medical verification.

Political parties displayed exemplary unity in the course of endorsing the bill, which was promptly welcomed by the international community. If this undertaking succeeds, the remaining tasks of Nepal’s nearly two-decade-long peace process will be completed. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert and former lawmaker Radheshyam Adhikari of Nepali Congress, who has over the years been closely involved in Nepal’s transitional justice process.As a legal expert, how do you see the latest amendment in the transitional justice Act?Looking at it from a legal perspective, the Supreme Court’s order given in this context is the major basis. The amendment has complied with over 95 percent of the top court’s directives. There is one more context we can refer to. The government in 2018 had prepared a ‘zero draft’ on this issue. The international community had expressed their reservations on certain provisions. Most of the contents of that draft have been retained while addressing those reservations. There are some major improvements. The amendment has taken a more liberal approach to victims’ rights. For instance, the draft had only said that the victims would be consulted for reconciliation but the latest amendment made victims’ consent mandatory. If a victim doesn’t want to give consent, he or she can go to court. This is a major change. Likewise, the draft had said the verdict of the to-be-formed Special Court [with a mandate to hear and decide the transitional justice related cases] would be final. But the amendment has allowed the dissatisfied side to appeal in the Supreme Court. There is a plan for a separate fund to carry out transitional justice related tasks so as to ensure fiscal autonomy for the two transitional justice commissions. This process needs fiscal as well as administrative autonomy. You just mentioned that the new Act has complied with 95 percent of the top court’s directives. Could you elaborate on the remaining five percent?I meant to say that the amendment is closer to the court’s directives. I can’t say it is 100 percent because even they [the Supreme Court justices] at the time said ‘so and so’ should be done on a hypothetical ground as so many things were still evolving. Now, some issues might have become redundant. But most of the things have been addressed. See, first, we should have conceptual clarity. There is a fundamental difference between retributive justice and transitional justice systems. In retributive justice, cases are decided by regular courts based on existing laws while in the transitional justice system we have to look into political, social as well as cultural aspects. This is the internationally accepted approach.The amendment has included a provision of up to 75 percent reduced sentencing. The attorney general, who works for the government, is mandated to recommend this. Isn’t this akin to directing the court? Wouldn’t it instead be prudent to leave that to the court? If that were not done, there would be mistrust and the process may not have gotten sufficient support from the warring sides of the past. In such a scenario, the process may have again failed. A supportive role of the stakeholders will be crucial. Of late, I often urge the victims to cooperate with the process; otherwise it will remain a never-ending process. It’s already too late. So, now we should be pragmatic. We should carry out things on a priority basis. Finding and respecting truth are the first and second priorities. The option to go to court is there, if someone wants so. The fourth priority is reparation. The goal is to establish that no one will need to take up arms and resort to violence in Nepal again. Now, most of the stakeholders are positive about concluding this process. The international community has in fact asked us what type of support we need.It is said the role of Desmond Tutu, who led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, was crucial for the success of the country’s transitional justice process. Do you think the personality of the heads of the commissions will be vital in our case as well?Leadership definitely matters. In Colombia as well, a person of similar stature, who is respected by all sides in the country, led the process. So, the leadership and composition of the commissions will matter. The commissions should be allowed to work and make decisions on their own.There are nearly 64,000 complaints with the TRC and around 2,400 with the CIEDP. How should the commissions carry out their task? Will they deal with each and every case individually? What are international practices and what is a broader conceptual understanding in our case?It is too early to talk about the working modality but I believe most cases should be dealt with in a representative way. But cases of serious rights violations will enter the prosecution stage. Producing sufficient evidence to prove the crimes, however, will be challenging. For instance, some rape victims may not be able to name the perpetrators. They were raped but couldn’t even recognise the perpetrator. In such a case, the state should respect such victims and provide reparation to them. Some complainants may choose not to continue with the cases. Before determining whether certain cases are serious or not, each file has to be checked at least once. So, the commissions need a large number of investigating officers. Field offices need to be set up based on the number and nature of complaints. What kind of involvement of international agencies may be needed for this process?It will certainly need the involvement of international agencies. Nepal’s peace process is basically home-grown but we will also seek support and expertise from international agencies, as we did in the past. We never work in isolation but the areas where we need their support will be decided only after the commissions start their work. We need international experts for certain specialised tasks, such as conducting DNA tests and exhuming bodies buried during the insurgency. The way the international community promptly welcomed the new amendment, it seems that the government and political parties were working in close consultation with them. Is that so?As far as I am informed, everything was done by Nepalis. But there was communication with the international agencies. They had earlier expressed their concerns on the ‘zero draft’ and the issues have been addressed. Therefore, they promptly welcomed it. They obviously are involved indirectly because it is a matter the international community is closely watching. But now we may need their direct support to carry out certain specialised tasks.Why didn’t the amendment even mention the use of child soldiers, crime against humanity and war crime?It is a matter of serious consideration as to whether our cases fall under the definition of serious crimes such as crime against humanity. The commissions will study this aspect as well.Don’t you think the provision of reduced sentencing and overlooking of certain legal aspects may promote impunity?Even now, inmates get a waiver of around 50 percent under the regular legal system. So the provision to reduce sentences is already there.But such sentences are reduced only after serving for a certain time and demonstrating good behaviour. Shouldn’t we have adopted a similar approach in this case?Transitional justice system should be seen a bit differently. Here, I give you an example. In Colombia, the TRC of the country summoned the seven secretariat members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). They were first briefed about the charges registered against them. They admitted that they committed the crimes. Then, all of them were acquitted because they spoke the truth. The TRC in Colombia gave priority to finding the truth. If someone showed honesty and cooperated in finding the truth they wouldn’t be punished. But they increased the penalty for those who tried to mislead them through falsehood.Can we say our process is a bit driven by a reparative approach?I again stress that we should look at the transitional justice process differently than how we look at the retributive justice system. It needs a different law, different court and a different jurisprudence.It takes years of rigorous work to complete this process and firm commitment of major political forces is vital. Frequent changes in coalition and unpredictable relations between the political forces is our reality. Don’t you think such instability may hamper this process?This time around, the role of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is very positive. Chiefs of the three biggest parties, while addressing a parliament meeting, have expressed their commitment to make this process successful. Their unity on this matter is important. Not only them, all the political parties represented in the federal parliament, except one lawmaker from a fringe party, have supported this amendment. It has thus become a national issue. I hope this consensus will remain intact while picking officials for the commissions and taking the entire process to a logical end.Given your expertise and involvement in this process, you are being seen as a strong candidate for the TRC chair. What is the reality?I have nothing to say as no one has talked to me about this.

Thousands of people lose their lives in road crashes every year across the country. What are the factors causing these disasters? Why have the authorities failed to prevent them? The Post's Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former secretary Arjun Jung Thapa, who was director general at the Department of Roads for years, to discuss the pressing issue.Why are road accidents taking place so frequently in Nepal? There is no one reason for road accidents. On the infrastructure front, factors like design, condition and geometry of a road are crucial. Putting sign boards along the roads and giving vital information about the particular location is necessary. Those signs should be placed properly so all driving vehicles and passengers can see them clearly. Some technical aspects, such as whether the superelevation is properly designed, particularly at sharp bends, matter greatly. These must be regularly monitored and corrected in time. Regular vehicle fitness tests are essential. Experienced and disciplined drivers are equally important to ensure road safety. Some accidents occur when drivers are unfamiliar with the roads. For instance, the accident that took place at Anbukhaireni of Tanahun district on Friday, killing 27 Indian nationals, might have been because of the driver’s lack of familiarity with the road condition. Yet another serious concern is the lack of road discipline. Those who come to Nepal with years-long experience of driving abroad fear driving because of motorists' reckless driving and lack of lane discipline. The recent accident at Jadibuti, killing one scooter rider, could have been avoided if proper lane discipline had been followed. Reckless driving by motorcyclists has remained a big problem in our case. So, a separate lane should be designated for bikers. Similarly, lanes should be designated for vehicles based on their speed. But such rules are never followed seriously in our case. Traffic police have been entrusted with enforcing traffic rules but lack the human resources to enforce them effectively. We need an integrated and centrally controlled digital traffic light management system. We had experimented with a system as a trial for some time after 2015. We called a bid but couldn’t accept anyone as the bidders proposed more than the rate we had fixed. The project collapsed, and that system could never be revived. We badly lack technology in this sector. When we try to import technology, brokers get involved and ruin the entire process. The condition of roads built haphazardly, mainly in the hills, is another major concern. What do you say about that?We have built around 80,000 kilometres of road across the country. Of that, only around 14,000 kilometres fall under the jurisdiction of the road department. The rest of the road sections fall under the jurisdiction of various authorities, such as the Department of Local Infrastructure and provincial and local governments. The busiest roads are those under the Department of Roads. They are highways and regional roads. Only 50 percent of the roads overseen by the Department of Roads are blacktopped and are not maintained properly. Of the remaining 65,000 kilometres of road, only 4,000 kilometres are blacktopped. This means that the road condition across the country is poor and must be upgraded. The government will now develop the Kakarvitta-Gorusinghe section of the East-West Highway as a safe demonstration corridor. There will be proper infrastructure for crossings, grade-separated intersections, controlled entries, fencing for the safety from wild animals and crossings for wildlife. Local vehicles will run on service lanes. If it is developed as planned, it would be on par with Asian standards. Other roads in the pipeline will follow these standards. These criteria are being implemented while upgrading the Nagdhunga-Mugling road section as well. We have miles to go to upgrade our roads to international standards. Why are we failing to make quality roads?We can’t build our roads according to the original design. At times, locals obstruct road construction and force us to change the alignments. Then, we have to build them based on the availability of the land.Are our rural roads fit from the engineering perspective?Around 35,000 kilometers out of the 65,000 kilometers of roads that don’t fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Roads are built randomly. Local leaders, influential individuals, and bulldozer operators fix the alignments of such roads.How can we rectify the malpractices in this sector?We need to activate the National Road Safety Council urgently. Officials from all the concerned departments and representatives from various stakeholders should sit together in this body and find solutions. Also, coordination has become more complicated in the federal system. For instance, highways are under federal jurisdiction, transport management on highways falls under provincial authority, while road management is under federal jurisdiction. Therefore, an effective coordinating body has become a must. Otherwise, we can’t control the increasing trend of deaths in road accidents. At least 1,700 people lost their lives in 2013, and the then government set a target to reduce it by at least 50 percent by 2020. Instead, the yearly death toll has crossed 2,800 now.While it takes years to complete road upgrading tasks, construction materials are left unmanaged and scattered, making driving along the road very difficult and dangerous. Can’t such things be improved?Contractors are powerful because of their political connection with influential leaders including prime ministers and ministers. Civil servants can’t be assertive when the contractors get political protection. At times, they try to use force to coerce government officials. If the situation is not going in their favour, they provoke locals with a plan to get extension in their contract citing local unrest. Experts say that the government is also to blame as it doesn’t carry out development projects properly. Do you agree?I worked for three decades in government agencies until a few months ago. What I found is that one government devises specific policies, plans and initiates certain projects but successive governments stop them. The new leadership starts its own plans and projects. Then, the contractors don’t get their payment. This is the other side of the story. Another problem is that our ministers, lawmakers and leaders show interest in the projects that deserve the least priority while important projects don’t get attention. For instance, around 30 kilometers of Arniko Highway, which connects Nepal with China, has been badly damaged. This is a very important road for the country. Can’t the government repair and maintain a 30-kilometer section of a highway? It requires just around Rs3 billion whereas leaders have allocated over Rs11.5 billion in the projects of personal interests of leaders. Around Rs4 billion has been allocated under lawmakers’ constituency development programmes and additional Rs5 billion has been earmarked for local bridges. We have allocated around Rs60 billion for non-important projects but we have ignored a crucial road, Arniko Highway, which was built with the support of our neighbour China in the 1960s. Thus we have given unnecessary importance where it doesn’t deserve while ignoring vital development projects. The road accidents are directly or indirectly linked to the government’s wrong policies and plans.Development projects are sometimes said to have failed due to rivalry between some leaders. Do you have any such experience?I will give you an example. In the Biratnagar-Bathnaha cross-border rail project, we had to build over 13 kilometers of the railway. It was around four to five years ago. We cleared over 11 kilometers but locals protested in the remaining section where a station was planned. The locals obstructed work there even as 85 percent of the money for land acquisition had already been distributed. Later, we found that the then minister Aman Lal Modi had provoked the locals to demand for additional money. He demanded a ‘special rate for his men’. But the laws don’t allow it.Some experts argue that to upgrade the quality of our roads, we need to make this sector competitive and, for that, we have to allow the private sector to develop projects. Is it viable?The government is hindering the private sector from entering into this business. They don’t invest without assured returns. They need roads like Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway. The government called for proposals in the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model for this project. They were interested. But the government simultaneously allowed a company to build the Kathmandu-Tunnel Road in the same area. Then the investors felt a risk to invest there. But, the company couldn’t continue the tunnel project. Private sector should be welcomed in this sector but we should create a conducive environment for that. Bangladesh and India have built infrastructure projects under the BOT model. We can do it as well.What do you think about the jurisdictional dispute over the New Road stretch between the Kathmandu Metropolis and the Department of Roads? Who should maintain this road?All the roads within the metropolis fall under the local government’s jurisdiction, as the constitution clearly states. The federal department is managing the roads with the understanding that the local governments are not efficient at maintaining them for now. If a local unit wants to maintain a certain road section on its own, the department should allow it without any dispute. Both sides showed childish behaviour while handling the New Road case.

Three years on, she is now the most vocal leader calling for a unification of the two parties. Why didn’t the new party perform well, and what made her lobby for a party merger? Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat with former minister Jhakri for more insights.You worked actively to form the CPN (Unified Socialist), but the party couldn’t perform well. It couldn’t even become a national party from the general elections. What went wrong?We formed the CPN (Unified Socialist) out of compulsion. When Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli—who was prime minister at the time as well—dissolved the House of Representatives in December 2020, we firmly stood against his move, saying that it sowed the seeds of political instability. We staged huge protests and moved the Supreme Court against the decision of Oli, our party chair at the time. I was among the petitioners. Once the top court reinstated the House, we expected the party to move smoothly. Unfortunately, that couldn’t happen. The party establishment led by Oli and the rival faction took extreme actions against each other. The agitating faction announced action against the party chair, and the party establishment expelled us from the party itself. When Oli dissolved the House a second time, we protested the move as it brought instability. We were in favour of transforming the party through intra-party struggle, but the situation took some unexpected turns. We didn’t quit the party with a lofty plan of making a new revolutionary organisation. We were compelled to do so.Our new party accommodated many genuine leaders who had been sidelined in the UML. But ultimately, old leaders heavily dominated the new party’s central committee. They were active leaders of their time but were out of touch with the new, changing context. Young leaders didn’t get space in party committees. I proposed recruiting at least 40 percent members under 40 years in the central committee and over 50 percent members under 30 years in the district committees. I made a 29-year-old leader the chair of the district committee in my home district. In 42 days, I attended 36 district conventions where youths in their 30s were elected district committee chairs. I tried to reach out to municipalities to promote youths in the party chapters. But at the central level, old faces dominated party committees. That didn’t attract people to the party or impress the general public. Thus, it failed to gather steam right from the beginning.Many think that Madhav Kumar Nepal’s selection as party chief was a wrong move since he had led the UML for 15 years and become prime minister, and people didn’t find novelty in the new party. Do you think so too?Madhav Kumar Nepal has been the most active leader in the party since its inception. Whatever the party has achieved so far is because of him. But a party leader must mobilise teams with defined roles and responsibilities and continuously motivate and engage them in result-oriented tasks. He works a lot but doesn’t mobilise teams effectively. Observers say the Unified Socialist was formed due to the personality clash between top leaders and that it lacked a national agenda and a clear policy to prove the need for a new party. Do you feel so?Our immediate agenda was safeguarding the constitution and ensuring political stability in the country. We protested the House dissolution guided by the same policy. But when provincial governments were made like satellites of the federal government, we couldn’t play any role in stabilising them.The UML is guided by the policy of People’s Multiparty Democracy, propounded by the late Madan Bhandari. There was a debate on further enhancing the policy in the changed context. A large section of Left intellectuals were interested in contributing to that. We could have engaged them in the process. But our party stopped the debate on that topic as well. We missed the chance of engaging many critical individuals in the discourse and having a relatively different policy. When in the UML, we practised direct elections of party representatives and leaders from the conventions. Unfortunately, leaders of the new party, Unified Socialist, made a statute that gave powers to the party leadership to nominate party secretariat, office bearers and other members. Leaders would pick those who are loyal to them. This regressive approach killed competition in the party.You are known to prefer a more proactive work and decision-making approach. There are rumours that you have been fed up with the party’s lacklustre style and are mulling to join the mother party, UML.If I were to decide only from a personal perspective, I would have done so much earlier because I had multiple opportunities in the past. But I am for party merger because I don’t see any relevance of running multiple retail shops under communist banners because we are not substantially different from each other in terms of policies. Our electoral system has also made it necessary. The Unified Socialist can’t run like this. We must accept reality and decide—merging our party with the UML is better than running it this way. But it seems that the top leaders of the twin parties are still bitter about each other.True, the bitterness lingers on, mainly among the top leaders. We have also made some mistakes. The UML offered some opportunities to the Unified Socialist, and we should have made some offers to capitalise on the favourable situation. At one time, UML leaders proposed our party chair as a candidate for the vacant post of the country’s President. We should have devised our own proposal and made a win-win deal. But we ran away and squandered the opportunity. If Madhav Kumar Nepal had become president on the UML’s proposal, our party might have been reunited with the UML much earlier. I also took an initiative to that end but in vain. Later also, UML chair Oli visited our party chair’s residence to have our party on board the government. But the reaction from our side ruined things. We are certainly not responding to the UML responsibly. Rather than irritate the UML, we must turn each positive gesture into an opportunity for party unity.One more factor is blocking the unity between the two parties. There are a large number of second-rung leaders in the UML who can’t directly confront Oli. They are now encouraging former President Bidya Devi Bhandari to join active politics and trying to make decisions in their favour through her. Oli knows these leaders will support Nepal when he returns to the UML. Why would he [Oli] then merge the fringe party and create another power centre against himself? He knows Madhav Kumar Nepal will challenge him with the backing of the dissidents. It is natural for a leader to think twice before allowing another leader of your stature to create a parallel power centre within the organisation. Even I would have thought twice. This is a major factor hindering party unity.Your party chair and other key leaders seem quite close to CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and critical of UML chair Oli. Moreover, Oli often lambasts Madhav Kumar Nepal publicly. Will they still merge the parties?In principle, our party is open for unity with any Left party. But party cadres won’t join the Maoist Centre. If our leadership decides to merge the party with the Maoists, a huge number of our party cadres will join the UML. Unity between the UML and the Unified Socialist is natural because we grew up in the same background and orientation. But we are quite different from Maoists. Several groups trying to form new political outfits have failed to emerge as a major political force and sustain themselves. You worked in a big party for years and also helped establish a new one. What are the challenges of forming a new political organisation in Nepal?Political parties sustain if they evolve with society. If you trace the history of the Nepal’s Congress and communist parties, you will see how they have evolved over the past seven decades. They competed against each other but joined hands to fight autocratic forces towards establishing democracy. They have done hundreds of progressive things in society. Their major fault is that they have multiple entry points but no exit policy. The only exit way is the death of the leaders. This has caused unhealthy practices and created dissident groups.The dissidents who didn’t get any space within their party formed new outfits. They also amplified negative narratives against the old parties. It happened with the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre. Had there been an exit system in the party, the situation wouldn’t be this bad. But new political parties can’t sustain without their own political ideology and orientation. You may form an organisation, cash in on people’s frustration and achieve some immediate gains, but outfits can’t sustain.But recent electoral trends show that Nepalis are seeking alternative forces and new faces. Can we be oblivious to that?You are right. We have seen such trends in the Panchayat system as well. But garnering votes during elections for one term and establishing a sustainable political force are two different things.  ","summary":"CPN (Unified Socialist) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri was among the most active leaders involved in the formation of the party after split with the CPN-UML in 2021.

This is a major factor hindering party unity.Your party chair and other key leaders seem quite close to CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and critical of UML chair Oli. Moreover, Oli often lambasts Madhav Kumar Nepal publicly. Will they still merge the parties?In principle, our party is open for unity with any Left party. But party cadres won’t join the Maoist Centre. If our leadership decides to merge the party with the Maoists, a huge number of our party cadres will join the UML. Unity between the UML and the Unified Socialist is natural because we grew up in the same background and orientation. But we are quite different from Maoists. Several groups trying to form new political outfits have failed to emerge as a major political force and sustain themselves. You worked in a big party for years and also helped establish a new one. What are the challenges of forming a new political organisation in Nepal?Political parties sustain if they evolve with society. If you trace the history of the Nepal’s Congress and communist parties, you will see how they have evolved over the past seven decades. They competed against each other but joined hands to fight autocratic forces towards establishing democracy. They have done hundreds of progressive things in society. Their major fault is that they have multiple entry points but no exit policy. The only exit way is the death of the leaders. This has caused unhealthy practices and created dissident groups.The dissidents who didn’t get any space within their party formed new outfits. They also amplified negative narratives against the old parties. It happened with the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre. Had there been an exit system in the party, the situation wouldn’t be this bad. But new political parties can’t sustain without their own political ideology and orientation. You may form an organisation, cash in on people’s frustration and achieve some immediate gains, but outfits can’t sustain.But recent electoral trends show that Nepalis are seeking alternative forces and new faces. Can we be oblivious to that?You are right. We have seen such trends in the Panchayat system as well. But garnering votes during elections for one term and establishing a sustainable political force are two different things.  "},{"hash":"99d9c3dd7814b0cc31562703dbae02b4a49b2f09cf9a403dc02ac68f26bfdc66","title":"today-s-weather-september-15-2024","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/weather/2024/09/15/today-s-weather-september-15-2024","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/thumb5-1725501375.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1726358400000,"source":"kp","category":"weather","content":"The Meteorological Forecasting Division has predicted partly to generally cloudy skies throughout the country with chances of rain in several provinces on Sunday.Light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is likely in some parts of Koshi Province, Madhesh Province, Bagmati Province, and Gandaki Province, while other regions will experience rain in fewer areas.The forecast also warns of potential heavy rainfall in one or two places in Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces.For tonight, the Division expects cloudy skies across the nation, with chances of light to moderate rain in Koshi Province and isolated areas of Bagmati and Gandaki provinces.The current weather conditions are due to the monsoon trough being positioned around its average location, with monsoon winds affecting the entire country.
