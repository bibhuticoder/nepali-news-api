Jointly led by Prakash Subedi, a Technical Project Manager in BMW's 5G Research and Development team, and his wife, Srishti Gaihre Subedi, a Senior Software Engineer at SAP, the initiative offered students a hands-on glimpse into the world of engineering. After returning from Germany, the couple volunteered their expertise to inspire young minds in Chitwan, conducting this free training to foster enthusiasm for technology and robotics. The program was supported by the German organization GIZ, Diaspora 2030, and the Education Development and Coordination Unit, Chitwan, under the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology, providing local students a unique opportunity to engage with cutting-edge science and technology over an intensive 15-day training period. The workshops, held at SOS Hermann Gmeiner School Bharatpur, Narayani Model Secondary School, and Prembasti Secondary School, reached students from grades 7 to 11, primarily in grades 9 and 10. Each student learned to build and program obstacle-avoiding robots using kits containing Arduino Uno microcontrollers, ultrasonic sensors, servo motors, motor controller boards, and motors. The immersive experience allowed students to gain practical skills in electronics, coding, and robotics, while also encouraging them to explore engineering, artificial intelligence, and problem-solving approaches.Prakash noted the importance of hands-on learning, saying, 'In Germany and other European countries, it's common for students to get practical experience in robotics and programming. However, such opportunities are rare in Nepalese schools. We wanted to provide students with a sense of what's possible in engineering, AI, and problem-solving, helping them understand how technology can be used to tackle real-world challenges and inspiring them to pursue these skills beyond the classroom.' Approximately 40% of participants were girls, indicating a growing interest among both genders in technical fields.\nThe project was made possible with support from the Diaspora 2030 initiative, which connects skilled diaspora professionals with their home countries to foster positive change in education, technology, and skill development. Saurav Koirala from GIZ Kathmandu expressed his happiness with the achievements of the project, highlighting its alignment with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4, which promotes quality education. He remarked that projects like this are vital in raising local educational standards and inspiring students to explore STEM fields.Srishti emphasized her dedication to gender diversity in engineering, saying, 'There are very few females in engineering, and I wanted to motivate students - especially girls - to explore this field.'She shared an emotional moment from the workshop when Bikisha Acharya, a trainee from Prembasti Secondary School, expressed her desire to become an engineer like Srishti. 'It was a very touching experience for me,' Srishti said. 'Knowing that we are inspiring young girls to see themselves in these roles is incredibly meaningful.'\nThe training concluded with a robotics competition titled 'Robo-Quest 2024: Ignite the Spark' at SOS Hermann Gmeiner School. The competition featured 55 students selected from an internal evaluation among the trainees, forming six teams of three from SOS, Narayani Model, and Prembasti schools. SOS Hermann Gmeiner School emerged as the winner, securing a cash prize of 5,000 NPR, with Prembasti Secondary School and Narayani Model Secondary School securing the second and third places, winning 4,000 and 3,000 NPR, respectively. \nBishnu Prasad Bhattarai, Unit Chief of the Education Development and Coordination Unit, Chitwan, and Bhumi Lal Sharma Subedi, Undersecretary at the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology, praised the initiative, stating, 'Training and competitions like these attract students toward science and technology.

The markets would turn into a bustling and happening places, Karki recollected, adding that he only saw two groups performing Deusi-Bhailo programme.\nKarki attributed the shrink in the Deusi-Bhailo group due to the increasing exodus of youths, especially skilled performers (artists) for foreign employment and for abroad studies as well.\n\"This year, the Aama Samuha and higher secondary school students' were seen performing Deusi-Bhailo. The impact of outflow of youths is starting to be seen in the culture of playing Deusi-Bhailo,\" he shared. \nGokul Sunar, chairperson of an organization of the folk music artists, said there had been fewer younger women and men during the Tihar lately. According to Sunar, many young folks in the district have sought employment overseas while local residents were busy in agricultural works. \nWith none to take forward the Deusi-Bhailo programme exuberantly and keep up with its sanctity, he worried over the disappearance of this joyous tradition believed to be practiced since the reign of Bali Raja in Hindu legend.\nSkilled and esteemed artists such as Raj Kumar Pariyar, Soniya Pun, Gokul Pun, Milan Thapa Magar among others have sought greener pastures, contributing to the dearth of artists for the cultural performances. \nTo address the talent shortage and to conserve the tradition and customs of Deusi-Bhailo, Sunar said that they had trained new troupe of artists.

The markets would turn into a bustling and happening places, Karki recollected, adding that he only saw two groups performing Deusi-Bhailo programme.\nKarki attributed the shrink in the Deusi-Bhailo group due to the increasing exodus of youths, especially skilled performers (artists) for foreign employment and for abroad studies as well.\n\"This year, the Aama Samuha and higher secondary school students' were seen performing Deusi-Bhailo. The impact of outflow of youths is starting to be seen in the culture of playing Deusi-Bhailo,\" he shared. \nGokul Sunar, chairperson of an organization of the folk music artists, said there had been fewer younger women and men during the Tihar lately. According to Sunar, many young folks in the district have sought employment overseas while local residents were busy in agricultural works. \nWith none to take forward the Deusi-Bhailo programme exuberantly and keep up with its sanctity, he worried over the disappearance of this joyous tradition believed to be practiced since the reign of Bali Raja in Hindu legend.\nSkilled and esteemed artists such as Raj Kumar Pariyar, Soniya Pun, Gokul Pun, Milan Thapa Magar among others have sought greener pastures, contributing to the dearth of artists for the cultural performances. \nTo address the talent shortage and to conserve the tradition and customs of Deusi-Bhailo, Sunar said that they had trained new troupe of artists.

Accordingly, the government has intensified preparations. In the taskforce, the Congress is represented by General Secretary Gagan Thapa and advocate Semanta Dahal, while representing the UML are the prime minister’s two aides—Bishnu Rimal and Yubaraj Khatiwada, Oli’s political and economic advisor, respectively. The task force will undertake a comprehensive review of the BRI implementation plan proposed by China.According to ministers familiar with the matter, during Tuesday’s meeting, Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba objected when Oli expressed his desire to sign a BRI-related deal BRI during his China visit. Deuba reportedly reiterated Congress’ official position that Nepal should not take high-interest loans to fund BRI projects. Besides Deuba, senior Congress leaders including Vice President Purna Bahadur Khadka, Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and General Secretary Thapa were present at the meeting. According to leaders present at the meeting, Oli told Deuba and Congress leaders that he has made up his mind to sign the BRI implementation plan and wants to sign some projects under the BRI funding modality.“But Deuba objected. He reminded Oli of the official decision of Nepali Congress that the party is against high-interest loans and favours grants to fund projects. Deuba also raised concerns over several components of the BRI implementation plan and insisted that the plan focus on cooperation in infrastructure and development, and avoid contentious areas,” a Congress leader told the Post.Deuba has also made several changes to the proposed draft sent by the Chinese side and handed over the revised copy to Prime Minister Oli for his consideration, said the Congress leader. The new task force will address Congress’ concerns and come up with an alternative draft ahead of Oli’s departure for China.The task force is mandated to revise the Chinese-proposed draft implementation plan prioritising development of infrastructure projects, according to multiple Congress and UML leaders. According to them, both Oli and Deuba are on the same page on the BRI concept, but the Congress has been insisting on grants to fund BRI projects.“The task force is mandated to come up with a new draft by addressing the concerns raised by the Congress, some external forces and even the bureaucracy. The government needs to take external forces like India and the US into confidence and needs to maintain a balance with India. Taking note of all these concerns, the task force will revise the draft of the BRI implementation plan. The Nepal government has already communicated to the Chinese side that a revised draft will be shared, and they seem to have agreed,” said a Congress party leader. A second UML leader confirmed the Congress leader’s take.The leaders said Nepali bureaucrats have also raised concerns over the projects’ funding modality. “We should reject new and untested funding modalities,” a secretary at the prime minister’s office said, while stating the reservation of different ministries. “Proposals like a blended financing model and similar other models will be rejected.”Home Minister Lekhak also reiterated his party’s favour of grants. A meeting of the Congress on July 14, just a day ahead of Prime Minister Oli’s swearing-in, had decided to prioritise grants over loans for implementing the BRI projects.“The Congress and the UML have different views on receiving economic support under the BRI framework, but we are working to come to an understanding. The UML also has not insisted on loans, so we are discussing how to move ahead and will come up with a common position before the prime minister’s visit,” said Lekhak. The two-party taskforce formally began its work on Thursday. “Once the taskforce completes its revision of the BRI implementation plan, we will forward the text to the Chinese side to get their nod,” a minister told the Post.The government has started selecting projects to be developed under the BRI framework and with Chinese economic support.

Cholera outbreaks are not new to Nepal, as they are recorded every year, especially in the monsoon season.Nepal witnessed a massive cholera outbreak during this year’s monsoon. At least 95 cases of cholera infection were confirmed in Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Kailali, Pyuthan, Makawanpur, Rolpa, Sindhupalchok, Achham and Rautahat districts. Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype was found in the stool samples of the infected patients. Hundreds of people suffered from the diarrheal infection that continued for months.In 2022, too, the Kathmandu Valley witnessed a massive cholera outbreak with at least 77 confirmed cases. Officials said that the outbreaks were reported in districts that have active case surveillance programmes. Active cholera surveillance is being carried out from 27 health facilities in the Valley and 10 in the Kailali district.“We are also working to declare sentinel surveillance sites, at least one in each province, for active surveillance of cholera,” said Ghimire. “Discussions are underway to launch mass vaccination campaigns in high-risk districts.”Officials said that the cholera elimination plan needs to be approved by the Department of Health Services and the Ministry of Health and Population. If both agencies agree that vaccination is the most effective way to halt cholera outbreaks, the agencies concerned can approach aid agencies for vaccine doses.Health authorities had administered oral cholera vaccine in wards 11, 12 and 13 of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, which were severely affected by the disease outbreak in May last year. Public health experts say that the risk of waterborne diseases, including cholera, will not lessen until and unless the country's water and sanitation conditions improve, and people are ensured safe drinking water. Several other factors, including the condition of supply pipes, water storage, and pollution in water sources, impact the quality of water supplied to households.“Mass cholera vaccination is only a short-term solution,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Our focus should be on improving water and sanitation conditions.”Due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, Nepal is highly vulnerable to water-borne diseases, including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people falling sick every year. Health officials said the cholera elimination plan focuses on improving water, sanitation, and hygiene programmes, with support from development partners, including the World Health Organisation, Unicef, and other agencies.A study carried out by the Health Ministry following an outbreak last year showed that nearly 70 percent of drinking water samples in Kathmandu Valley were contaminated with E coli and faecal coliform.Doctors say the only ways to save people from dying from water-borne diseases, including cholera, are to launch awareness drives and ensure safe drinking water. According to them, a combination of surveillance, water, sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection.The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health, and a multifaceted approach is key to controlling the disease and reducing deaths.

Lamichhane, among other individuals, is accused of embezzling deposits from Kathmandu-based Swarnalaxmi Cooperative, Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Cooperative, Butwal-based Supreme Cooperative and Bharatpur-based Sahara Chitwan Cooperative.RSP announced protest programmes in Pokhara and Kathmandu on October 19, a day after Lamichhane's arrest, claiming that the party chief’s arrest was politically motivated.The party also staged demonstrations in Bhairahawa when Lamichhane was taken in custody for interrogation for his involvement in misappropriating funds from the Supreme Cooperative based in Butwal. However, the RSP, which has announced the second phase of its protest for November 23, has decided to change its strategy.The party’s central committee meeting on Tuesday witnessed division among the central committee members over the modality of protest. Then the meeting on November 20 eventually decided to change the format for the second-phase protest. “Few leaders at the central committee meeting argued that the second phase of protest should not be different from the first one,” a central committee member of the party told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “But, in view of the protest’s little public appeal, the party decided to change its form in the second phase.”However, central committee member Hari Dhakal, who is also a lawmaker, refuted the claim. Dhakal argued that the party decided to change the protest format considering the by-election scheduled for December 1, in which the RSP has fielded its candidacy in 27 out of 44 seats up for grabs.“This time, we plan to make the people aware of our agenda through the election campaign. Therefore, all the protests ahead are not street-centric,” Dhakal told the Post.According to the party leaders privy to the developments, despite Dhakal's claim, some who spoke at the November 19 central committee meeting argued that the public was not interested in the agenda they pursued following Lamichhane’s arrest.Dhakal agreed that the RSP often seemed confused while making a political decision after the party chair’s arrest. Lamichhane has so far not given any definite role to other leaders to oversee the party affairs in his absence. “Naturally, a new party like ours will have a certain kind of dilemma in the absence of the main leader,” Dhakal added. “However, this does not mean that the political activities of our party have come to a standstill.”In a country like Nepal, it is natural that parties are often individual-centric, and the RSP is not different, says a political analyst. “In a leader-centric party, it is natural that the absence of central leadership often puts the party in a tight spot while taking major political decisions,” Chiranjibi Bhandari, a political analyst who is also an assistant professor at the central department of Conflict, Peace and Development Studies, told the Post. Following its impressive performance in the 2022 general elections and the 2023 by-elections, many observers extrapolated a mighty electoral success for the RSP in the following years. In their reckoning, the party was expected to challenge the Nepali Congress and the UML, the two oldest and biggest players of Nepali politics, in the national elections due in 2027.However, everything was not well with the party. When the RSP candidate fared badly in the Ilam-2 by-election held in April, the party’s leaders drew up a conclusion that something had gone wrong with the party organisation. Then, the RSP entrusted then-party general secretary Mukul Dhakal with touring various parts of the country and studying the matter. Dhakal, the party's founding general secretary, visited 38 districts and submitted a review report to the party committee. As Dhakal also leaked the report to the media it caused a storm within the party as his finding chiefly blamed chair Lamichhane for the party’s diminishing image in the public.The report resulted in Dhakal's expulsion from the party.The problem deepened when the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate the crisis-ridden cooperatives implicated the party’s chair in a case of cooperatives funds misuse. While the party rank and file vehemently denied the claim, Lamichhane’s arrest came as a big blow to the RSP.Some current indications are certainly not encouraging for RSP leaders. The party reportedly found no candidate for the Kirtipur mayoral election scheduled for December 1.The Ilam and Kirtipur episodes suggest that the RSP has failed to expand its command down to the grassroots, experts say.Senior vice-president of RSP, DP Aryal acknowledged that his party failed to find an appropriate candidate in Kirtipur Municipality, which could be normal for any other party. “We were looking for a candidate who could carry the values and principles of our party,” Aryal told the Post. “After not finding an appropriate candidate in Kirtipur Municipality, we took a decision to not field anyone who could not champion the principles and values of our party.” The RSP sent a chilling message to the major traditional forces when it emerged the fourth largest party in the November 2022 election, just six months after its establishment. In the 2023 by-elections, it gained one more seat.However, within two years, the party was in a position to change its protest format, claiming it was failing to attract public support. Does this signal the party is in serious trouble?“New political parties like the RSP got traction due to the public disenchantment towards the traditional political parties, not because of their own political agenda,” said Bhandari. “The party has yet to prove itself in the public eye.” Political analyst Bhandari further added that they might have switched the protest format after the earlier one did not work. “It, however, would be too early to call it a downfall of the party,” he added.“The party is indeed in a dilemma after Lamichhane’s arrest. However, shifting the protest strategy cannot be termed otherwise,” Bhandari said. ","summary":"A series of events unfolding at least for the past eight months has pushed the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) into a difficult situation, leaving the leaders of the two-year-old party confused.The RSP leaders look more perplexed following the arrest of party president Rabi Lamichhane on the allegations of involvement in embezzling tens of millions of rupees from various cooperatives.Police arrested Lamichhane, who is also a former deputy prime minister and home minister, from the party’s central office in Kathmandu on October 18 following an arrest warrant from the Kaski District Court.After that district courts in Rupandehi, Kathmandu and Chitwan also issued arrest warrants against Lamichhane and others on charges of embezzling funds from the cooperatives. Lamichhane, among other individuals, is accused of embezzling deposits from Kathmandu-based Swarnalaxmi Cooperative, Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Cooperative, Butwal-based Supreme Cooperative and Bharatpur-based Sahara Chitwan Cooperative.RSP announced protest programmes in Pokhara and Kathmandu on October 19, a day after Lamichhane's arrest, claiming that the party chief’s arrest was politically motivated.The party also staged demonstrations in Bhairahawa when Lamichhane was taken in custody for interrogation for his involvement in misappropriating funds from the Supreme Cooperative based in Butwal.

The construction of the project, too, faces uncertainty.The project is important from the energy security point of view. Except for Kulekhani, all other power projects are run-of-the-river undertakings whose capacity dips to as low as 40 percent in the dry season.Because of the dominance of run-of-the-river projects, Nepal has been forced to buy electricity from India during winter, even though the country has an energy surplus in summer. According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, Nepal’s total installed capacity has reached 3,157MW.The government has already spent over Rs42 billion paying compensation for acquiring land for the Budhi Gandaki project.As the project failed to move, it has put everyone, including the landowners, in a dilemma.The total land required for the project components is 56.22 hectares, and 49.62 hectares of it will be occupied permanently.Even the blacktopping of a section of Mid-hill Highway has been stopped. Locals say construction and development activities have stalled in the areas affected by the project. Arughat Bazaar, which carries 300 years of history, looks deserted.“Before the construction of the Prithvi Highway in 1971, people from Kaski had to reach Kathmandu via Arughat Bazaar-Trishuli. Arughat used to be a place for people and traders to shelter,” said Buddhi Prasad Shrestha, a local of Arughat rural municipality-9.“Though the construction of Prithvi Highway shadowed Arughat, the local business was not down.”However, with the stopping of the transaction of the project-affected land, the construction of new houses has completely stopped. “People affected by the earthquakes of 2015 have not been able to construct houses.”Traders said that business has declined by 70 percent in Arughat.Before the government started acquiring land to build the project, the local traders of Chumnumbri, Dharche, and Arughat bought goods in Arughat. Land transactions in Arughat for settlement also boomed.The market was vibrant as people migrated to Arughat for children's education. Trekkers' flow to Manaslu trails also kept the market busy.But after the earthquake of April 2015, the market started losing its charm, locals said.“Gorkha Bazaar was a happening market then of Dhading Besi, but now the business is not even 10 percent,” said Prem Kumar Shrestha, a resident of Bishalnagar, Dhading.He said that as development work has stalled, labourers are unable to find work.After the earthquake and the Covid pandemic, 70 percent of locals are estimated to have left Arughat.With fewer business activities, small businesses are in trouble.“We are in a dilemma. The businesses cannot expand because no one knows when the government will ask them to leave or vacate the areas for construction,” said Prem Kumar.The locals who received the compensation for their land have shifted to Kathmandu and Chitwan. “The ward also does not allocate a budget for development,” said Ganesh Kumar Shrestha. As people migrate to new places, people like Ganesh Kumar are confused as they do not know where to go. “I have to start from zero in the new place. It’s difficult,” he said.“If the hydropower moves forward prioritising the re-settlement, it will remove the confusion,” said Ganesh Kumar. Thakur Prasad Khanal left Manuwa-1 and purchased five ana land in Bishal Nagar. “We were surviving on agricultural and farm yields. Customers used to come to our field to buy vegetables. But now it's hard to sell even a bunch of green leafy vegetables or buffalo milk,” said Khanal. With no business, locals like Khanal say they had to quit farming.People like Khanal said that the project also did not provide fair compensation.“I have two ana of land.

But the compensation I received is Rs1.4 million,” said Khanal. “The compensation is discriminatory.”Buddhi Prasad Shrestha of Arughat-9 said around 150 locals in Arughat Bazaar living on unregistered land and 100 tenants who built structures by leasing lands have not received compensation.“Some locals have been living in Arughat for business leasing land since the Panchayat era. The project should address their grievances, too,” said Buddhi Prasad.An initial environmental assessment report stated that the people affected by the project would be resettled on the two sides, making a ring road, said Hareram Dhakal, coordinator of Budhi Gandaki Hydropower Project National Concern Committee.“Ring road has not been built yet.Around Rs500 million has been allocated in the current fiscal year. “It’s peanuts,” said Dhakal.Madhu Prasad Bhetwal, the project chief, said that Rs42.68 billion, or 95 percent of compensation, has been distributed to the project-affected people in Gorkha and Dhading.

From August the ban included singing, reading aloud, reciting poetry and even laughing outside their homes.The Taliban’s ministry for the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice, which implements one of the most radical interpretations of Islamic law, enforces these rules. They are part of a broader set of “vice and virtue” laws that severely restrict women’s rights and freedoms. Women are even banned from reading the Quran out loud to other women in public.In the past three years in Afghanistan, the Taliban has taken away many basic rights from women who live there, so that there’s very little that they are allowed to do. From 2021, the Taliban started introducing restrictions on girls receiving education, starting with a ban on coeducation and then a ban on girls attending secondary schools. This was followed by closing blind girls’ schools in 2023, and making it mandatory for girls in grades four to six (ages nine to 12) to cover their faces on the way to school.Women can no longer attend universities or receive a degree certificate nationally, or follow midwifery or nursing training in the Kandahar region. Women are no longer allowed to be flight attendants, or to take a job outside the home. Women-run bakeries in the capital Kabul have now been banned. Women are mostly now unable to earn any money, or leave their homes. In April 2024, the Taliban in Helmand province told media outlets to even refrain from airing women’s voices.Afghanistan is ranked last on the Women, Peace and Security Index and officials at the UN and elsewhere have called it “gender apartheid”. Afghan women are putting their lives on the line—facing surveillance, harassment, assault, arbitrary detention, torture and exile—to protest against the Taliban.Many diplomats discuss how important it is to “engage” with the Taliban, yet this has not stopped the assault on women’s rights. When diplomats “engage”, they tend to focus on counter-terrorism, counternarcotics, business deals, or hostage returns. Despite everything that has happened to Afghan women over a short period, critics suggest this rarely makes it onto diplomats’ priority list.Iraq’s age of consentMeanwhile, in Iraq, on August 4 2024, an amendment to Iraq’s 1959 personal status law which would possibly lower the age of consent for marriage to nine years old from 18 (or 15 with permission from a judge and parents) was proposed by member of parliament Ra’ad al-Maliki and supported by conservative Shia factions in the government.The law would have the potential of having matters of family law—such as marriage—adjudicated by religious authorities. This change could not only legalise child marriage but also strip women of rights related to divorce, child custody and inheritance.Iraq already has a high rate of underage marriage, with 7 percent of girls married by 15 years old, and 28 percent married before the legal age of 18. Unregistered marriages, not legally recorded in court but conducted through religious or tribal authorities, prevent girls from accessing civil rights, and leave women and girls vulnerable to exploitation, abuse and neglect, with limited options for seeking justice.Many women’s groups have already mobilised against the law. But the amendment has passed its second reading in parliament. If introduced, it could pave the way for further modifications that deepen sectarian divides and move the country further away from a unified legal system. It would also be an especially troubling step backward in protecting children’s rights and gender equality.Abortion rights in the USMeanwhile, in the US, women’s access to abortion has been eroded significantly in the past few years. In late 2021, the US was officially labelled a backsliding democracy by an international thinktank. Six months later, the landmark US Supreme Court ruling of Roe v Wade, which had safeguarded the constitutional right to abortion for nearly 50 years, was overturned. This led to a cascade of restrictive laws, with more than a quarter of US states enacting outright bans or severe restrictions on abortion.Republican US congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene suggested, in May 2022, that women should stay celibate if they did not want to get pregnant. If only all women had that choice. In fact, in the US a sexual assault occurs every 68 seconds. One in every five American women has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape. From 2009-13, US Child Protective Services agencies found strong evidence indicating that 63,000 children per year were victims of sexual abuse.These developments reflect a troubling pattern. There is evidence from Donald Trump’s first term that there could be further erosion of women’s rights in his second presidency. During his previous term there were significant attempts to weaken healthcare access, with his foreign policy reinstating the “global gag rule” restricting access to women’s reproductive healthcare worldwide via funding conditions.Fragility of women’s rightsIf the world can tolerate the Taliban’s abuses, Iraq’s restrictive laws and the US restrictions on abortion access, it reveals the fragility of women’s and girls’ rights globally, and how easy it is to take them away.The UN agency, UN Women, says it could take another 286 years to close the global gender gaps in legal protections. No country has yet achieved gender equality, based on the gender pay gap, legal equality and social inequality levels. Women and girls continue to face discrimination in all corners of the world, and it seems to be getting worse. But despite everything women continue to resist.—The ConversationRead the original article here.

Local power companies did not want to pay the prices the state company was offering, jeopardizing the deal, according to US authorities. To save the deal, Adani allegedly decided to bribe local officials to persuade them to buy the electricity.That allegation is at the heart of US criminal and civil charges unsealed on Wednesday against Adani, who is not currently in US custody and is believed to be in India. His company, Adani Group, said the charges were “baseless” and that it would seek “all possible legal recourse.”The alleged hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes promised to local Indian officials caught the attention of the US Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission as Adani’s companies were raising funds from US-based investors in several transactions starting in 2021.This account of how the alleged scheme unfolded is drawn from federal prosecutors’ 54-page criminal indictment of Adani and seven of his associates and two parallel civil SEC complaints which extensively cite electronic messages between the scheme’s alleged participants.In early 2020, the Solar Energy Corporation of India awarded Adani Green Energy (ADNA.NS) and another company, Azure Power Global (AZREF.PK), contracts for a 12-gigawatt solar energy project, expected to yield billions of dollars in revenue for both companies, according to the indictment.It was a major step forward for Adani Green Energy, run by Adani’s nephew, Sagar Adani. Up until that point, the company had only earned roughly $50 million in its history and had yet to turn a profit, according to the SEC complaint.But the initiative soon hit roadblocks. Local state electricity distributors were reluctant to commit to buying the new solar power, expecting prices to fall in the future, according to an April 7, 2021 report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a think tank.Sagar Adani and the Azure CEO at the time discussed the delays and hinted at bribes on the encrypted messaging application WhatsApp, according to the SEC.When the Azure CEO wrote on Nov. 24, 2020, that the local power companies “are being motivated,” Sagar Adani allegedly replied, “Yup ... but the optics are very difficult to cover. In February 2021, Sagar Adani allegedly wrote to the CEO, “Just so you know, we have doubled the incentives to push for these acceptances.”The SEC did not name the Azure CEO as a defendant, but Azure’s securities filings show the CEO at the time was Ranjit Gupta.Gupta was charged by the Justice Department with conspiracy to violate an anti-bribery law.

The agency sent a “general inquiry” letter to Azure - which at the time traded on the New York Stock Exchange - on March 17, 2022, asking about its recent contracts and if foreign officials had sought anything of value, according to the Justice Department indictment.According to the Department of Justice, Gautam Adani told representatives of Azure during a meeting in his Ahmedabad, India office the next month that he expected to be reimbursed more than $80 million for the bribes he had paid officials that ultimately benefited Azure’s contracts.Some Azure representatives and a leading investor in the company decided to pay Adani back by allowing his company to take over a potentially profitable project. The representatives and investor allegedly agreed to tell Azure’s board of directors that Adani had requested bribe money, but hid their role in the scheme, prosecutors said.All the while, Adani’s companies were raising billions of dollars in loans and bonds through international banks, including from US investors.

The agents handed him a search warrant from a judge indicating that the US government was investigating potential violations of fraud statutes and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.According to prosecutors, Gautam Adani emailed himself photographs of each page of the search warrant on March 18, 2023.His companies nonetheless went through with a $1.36 billion syndicated loan agreement on Dec. 5, 2023, and another sale of secured notes in March 2024, and once again furnished investors with misleading information about their anti-bribery practices, according to prosecutors.On Oct. 24, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn secured a secret grand jury indictment against Gautam Adani, Sagar Adani, Gupta, and five others allegedly involved in the scheme.The indictment was unsealed on Nov. 20, prompting a $27 billion plunge in Adani Group companies’ market value. Adani Green Energy promptly canceled a scheduled $600 million bond sale.  ","summary":"In June of 2020, a renewable energy company owned by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani won what it called the single largest solar development bid ever awarded: an agreement to supply 8 gigawatts of electricity to a state-owned power company.But there was a problem. Local power companies did not want to pay the prices the state company was offering, jeopardizing the deal, according to US authorities. To save the deal, Adani allegedly decided to bribe local officials to persuade them to buy the electricity.That allegation is at the heart of US criminal and civil charges unsealed on Wednesday against Adani, who is not currently in US custody and is believed to be in India. His company, Adani Group, said the charges were “baseless” and that it would seek “all possible legal recourse.”The alleged hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes promised to local Indian officials caught the attention of the US Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission as Adani’s companies were raising funds from US-based investors in several transactions starting in 2021.This account of how the alleged scheme unfolded is drawn from federal prosecutors’ 54-page criminal indictment of Adani and seven of his associates and two parallel civil SEC complaints which extensively cite electronic messages between the scheme’s alleged participants.In early 2020, the Solar Energy Corporation of India awarded Adani Green Energy (ADNA.NS) and another company, Azure Power Global (AZREF.PK), contracts for a 12-gigawatt solar energy project, expected to yield billions of dollars in revenue for both companies, according to the indictment.It was a major step forward for Adani Green Energy, run by Adani’s nephew, Sagar Adani. Up until that point, the company had only earned roughly $50 million in its history and had yet to turn a profit, according to the SEC complaint.But the initiative soon hit roadblocks. Local state electricity distributors were reluctant to commit to buying the new solar power, expecting prices to fall in the future, according to an April 7, 2021 report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a think tank.Sagar Adani and the Azure CEO at the time discussed the delays and hinted at bribes on the encrypted messaging application WhatsApp, according to the SEC.When the Azure CEO wrote on Nov. 24, 2020, that the local power companies “are being motivated,” Sagar Adani allegedly replied, “Yup ... but the optics are very difficult to cover. In February 2021, Sagar Adani allegedly wrote to the CEO, “Just so you know, we have doubled the incentives to push for these acceptances.”The SEC did not name the Azure CEO as a defendant, but Azure’s securities filings show the CEO at the time was Ranjit Gupta.Gupta was charged by the Justice Department with conspiracy to violate an anti-bribery law.

Conducted by the city’s mental health welfare centre from Aug 8 to 14, it assessed 102 residents living close to the border in Wolgot-myeon and Haseong-myeon.The data indicates that two individuals fell into a “high-risk category” for mental health issues, while 27 were labelled as being in a “watch” category, dealing with notable symptoms of stress and anxiety. The remaining 73 residents were considered to be within a normal range.Predominantly affecting the elderly population – many in their 70s and 80s – the noise has resulted in symptoms, such as sleep disorders, heightened stress and anxiety. These symptoms have been reported since the broadcasts started last September, making their daily lives increasingly intolerable, according to the assessment.The broadcasts, which consist of peculiar sounds like sirens and metal clanging, stop and start repeatedly at all hours, with a range of noise levels, according to local reports.“The eerie, metal-grinding sounds permeate the day and night from the North, depriving us of sleep and making daily life a challenge due to constant fear and anxiety,” one resident described.“We plan to offer psychological counselling and psychiatric treatment for those interested, aiming to enhance residents’ mental stability,” a Gimpo city official said.“Additionally, we are proposing measures to the Gyeonggi province and the central government, including temporary housing support, and installation of soundproof windows and doors.”North Korean broadcasts have also caused residents of Ganghwa-gun, Incheon, to suffer.The Incheon government plans to install soundproof facilities in the Dangsan-ri area, starting in early 2025.The noises, first reported in late July and described as high-pitched and similar to scraping metal, also feature sirens and drums and persist around the clock.Officials in Seoul believe this may be a retaliatory measure by the North against South Korea’s resumption of loudspeaker broadcasts earlier that month.

It said operations will continue as normal during the bankruptcy.“Northvolt’s liquidity picture has become dire,” the company said in its Chapter 11 petition, filed in US Bankruptcy Court in Houston. The company, which has operations in California, has about $30 million of cash, which can support its operations for only about a week. It has $5.8 billion in debts.Northvolt, which employs around 6,600 staff across seven countries, said it expects to complete the restructuring by the first quarter of 2025.Northvolt transformed in a matter of months from Europe’s best shot at a homegrown electric-vehicle battery champion to a company struggling to stay afloat by slimming down, hobbled by production problems, the loss of a major customer and a lack of funding.Europe has been hoping that Northvolt would reduce Western car makers’ reliance on Chinese rivals such as battery maker CATL, and EV and battery maker BYD.Northvolt said the $100 million in a new loan is part of $245 million in financing support for the bankruptcy. Swedish truck maker Scania, a shareholder and its biggest customer said on Thursday that it was loaning $100 million to Northvolt to support the manufacturing of electric vehicle battery cells in Skellefteå, northern Sweden.“This decisive step will allow Northvolt to continue its mission to establish a homegrown, European industrial base for battery production,” Tom Johnstone, interim chairman of Northvolt’s board, said in a statement, noting the support Northvolt has received from existing lenders and customers.As part of the restructuring, Northvolt will evaluate proposals for new money investment from strategic and financial investors, as well as existing lenders, shareholders and customers, he said.Volkswagen, Northvolt’s top shareholder with a 21% stake, said it had taken note of the filing and was in close contact with the Swedish firm. It declined to comment on potential repercussions on its own business.STIFF COMPETITIONInvestment group Vargas, a co-founder of Northvolt and one of its largest shareholders, said the bankruptcy would allow the company to address financial challenges and maintain its competitive edge in producing high-performance battery cells.Handelsbanken analyst Hampus Engellau said the bankruptcy filing would give the company some short-term breathing space. Even so, he said, “This tells us that they haven’t found investors and raised the capital needed to restructure their business.”Northvolt had been discussing the possibility of filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States as one of several options for survival, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last week.Northvolt has led a wave of European startups investing tens of billions of dollars in battery production to serve the continent’s automakers as they switch from internal-combustion engines to EVs.But EV demand is growing at a slower pace than some in the industry had projected, and competition remains stiff from China, which controls 85% of global battery-cell production, according to International Energy Agency data.At a court hearing late Thursday, US Bankruptcy Judge Alfredo Perez approved some routine initial steps in Northvolt’s bankruptcy, including allowing the company to pay wages owed to employees and draw the first $51 million of the Scania loan.On Monday, Reuters reported that Northvolt had missed some in-house targets and curtailed production at its battery-cell plant in Skellefteå, underscoring the challenge of ramping up output.The company’s court filing on Thursday said it had capacity to produce 300,000 batteries a year.In October, Northvolt struck a deal that gave access to a small amount of money while talks on a bigger financing package continued, Business Daily DI reported.Those talks had become more difficult in recent weeks, one of the sources familiar with the Chapter 11 plan said.In recent years several Swedish companies have opted for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filings, such as Scandinavian airline SAS and debt collector Intrum, a process that allows management to retain control over the company and run operations.Swedish Deputy Prime Minister Ebba Busch said on social media platform X that the government continues to support the EV battery industry and hopes that the restructuring will help turn around Northvolt’s fortunes.

The local unit has reported cases of infection from the deadly virus this year too.Although most cases were locally transmitted, health workers in the district don’t consider the virus spread a serious public health problem. This is because Jumla is among the coldest places in the country, with temperatures dipping to subzero levels in the winter.Studies, however, show a disturbing development.“My study shows the presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and their larvae in Chandannath Municipality,” said Buddhi Ram Oli, a PhD scholar at the Central Department of Zoology of the Tribhuvan University. “Chandannath Municipality is located at an elevation of 2,438 metres, and this is the first time that dengue virus-spreading mosquitoes and their larvae have been found at such a high altitude.”Earlier, vectors spreading the deadly disease were recorded only up to 2,100 metres.Local residents and health officials serving in Jumla are aware of the presence of vectors spreading deadly diseases and growing number of infections. But they don’t take the issue seriously, thinking that the vectors cannot survive long due to the climatic conditions of the region.“We once met officials at District Health Office Jumla and discussed launching an awareness drive and destroying breeding sites of mosquitoes,” said Chhatra Bahadur Mahat, health coordinator at the Chandannath Municipality. “But neither does the health office provide a budget for such programmes nor does the local unit allocate any funds. So we couldn’t do anything.”Along with Jumla, all districts across the country have recorded dengue infections this year.Oli, who carried out vector surveillance, said that, as in Chandannath Municipality, health workers at other local units too have not taken the risk of the virus-spread seriously.Experts say the country’s health workers and health facilities are ill prepared to cope with the emerging public health challenges brought about by climate change. Several health facilities were overwhelmed with dengue patients this year, too. Due to a lack of beds, patients were forced to sleep in corridors, on the floor, on chairs, in storerooms, and out in the hospital compound. Hospitals even lacked basic supplies like IV stands, and patients’ visitors had to hold the IV bags or health workers had to improvise by tying them to windows.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed with an influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks and are vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and surges in patient flow.”Experts say climate change, along with some other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, has been contributing to the spread of deadly diseases in places considered no-risk zones in the past.“The rise in the temperature caused by climate change provides a conducive environment for dengue vectors to thrive and spread in the mountainous areas,” said Dhimal. “Risks posed by climatic factors cannot be ignored or underestimated.”A report by the United Nations titled ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’ states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organisation, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.So far, 12 people have died due to dengue and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often conceal the actual number of deaths and infections.This year, districts in Tarai region reported fewer cases of dengue infection than districts in the hills and mountains. Experts attribute this to the residents of Tarai’s becoming more aware of the deadly virus and taking preventive measures. High temperatures (above 35 degrees Celsius) could also have contributed to less infection, as mosquito vectors do not survive above 35 degrees Celsius.Over the past few years, dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal, with cases consistently on the rise.

Making matters worse is the Nepali government’s silence even though the goods have not been sold to India for months.Dol Raj Adhikari, president of the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, said sanitary pads and diapers worth of Rs250 million had been stranded in the warehouses for the past three months.“We completed all the processes to acquire the Bureau of Indian Standards [BIS] certificate to export our products, but no team from India is coming to inspect the factory. We even wrote to the Indian authority multiple times but our requests have fallen on deaf ears.”As per the provision, once the Indian inspection team gives a green signal after factory inspection, goods can be exported to India.In 2020, the Indian government asked the BIS to prescribe mandatory standards for imported goods in line with international quality norms. The move aimed to prevent Chinese goods from entering India from any of its neighbours.After the suppression of Chinese apps, the Indian government imposed import restrictions on more than 370 Chinese products. Insiders say India does not want any products from Nepal that have Chinese components, including Nepal’s hydroelectricity, greatly worrying Nepal’s top exporters.The BIS deals with the marking and certifying of goods, incorporating quality standards and information on international norms to be followed while importing.The rules worry Adhikari, who owns the AG Health Industries Private Limited that produces sanitary pads and diapers in Bhairahawa. “India seems intent to halt imports from Nepal,” said Adhikari. According to the association, Nepal used to export three truckloads of sanitary pads and diapers daily. There are 29 sanitary pads and diaper factories in Nepal, both large and small, employing 6,000 workers.Sanitary pads and diaper factories used to operate 12 hours a day when the demand boomed, but due to the export obstacles, factories have reduced operating hours by 4 hours, said Adhikari.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal exported 201.99 million pieces of sanitary pads and diapers worth Rs719 million to India in the last fiscal year, ending mid-July.Likewise, a big consignment of Goldstar shoes failed to get export clearance after India refused to issue the BIS certificate, putting Nepal’s homegrown shoemaker on the brink.Exporters said there were rumours on Friday that India had extended the deadline to obtain a BIS certificate, and the Nepali exporters were allowed to export goods with their existing certificates.“But we have not received any formal notice from the Indian authority on the time extension of the BIS certificate,” said Baburam Adhikari, spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. “If the BIS had made such a decision, we would have been informed.”“Neither the BIS India nor the domestic industries has confirmed or communicated with us on the issue.”After Nepali exports were halted over the BIS issue, the industry ministry has written multiple times to its Indian counterpart. Meetings were held, and the issue was forwarded even during Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari’s visit to India in August. “However, there is no progress,” said Adhikari. Adhikari said none of the Nepali exporters who applied for the BIS certificate have gotten it till now.“The BIS certificate issue has put the industries in Rupandehi in a big dilemma. They were opened to export goods to India,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It has negatively impacted both the industries and Nepal’s trade.Shrestha said factories are either running at half capacity or getting shut down, and workers are being laid off. Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months.“Even as the domestic consumption of cement declined, production was not impacted due to the huge demand from India. But now cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity,” said Shrestha.Except plywood, the export of all the listed goods that require a BIS certificate has come to a halt, said Shrestha. “India has neither renewed the certificate nor provided a new one.”Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geo textiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.“Plywood is currently not restricted. But despite having already paid the BIS charges and completed the process, the inspection team from India has not provided a BIS certificate for Nepali goods,” said Hom Prasad Ghimire, president of the Nepal Plywood Manufacturers Association. Ghimire said that his company completed the process of getting the BIS certificate in June. He said the Nepali plywood is of better quality than the Indian plywood.Plywood has been given until March 2025 for certification-free export. He said that out of 80 plywood factories, 52 have even deposited charges to obtain the certificate. The plywood industry employs 25,000 workers across the country.According to the association, Nepal exported Rs8 billion worth of plywood to India. The volume could have increased had the exports not been interrupted.Trade with India has been repeatedly obstructed. Experts say there is a need to seek long-term solutions for uninterrupted trade with the southern neighbour. “There must be a mutual recognition agreement on select exportable items. Under such an agreement, exportable goods certified by the government will be recognised by the Indian government. This would be the best long-term solution for standard certification,” said Posh Raj Pandey, chairman of the South Asia Watch of Economics, Environment and Trade.Under the 2009 bilateral trade agreement with Nepal, India agreed to support the setting up of standard-purpose labs, said Pandey. However, Nepal has not been able to push for the labs during talks with India— even after 15 years of the agreement. He said lack of coordination among government agencies and frequent changes of bureaucrats have put the issue on the back burner.

Donald J Trump has won the White House resoundingly, and in addition, the Republican Party, also known as the Grand Old Party, has now wrested control of the Senate and has a comfortable majority in Congress. Simply put, Trump and the GOP now have complete control of the executive and legislative branches of the government, which will embolden the new Trump administration to pursue policies with determination. The world is closely watching how the Trump administration will usher in a new foreign policy paradigm that revolves around Trump’s “America First” philosophy. Foreign policy mandarins across the globe have mixed feelings about Trump's victory: Allies in Europe are gripped with anxiety, whereas in South Asia, there is a sense that since the rhetoric of Trump’s election campaign focused on combating China, Asia is on the cusp of witnessing unprecedented American engagement. It is in this context of American outreach in Asia that South Asia will play a pivotal role in shaping outcomes of a constantly evolving new world order. Nepal must remain steadfast in keeping up with developments of the great power games whilst constantly safeguarding and pursuing its interests independently. The heart of the US’s contention with China revolves around two critical issues: Trade and technology. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated to the world how global trade supply chains depended on supply lines in China. With the resurgence of the America First policy, the Trump administration is determined to impose new trade tariffs of up to 60 percent on Chinese exports. While the supposed new tariffs are likely to come into play in the second half of 2025, there is palpable fear that new trade tariffs could bring in disruptions to global trade as costs are likely to increase in the coming days. The Trump administration is determined to create new jobs to revitalise the economy by incentivising manufacturing in the country. Whilst Trump's plan to re-establish the US as a manufacturing hub is seen as a patriotic move, could higher labour costs in a developed country contribute towards lower production costs? The US’s trade conflict with China presents other developing nations in Asia with a unique opportunity to attract investments in the manufacturing industry. Although it is outlandish to suggest China will be entirely substituted as a manufacturing hub, the emergence of new manufacturing opportunities in the global south presents the US with the opportunity to fuel economic growth essential for the sustenance of democracy. South Asia gives the US a unique avenue for enhanced collaboration. With a democratic polity spread across most of South Asia’s landmass, job creation and energy production are the key elements for stability in the region. The Indo-Gangetic delta is among the most populous regions in the world and possesses the human capital to fuel economic growth across South Asia. Although the Civilian Nuclear Deal between India and the US is a milestone agreement for the use of clean nuclear energy to generate electricity in India, the nuclear plants in India only contribute 3.11 percent of the total electricity generated in India. For India to meet the energy requirements to set up a large-scale industrial base, access to high-quality uninterrupted energy will be critical for industrialisation in India and across South Asia. The Millennium Challenge Corporation pact signed between Nepal and the US is a significant breakthrough in Nepal’s energy sector, as American investment in upgrading transmission line infrastructure is greatly required to transport high-quality, uninterrupted energy.Nepal still requires robust investment in the transmission side to feed supply lines across South Asia. The fact that Nepal, Bangladesh and India have signed a power trade agreement demonstrates the potential of Nepal’s energy sector in fuelling energy to propel economic growth in the region. South Asia missed the industrial flight back in the decades of the 80s and the 90s; it’s time the region reaped the benefits of the US capital that could trigger a wave of industrialisation. Another focal point of tension between the US and China is the issue of semiconductors. The US would want to retain the technological leadership of high-end chips in the hands of its allies, namely Taiwan, South Korea and the Netherlands. Currently, the world relies solely on Taiwan and its crown jewel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), for high-end chips—TSMC has a market share of 90 percent of advanced chip manufacturing. Both the US and China know the strategic advantage one can gain by accessing high-end chips, which is critical for next-generation AI modelling in sectors such as defence, intelligence, telecom, medicine and aerospace. The ability to store big data also depends on the quality and the advanced functioning of high-end chips. In simple words, the US’s ability to retain control and contain access to high-end chips to compete whilst diversifying the production of low-end chips will provide the US and its allies the political leverage it desperately wants. The tech industry in South Asia has been recognised as a force to reckon with, particularly in India and the periphery of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka seems to have made progress, while Nepal also aspires to expand its tech business reach. Cross-border payments, the expansion of data centres and the use of technology in the delivery of governance are areas of expansive collaboration. India’s ability to produce low-end chips in the future is also critical to expanding the tech industry in South Asia, as indigenously produced chips can help reduce manufacturing costs and the tech industry’s dependency on accessing chips elsewhere, which are always in high demand globally. But there are also areas of concern for South Asia regarding Trump’s ascendency to the White House. Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and climate change is an issue that confronts South Asia, particularly Nepal. Nepal has witnessed firsthand the impacts of climate change and, therefore, the country and South Asia at large cannot afford to ignore the impact of climate change. This issue cannot become secondary for either Nepal or the region. Climate change challenges the livelihoods of our people, and the Government of Nepal must voice its concern visibly and work towards creating strategic alliances that will compel the new US administration to rethink walking away from Paris Climate Agreement. The new US administration and its South Asian partners must work on issues impacting human welfare to achieve wider social and economic participation in the democratic process in the region. Trump’s vision of America First is virtuous, but to restore the US’s trust globally, he must take its allies into confidence.  ","summary":"The US has just concluded our generation's most eagerly watched presidential elections.

But there are also areas of concern for South Asia regarding Trump’s ascendency to the White House. Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and climate change is an issue that confronts South Asia, particularly Nepal. Nepal has witnessed firsthand the impacts of climate change and, therefore, the country and South Asia at large cannot afford to ignore the impact of climate change. This issue cannot become secondary for either Nepal or the region. Climate change challenges the livelihoods of our people, and the Government of Nepal must voice its concern visibly and work towards creating strategic alliances that will compel the new US administration to rethink walking away from Paris Climate Agreement. The new US administration and its South Asian partners must work on issues impacting human welfare to achieve wider social and economic participation in the democratic process in the region. Trump’s vision of America First is virtuous, but to restore the US’s trust globally, he must take its allies into confidence.  "},{"hash":"bcb7bd7043864daf8a848637d130c880fcbac215b6bcb0ed1320ffd9a01c115e","title":"tia-s-reduced-flight-hours-could-stall-economic-growth","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/11/08/tia-s-reduced-flight-hours-could-stall-economic-growth","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/money/Untitled1-1731029082.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1731024000000,"source":"kp","category":"money","content":"How big will the impact be as Nepal’s major international airport closes for ten hours starting Friday?Economists say it’s too early to quantify, but the losses for the Nepali economy will be huge.Nepal’s economic momentum has slowed down since the late September floods, and the government’s decision to close the key airport could stifle growth.“It will be a big setback for the country’s ailing economy as it will hit tourism and business activities, including transport, hotels, restaurants, telecommunication and other sectors,” said Bishwambhar Pyakurel, a noted economist. Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement.

When we decided to meet at Cafe Cheeno in Patandhoka following the launch of his book, ‘Human Nature’, I expected our conversation to last for an hour, but we were done within twenty minutes. Bell studied at the University of Oxford and the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. Fresh from graduation, he came to Kathmandu for the first time in 2002 as an international correspondent to cover the ongoing civil war. He ended up staying longer than he would have imagined—eighteen years. His books, ‘Kathmandu’ (2014) and ‘Human Nature’ (2024), result from his in-depth reporting, travels and research on Nepal and the Nepali people.Currently living in the UK, Bell, a former South East Asia correspondent for the UK Daily Telegraph, is more inclined towards books than journalism. In this chat with the Post’s Anish Ghimire, Bell discusses coming to Nepal, the state of contemporary journalism and his new book ‘Human Nature’.Have you always wanted to be a journalist? Not exactly. After I finished university, I began looking around, thinking about what I should do, and journalism seemed like it would combine a few things I was interested in: politics, travel, and writing. So it was a choice I made later.What made you come to Nepal during a difficult period and write ‘Kathmandu’?Well, I came here because it was a difficult period. I had recently graduated in history and wanted to be a foreign correspondent. So, I looked around, considered a few options, and chose Nepal. It felt like the right option because of what was happening in the country. Right after the royal massacre, the Maoists were making progress in the countryside, and the world was paying attention to Nepal. It seemed like a nice place to travel around as well. The country grew on me, and I ended up staying for about eighteen years.How did your time in Nepal shape your understanding of the complex relationship between the country’s history, culture and politics? I was primed to think about those relationships because of what I studied at the university. Alongside a degree in history, I also acquired another degree in architectural history. So, writing about it came naturally. Plus, I was interested in learning about the country’s culture, politics, and architecture. I dug deeper to write about how the streets, the squares, the chowks, and the buildings worked together.I have done something similar with the new book, ‘Human Nature’, but instead of built-in environments, it’s about the hills, mountains, forests, and rivers. You’ve been in journalism for a long time, having worked for the Economist and The Daily Telegraph. How has journalism changed since you arrived in Nepal for the first time? Journalism around the world has changed a lot. Today, there is a lot less money in it. When I started, Nepal was going through a difficult period, and there were plenty of stories to report. A young man like me could make a decent living abroad because newspapers paid my freelance work a modest amount.However, that is not the case anymore because of industry changes and the emergence of the internet. The media worldwide lacks resources, and people get their news by other means. Another big difference is when I first came here, a few Nepali journalists reported in English for foreign media. Now, that space is filled up by many local reporters who can do much better than an outsider. So, that’s good progress.Some of the changes in the industry brought about by the internet have also affected the domestic media landscape here. Newspapers are struggling for business. For the last few days, I have been trying to find newspapers in the market; there weren’t many shops selling them.Your new book, ‘Human Nature’, explores Nepal’s history. What aspect of the country do you believe is most misunderstood?This book looks at Nepal’s history but from a particular lens—in terms of the relationships between society, culture, and the environment. So, it’s kind of an environmental history. Something that might be new to the readers is the discussion of the role of agriculture.Prithvi Narayan Shah is celebrated as a military and political genius who rose from the micro-kingdom of Gorkha to unify Nepal. By his death in 1775, he had conquered the Kathmandu Valley and established it as his capital. He laid the foundation for the Gorkhali Empire, which briefly spanned the Himalayas from Sikkim to Punjab. His success is often attributed to his strategic brilliance and patriotic vision, portraying him as a unifier of a fragmented land. A key aspect of his strategy was rewarding soldiers with land, creating a land-military system that fueled his empire’s expansion. However, this narrative is intertwined with a more profound history: the rise of agriculture, particularly rice farming. Rice cultivation had been spreading eastward in Nepal long before King Shah’s time, fostering the growth of small kingdoms. Unlike foraging or pastoralism, rice farming produced surplus food, which brought about taxation and the establishment of villages, kings, laws, and temples. This agricultural transformation necessitated greater social and military organisation, creating the conditions for unification. King Shah and his successors finalised this process, consolidating the numerous ‘rice kingdoms’ into a single nation, completing a centuries-long evolution of agrarian society into a centralised state.How similar or different is writing a piece and writing a book?I don’t do much journalism these days. The only writing I do is for my books, which come out occasionally. But yeah, the writing process is very different. Writing a short piece is merely a thousand words, whereas a book is about eighty thousand words. The difference is like running a marathon and a sprint, I guess.

In the race are a total of 20 candidates—nine from various political parties and 11 independents.In the 2022 local elections, independent candidates presented a formidable challenge to political party candidates in various local units. Independent candidates won mayorships in the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, the Dharan Sub-Metropolitan City and the Dhangadhi Municipality. Will the outcome in Kirtipur be different this time, or will the traditional parties prevail? The by-election comes after the death of Rajkumar Nakarmi, former Mayor of Kirtipur Municipality, who died in July due to kidney failure. He had won on a Nepali Congress ticket.Major political parties including the Congress, the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) have fielded their candidates. But the fourth largest political party in the House of Representatives, the Rastriya Swatantra Party, did not field anyone reportedly after failing to find a suitable candidate.The candidates include Krishnaman Dangol from the Congress, Surendra Manandhar from the UML, and Shiva Sharan Maharjan from the Maoist Centre. Besides these, seventeen others, including 11 independents, have filed their nominations. Candidates from other parties include Dil Kumar Maharjan of the Nepal Samajbawadi Party, Shri Krishna Maharjan of the Nepal Majdoor Kishan Party, Dhurba Maharjan of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, and Keshav Shrestha of the Janamat Party. Similarly, independent candidates include Navaraj Kumar Baniya, Rajman Manav, Ram Krishna Maharjan, Mim Maharjan, Prem Bahadur Maharjan, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari, Naresh Shrestha, Dharmaratna Manandhar, Ananda Maharjan, Nareshraj Pande, and Kabir Kumar Maharjan. In the 2022 local elections, the Congress candidate Nakarmi won the mayorship with 9,043 votes, while his closest competitor, Keshav Ratna Bajracharya of the UML, secured 5,507 votes. The Maoist Centre’s Shiva Saran Maharjan, who is contesting for the position in the by-election, had obtained 4,090 votes then. Of the total 31,112 registered voters, almost 14,000 live in the core area of Kirtipur, and the remaining 17,000 reside in the peripheral regions. The core area includes the municipality’s wards 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, including Tyanglaphat, whereas the peripheral areas include wards 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The core area is predominantly inhabited by the Newar community, while the peripheral region is more diverse with migrants in big numbers. Political leaders and analysts say that the peripheral region will be decisive in the election.But Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol disputes this claiming that the concept of peripheral region is a misrepresentation. “The area that some people call ‘peripheral’ is in fact the core of Kirtipur,” Dangol told the Post. “From Nagau, Panga, Bhajungle, to Chobhar all are part of Kirtipur’s core area.”UML candidate Surendra Manandhar agrees with Dangol and says dividing the local unit along community lines is not a good idea.Dangol, the Congress candidate, considers UML’s Manandhar his close competitor, but some local residents say the true challenge could come from the Maoist Centre’s Shiva Sharan Maharjan, who had a strong showing in the 2022 local election. “Majarjan already contested and did well. The UML’s Manandhar is new, therefore we believe there will be a tough competition between the Congress and the Maoist Centre,” said a local resident.The Maoist Centre has also forged an electoral alliance with the CPN (Unified Socialist) and the Janata Samajbadi-Nepal, led by Upendra Yadav, to strengthen its bid.“I lost the previous election due to a technical mistake, but this time, we are confident of a win,” the Maoist Centre candidate Maharjan told the Post. He said his chances have improved due to the growing public disenchantment towards the current ruling Congress-UML coalition.But UML’s Manandhar appears unbothered by the competition. He said he is better prepared than others and is confident of a win.For the Congress, the contest appears more difficult as former Congress party members are running as independents. Kabir Kumar Maharjan and Dinesh Kumar Adhikari, who were previously with the Congress, are among the independent candidates.“The situation of Congress is different. For other parties, winning adds a seat, but losing doesn’t make much difference because they hadn’t won this seat in the previous election,” Himal Karki, a local Congress leader, told the Post. “But, for Congress, there’s a pressure to win because this is a seat our party earlier won.”An overwhelming presence of independent candidates makes the contest more complex for Congress, as local figures who have established their own identity in Kirtipur, such as Rajman Manav, are getting considerable voter attention.Harka Sampang, the independent mayor of Dharan Sub-metropolitan City, has also expressed his support for Manav. Sampang is set to join Manav’s election campaign starting from November 23.“Harka Sampang will be in Kirtipur for my election campaign,” Manav told the Post.Congress candidate Dangol, meanwhile, does not consider Manav as a competitor. He claimed that Manav is a former UML cadre and quit the party to focus on social activities, especially sanitation campaigns. “So Manav could draw UML votes, not ours,” Dangol said.Meanwhile, Suresh Maharjan, a Kirtipur resident who identifies himself as a Maoist Centre sympathiser, says the votes garnered by independent candidates will determine the election’s outcome.  ","summary":"Candidates for mayor in Kirtipur Municipality, where a by-election is being held on December 1, have started their election campaign.

Earlier, the court had also authorised the arrest of 24 others, including Gorkha Media chair Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, in relation to the same case.Lamichhane, Joshi and Ramtel have already been arrested and are being interrogated in Kaski and Rupandehi districts over the misuse of cooperative funds. With this, the police are now simultaneously investigating them in the three districts of Kathmandu, Kaski and Rupandehi.The trio is accused of diverting tens of millions of rupees from Kathmandu-based Swarnalaxmi Cooperative, Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Cooperative and Butwal-based Supreme Cooperative to Gorkha Media Network that operated the now-defunct Galaxy 4K Television. Rai and Lamichhane were chairman and managing director of the media company respectively.

He was 83.Dhungana, who was suffering from a chronic liver problem, was rushed to the Baneshwar-based Frontline Hospital after he experienced breathing problems on Sunday. Doctors pronounced him dead upon arrival at the hospital.Dhungana was born in January 1942 in Kathmandu.Throughout his life, Dhungana maintained a distinct identity in Nepal’s political movements. Despite being affiliated to the Nepali Congress for a long time, he didn’t confine himself within the party’s domain. He earned immense respect from other political parties and communities fighting for their rights and identity.He joined politics as a student activist from the beginning of the Panchayat period in the 1960s and later established himself as an advocate, human rights activist, civil society leader, and politician. He became general secretary of the Nepal Bar Association in 1971. Dhungana was also a founder executive member of Amnesty International. In 1990 he served as a member of the Constitution Recommendation Commission that drafted Nepal’s constitution.Dhungana spent five years in jail during different periods under the Panchayat regime for supporting political parties that were banned at the time for opposing the system. He fought against the Panchayat system and for the restoration of democracy after King Mahendra abolished the parliamentary system and imposed the partyless Panchayat system in 1960, says Congress leader Arjun Narashinga KC.“Dhungana was an intellectually towering figure who made a huge contribution to Nepali society,” former minister KC said.Those who remember Dhungana say that his legacy cannot be captured through a single lens since he had multiple identities.Raghuji Pant of the CPN-UML remembers Dhungana as a lawyer who advocated for democratic rights during the Panchayat regime. Later, Dhungana got elected as a member of parliament from Kathmandu-2 on a ticket of the Nepali Congress, which also won a majority in the 205-seat House of Representatives during the 1992 parliamentary polls, the first general election conducted after the restoration of democracy in 1990. As the only Congress candidate to be elected from Kathmandu and his background as an advocate and former general secretary of Nepal Bar Association made him an ideal choice for the role of Speaker. Dhungana thus became the first Speaker after the restoration of the democracy, and the second in overall parliamentary history of Nepal. Congress leader Krishna Parsad Bhattarai is the first Speaker in Nepal’s history as he was Speaker of the first parliament elected in 1959.“However, Dhungana was someone who set a benchmark for Speakers in Nepal and someone who could be consulted on Parliamentary affairs,” lawmaker Pant told the Post. “Despite being from the rival political party, we alway respected him.”For Pant, a phrase coined by Dhungana in the parliamentary history of Nepal is something to be cherished which is, “Parliament always belongs to the opposition party while the government is led by the ruling party.”Hari Bahadur Thapa, a senior journalist who closely followed parliamentary affairs, believed that Dhungana’s approach to give the opposition party more space in the House made him a leader respected by all.Thapa also says that there was a time when the Congress, the party that appointed him as Speaker, was unhappy with him for giving more space to the opposition.Dhungana could not complete his term as Speaker after Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala dissolved the House and announced midterm elections in 1994 due to intra-party feud within the Congress party.Dhungana wasn’t quite active as a party leader after the mid-term election of 1994. However, he played a key role as a civil society leader in the people’s movement in 2006. Dhungana also played an active role in facilitating negotiations between the government agencies and mainstream political parties with the erstwhile rebel Maoists. He was one of the key mediators while signing important agreements between mainstream political forces and Maoists. In 2017, after a 23-year gap from active party politics, Dhungana contested the parliamentary election from Bhaktapur-2 on a Congress ticket, but did not win.In an interview with The Kathmandu Post in August last year, Dhungana had said that Nepalis brought about radical political changes but didn’t learn how to run the democracy responsibly. “As successive governments have failed to deliver, those who want to undo recent political changes are emboldened,” he said in the interview. “A section of the intelligentsia also backs the idea. This is how multiple complications are emerging.”Dhungana is survived by his wife Bhuwan Koirala, two sons, and a daughter. According to family sources, he will be cremated on Monday after one of the sons Nimesh Dhungana who is in Britain returns. His other son Nishesh and daughter Nikita are in Nepal.Tributes pour inTop politicians, members of the intelligentsia and rights activists, among others, have paid tributes to Dhungana and expressed condolences to the bereaved family members.President Ramchandra Paudel said he was shocked by the news of Dhungana’s death. “The contribution made by Dhungana to the democratic movement as a politician, senior advocate and a civil society leader will always be remembered,” the Office of the President wrote on social media platform X on Sunday.Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli expressed his sadness and wrote on Facebook: “I recall his remarkable contribution to the human rights movement and promotion of parliamentary democracy in Nepal.”Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel said “Dhungana’s death caused irreparable loss to the country’s democratic movement.”Akhilesh Upadhyay, former editor-in-chief of The Kathmandu Post, remembers Dhungana as arguably Nepal's best Speaker to date.“Much respected by the opposition- UML, NWPP, Sadhavana, etc. But Nepali Congress heavyweight and then-prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala disliked him; Dhungana refused to entertain GPK's partisan interests,” Upadhyay wrote on X. “History will be kinder.

In the first phase, emissions of petrol and diesel vehicles operating in the metropolis will be randomly tested, and the city office has also planned to carry out emission testing for motorcycles.Emission testing will be carried out on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the Department of Transport Management and received green stickers. Officials say that vehicles with green stickers could still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.“We have seen many vehicles with green stickers emitting black smoke,” an official at the Environment Department of the KMC said, asking not to be named as the official is not authorised to talk to the media. “Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing.” Officials say that the amount of the fine will be determined based on the suggestions of stakeholders.Vehicle emission testing is among the measures the city office has been taking to reduce pollution levels in the metropolis.The KMC has also started independently monitoring the city's air quality, with support from the Partnership for Healthy Cities, which has provided 19 portable devices to the city office.The Partnership for Healthy Cities is a global network of 74 cities, including the Kathmandu metropolis, committed to saving lives by preventing noncommunicable diseases and injuries.

Major hospitals also report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Doctors warn that people get sick from respiratory illnesses caused by polluted air throughout the year, due to polluted air.Doctors say air pollution is known to cause various respiratory illnesses. Poor air quality can cause short- and long-term effects on public health. In the short term, it can lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems, and in the long run it can lead to severe conditions like ulcers, and cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, and heart complications.People in low- and middle-income countries get disproportionately affected by the polluted air, which accounts for more than 90 percent of deaths, according to the World Health Organisation.Several studies carried out in the past in Nepal show that toxic air takes a huge toll on public health. Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke, according to experts.The report, titled “Global burden and strength of evidence for 88 risk factors in 204 countries and 811 subnational locations, 1990–2021: A systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021,” finds that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent). The report was published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy.

The identity of Bandipur was at risk when the traders, along with the district headquarters, shifted.However, Bandipur has changed its identity due to the role of locals in cultural heritage conservation through community participation.Bikram Piya, a 55-year-old local, said that after the construction of the Prithvi Highway, if the headquarters had remained in Bandipur, people residing in the western part of Tanahun would be greatly inconvenienced in accessing government services.  “Therefore, Damauli is perfect for the district headquarters from the accessibility point of view.”Bandipur's history, a hilltop settlement 143 km west of Kathmandu and 80 km east of Pokhara, began in the 19th century when Newars from Bhaktapur arrived.Before that, it was inhabited mainly by Magars. After Prithvi Narayan Shah conquered Kathmandu Valley, the Newar merchants chose Bandipur as a trade route between India and Tibet. The merchants built their houses so as to reflect their style, architecture, and culture. Thus, the houses consist of pagoda-style roofs, lattice windows, and ornate doorways.Today, it is one of the most famous tourist destinations of Nepal. “The living culture, structure and natural beauty are the defining features of Bandipur,” said Piya.The Magars used to live in Bandipur and gave the place its name. In the Magar language, ‘Ban’ means forest, ‘Di’ means water, and ‘Pur’ means place. Civilisations have relied on forests and water since ancient times.According to old local documents, first Piya, then Pradhan, Shrestha, and Joshi settled here, and then other Newar types came.Bikram, a ninth-generation settler, says: “Bandipur is a living museum of Newari art and culture.”“Bandipur sits in the best of nature. It is also an appropriate place for business. That’s why it became a big draw for Newars from Bhaktapur,” said Chij Kumar Shrestha, an 80-year-old local. “Ancestors settled where there was water, land and jungle. Mine did the same too.”Trade was the major occupation of Newars. They supplied salt, edible oil, and other goods from Thori, Chitwan, on the Nepal-India border, and sold them in Bandipur Bazaar.Shrestha said that Bandipur developed as a trading point between the south and north. Goods imported from India used to be supplied to the hills and mountain areas like Tanahun, Kaski, Lamjung, and Gorkha, and goods brought from the hills and mountains would be supplied to the south from Bandipur.As highway expansion took place and traders started shifting to Chitwan, Kathmandu, Damauli, Pokhara, and Dumre, business activities in Bandipur started to slow down.“As young people moved away, the villages were left with old people. Even if tourists, by any chance, were found in Bandipur, they called it a ghost town,” said Sujan Shrestha, a 50-year-old local.Moved by the situation, people from Bandipur living in Kathmandu formed the Bandipur Social Development Committee in 1992. The committee's president, Sujan Shrestha, said the objective was to unite the people of Bandipur in tourism, education, and health.Sujan said Bandipur was promoted internationally because it represents different ethnicities' natural and cultural richness.“Foreign tourists started arriving, and homestays started to open,” said Sujan. “Training sessions on hospitability were provided on services ranging from tea brewing to homestay operations.” All types of vehicles started operating in Bandipur Bazaar in 1999. However, they were restricted due to the paving of market areas with stones.Bandipur is a destination preferred by those who want to escape crowds and pollution. A pleasant mountain range can be observed from the high hill of Bandipur, including the view of the rising and setting sun. A wide view of mountains is another feature of Bandipur.An open area stretches 3 km on the horizon, and hills can be observed from Tundikhel, a 10 minute walk from Bandipur.From top to bottom, mountain ranges like Langtang, Ganesh, Gorkha (Manaslu, Himchuli, and Boudha), Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Machhapuchchhre, and Kanjirowa can be observed.A natural view tower, the land area near Marsyangdi River can also be observed from Bandipur.Developed as one of the outstanding tourism destinations of Gandaki province, Bandipur is also known as the ‘Queen of Hills.’ Located at a height of 1,317 metres, Bandipur is popular for its perfect view of mountain ranges and its cultural and religious significance. “Agro-eco tourism and adventure tourism is the big draw of Bandipur,” said Kishan Pradhan, president of the Bandipur Tourism Development Committee.Tourism activity, which has slowed down due to the devastating earthquake of 2015 and the Covid-19 pandemic, is gradually reviving.“The presence of domestic and international visitors is now good,” said Pradhan.Bipin Pradhan, a hotelier, said traditional art and culture, natural views, and a clean environment are the reasons why domestic and foreign tourists come.Siddha Cave in Bandipur, a rural municipality, is claimed to be Asia’s largest.Basanta Poudel, secretary of Bandipur Tourism Development Committee, said Bandipur is also an appropriate place for hiking.“Bhanjyang and resting area located at the height of 1,150 metres from sea level, paragliding from Gurungche Hill attracts tourists,” said Basanta.Around 90 big and small hotels and restaurants are operating in Bandipur, while four community homestays in the market area and 11 in the rural municipality are in operation.The hotel and homestay services in Bandipur can cater to 5,000 people.To increase tourists' stay, a mini great wall was constructed in 2019. The 6-km wall is being constructed from Thanimai temple to Mukundeshwari hill.The construction of the mini-great wall is expected to cost around Rs20 million.“The construction of structures like this can attract tourists,” said Surendra Bahadur Thapa, chairman of the rural municipality.Construction of projects like Thanimai temple, selfie garden, paragliding area, horse riding arena, Pushpalal memorial garden, Mukundeshwari garden, and a glass bridge is moving ahead. ","summary":"When Tanahun’s headquarters shifted to Damauli from Bandipur in November 1968, hordes of traders from Bandipur left for key cities like Chitwan, Damauli, Kathmandu, and Pokhara. The identity of Bandipur was at risk when the traders, along with the district headquarters, shifted.However, Bandipur has changed its identity due to the role of locals in cultural heritage conservation through community participation.Bikram Piya, a 55-year-old local, said that after the construction of the Prithvi Highway, if the headquarters had remained in Bandipur, people residing in the western part of Tanahun would be greatly inconvenienced in accessing government services.  “Therefore, Damauli is perfect for the district headquarters from the accessibility point of view.”Bandipur's history, a hilltop settlement 143 km west of Kathmandu and 80 km east of Pokhara, began in the 19th century when Newars from Bhaktapur arrived.Before that, it was inhabited mainly by Magars. After Prithvi Narayan Shah conquered Kathmandu Valley, the Newar merchants chose Bandipur as a trade route between India and Tibet. The merchants built their houses so as to reflect their style, architecture, and culture. Thus, the houses consist of pagoda-style roofs, lattice windows, and ornate doorways.Today, it is one of the most famous tourist destinations of Nepal. “The living culture, structure and natural beauty are the defining features of Bandipur,” said Piya.The Magars used to live in Bandipur and gave the place its name. In the Magar language, ‘Ban’ means forest, ‘Di’ means water, and ‘Pur’ means place. Civilisations have relied on forests and water since ancient times.According to old local documents, first Piya, then Pradhan, Shrestha, and Joshi settled here, and then other Newar types came.Bikram, a ninth-generation settler, says: “Bandipur is a living museum of Newari art and culture.”“Bandipur sits in the best of nature. It is also an appropriate place for business. That’s why it became a big draw for Newars from Bhaktapur,” said Chij Kumar Shrestha, an 80-year-old local. “Ancestors settled where there was water, land and jungle. Mine did the same too.”Trade was the major occupation of Newars. They supplied salt, edible oil, and other goods from Thori, Chitwan, on the Nepal-India border, and sold them in Bandipur Bazaar.Shrestha said that Bandipur developed as a trading point between the south and north.

The festive demand increased the consumption of dairy products which also helped in clearing arrears of farmers,” said Prahlad Dahal, president of the Nepal Dairy Association.Earlier, the private dairies asked the government for loans by putting butter and powder milk stocks as collateral, but the government did not respond.The association had said that the private dairies had around Rs2 billion dues to be paid to the farmers a month and a half ago.According to the association, the private sector has 2,000 tonnes of unsold butter in stock. The sale of dairy products improved in the festive season sales but the off-season of dairy products has started, the private dairy entrepreneurs said.“We normally convert liquid milk into powder milk during March-April when the sales decline,” said Dahal.The association said that 3.2 million litres of milk arrives in the market daily, of which around 25 percent is held by the DDC and the remaining is purchased by private dairies.The daily milk purchases of the private dairies amount to around Rs100 million.“Out of the around Rs6 billion in arrears, both the government-owned DDC and private dairies have cleared around Rs3 billion till now,” said Amar Bahadur Kunwar, president of the Central Dairy Cooperative Association.

What alarms doctors and experts is that the problem is not limited to patients with serious ailments but it also affects those seeking outpatient care.The irrational use of antimicrobials in humans, animals, and plants has led to a ‘silent pandemic’, and many people, including policymakers, have not taken the issue seriously.“Misuse, random use, and irrational use of antimicrobials, which can be purchased over-the-counter, has been leading to a serious crisis in our country,” said Dr Raju Pangeni, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Hams Hospital. “Most patients arrive at the hospital after using higher-grade antibiotics.”Experts warn that antimicrobials, which have saved millions of lives throughout the world, could soon become ineffective due to the high resistance rate caused by their irrational use.The World Health Organisation said antimicrobial resistance occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites evolve over time and no longer respond to medicines, making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness, and death. As a result, medicines become ineffective and infections persist in the body, increasing the risk of their spread to others.Antibiotics, despite being prescription drugs, can be easily purchased over the counter in Nepal. Many people buy them without explaining their exact problems to pharmacists. And in many cases, pharmacists do not bother to inquire and fail to emphasise the importance of completing the prescribed course of medicine, which is among the main reasons for the growing rate of antimicrobial resistance, according to experts.Moreover, doctors usually prescribe antibiotics based on clinical diagnoses, even before receiving laboratory test reports. Experts say antibiotics do not work if the underlying infection is caused by a virus. According to experts, a patient’s sensitivity to antibiotics must be known before prescribing them, but very few doctors take the time to understand their patients' sensitivity to the drugs they prescribe. Patients are also unaware that the course of antibiotics must be completed and stopping them halfway could render the same antibiotic ineffective in the future. According to a 2021 study of the Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC), only 32 percent of the doctors and health workers have access to laboratories for antibiotic susceptibility testing. Among them, only 49 percent recommend antibiotic susceptibility testing before prescribing antibiotics. This means that only 16 percent of doctors recommend antibiotics after conducting susceptibility testing.“There is a significant reason influencing rational prescriptions of antibiotics,” the report stated. The study also shows that more than one-third—37.8 percent—of prescribed medicines were antibiotics, which is higher than the World Health Organisation’s standards.The study shows about one-fourth (22 percent) of the outpatients did not consume a full course of antibiotics. Similarly, about 10 percent of outpatients consume antibiotics as prophylaxis while eight percent take double-dose antibiotics for a quick recovery. Around 22 percent of them save leftover antibiotics for the treatment of similar symptoms in the future. Additionally, around 28 percent of outpatients said they buy antibiotics without doctors’ or health workers’ prescriptions. While human antibiotic use contributes to antibiotic resistance, the widespread use of antibiotics in agricultural applications—most notably livestock and poultry production—is also a potential driver. Doctors say agricultural antibiotics contribute to the presence of resistant bacteria in meat and poultry products. Also, resistant organisms are released from farms into soil, groundwater, and surface waterways, leading to contamination of water sources used for crop irrigation and domestic purposes.The NHRC study showed around 70 percent of farmers used progressively higher doses of antibiotics and more frequently for faster recovery of sick animals or fowls. The study identified major shortcomings in the awareness and availability of national guidelines for prescribing antibiotics and infrastructures for recommending antibiotic susceptibility tests among human and animal health professionals. In a study of human, animal, and environmental samples carried out in the past, antimicrobial resistance genes were detected in 81 percent of the total samples on which antimicrobial resistance tests were carried out.

In addition to free delivery services, the programme provides mothers and babies with free medical treatment, a transportation allowance, and cash incentives for antenatal checkups.Women in the mountainous, hilly and Tarai districts receive Rs3,000, Rs2,000 and Rs1,000, respectively. Additionally, a cash bonus of Rs800 is provided to mothers who complete all eight antenatal checkups. The institutional delivery rate, which was around 18 percent before 2009, when the government declared free institutional delivery services, has increased to 80 percent.“We have been collecting bills from hospitals providing safe motherhood services,” said Joshi. “As it is a national priority programme, we cannot discontinue the services. We will send invoices to the Health Ministry for reimbursement.”Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 239 per 100,000 births in 2016 to 151 per 100,000 in 2021, according to the national census carried out by the National Statistics Office.Earlier, the country had cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award.The health target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030.Fatality due to poor access to medical services during childbirth remains a leading cause of women’s death in Nepal.Data provided by the division show that at least 50 women from 51 districts succumbed due to complications during childbirth since the start of the current fiscal year. Division’s data show that at least 190 women from 51 districts died from complications during childbirth in the fiscal year 2023-024. In the fiscal year 2022-023, 191 maternal deaths were recorded across 49 districts. Health officials concede that the actual number of maternal deaths due to birth-related complications could be much higher, as maternal and perinatal death surveillance is being carried out in only 51 districts of 77 districts.According to the latest census report, 622 maternal deaths were recorded in a year. Officials at the health ministry concede that the deaths reported from 51 districts represent only around 30 percent of the total maternal deaths across the country.Lack of maternal and perinatal death surveillance programmes in all districts is the main reason for the underreporting of maternal deaths, and the budget shortfall is to blame for the inability to carry out maternal and perinatal death surveillance, officials say.Maternal and perinatal death surveillance is a key intervention to improve maternal, perinatal, and neonatal survival rates. Experts say such surveillance provides an understanding of the number and causes of deaths, enabling more targeted and effective interventions.The World Health Organisation said maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response (MPDSR) is an essential quality improvement intervention, which permits the identification, notification, quantification and determination of causes and avoidability of maternal and neonatal deaths and stillbirth to orient the measures necessary for their prevention.According to the UN health body, systematic analyses of overall mortality trends and events and contributing factors leading to individual deaths can identify barriers in health systems and inspire local solutions to prevent such deaths in the future.Every year, over 600,000 women deliver babies in Nepal.

We will send invoices to the Health Ministry for reimbursement.”Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 239 per 100,000 births in 2016 to 151 per 100,000 in 2021, according to the national census carried out by the National Statistics Office.Earlier, the country had cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award.The health target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030.Fatality due to poor access to medical services during childbirth remains a leading cause of women’s death in Nepal.Data provided by the division show that at least 50 women from 51 districts succumbed due to complications during childbirth since the start of the current fiscal year. Division’s data show that at least 190 women from 51 districts died from complications during childbirth in the fiscal year 2023-024. In the fiscal year 2022-023, 191 maternal deaths were recorded across 49 districts. Health officials concede that the actual number of maternal deaths due to birth-related complications could be much higher, as maternal and perinatal death surveillance is being carried out in only 51 districts of 77 districts.According to the latest census report, 622 maternal deaths were recorded in a year. Officials at the health ministry concede that the deaths reported from 51 districts represent only around 30 percent of the total maternal deaths across the country.Lack of maternal and perinatal death surveillance programmes in all districts is the main reason for the underreporting of maternal deaths, and the budget shortfall is to blame for the inability to carry out maternal and perinatal death surveillance, officials say.Maternal and perinatal death surveillance is a key intervention to improve maternal, perinatal, and neonatal survival rates. Experts say such surveillance provides an understanding of the number and causes of deaths, enabling more targeted and effective interventions.The World Health Organisation said maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response (MPDSR) is an essential quality improvement intervention, which permits the identification, notification, quantification and determination of causes and avoidability of maternal and neonatal deaths and stillbirth to orient the measures necessary for their prevention.According to the UN health body, systematic analyses of overall mortality trends and events and contributing factors leading to individual deaths can identify barriers in health systems and inspire local solutions to prevent such deaths in the future.Every year, over 600,000 women deliver babies in Nepal.

But even in the capital, many people suffer from health problems linked to deficiencies of crucial micronutrients, including vitamin B12,” said Ambika Paudel, manager at the Sales and Distribution Department of the company.Malnutrition is considered a silent health crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five, which fell from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.Paudel informed that the company has blended iron, zinc, vitamin A, Vitamin B12, B1, B2, B6, and folic acid into rice, the country's staple food. Though only iron, zinc, vitamin A, folic acid, and vitamin B12 are mandatory, the company has been blending additional micronutrients, such as vitamins B1, B2, and B6 as well. Consumers have to pay an additional Rs5 per kilo for the fortified rice, which is blended in Kathmandu, Surkhet, Janakpur and Jajarkot.Officials say they have been selling blended rice at market price in all five districts of Karnali Province. Fortified rice is available in 25kg sacks at the company’s outlets.“We received a grant to sell micronutrient blended rice at market price in the districts of Karnali Province,” said Paudel. “We hope this initiative will help address malnutrition there.”Malnutrition plays a major role in the under-five mortality rate, according to the nutrition section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. Experts say malnutrition also hinders children’s mental development, and eventually affects the country’s economic health by weakening intellectual capacity, reducing productivity in adulthood, and increasing vulnerability to diseases.Although the 2022 survey showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces.More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province suffer from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or underweight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.Likewise, around 10 percent of children under the age of five years in Madhesh Province have been found suffering from wasting.Nepal also has an international obligation to improve the condition of malnourished children.The country needs to reduce stunting to 15 percent from the existing 32 percent by 2030 in order to meet the SDG targets, wasting to four percent from the current eight percent, underweight condition to 10 percent from the existing 19, and anaemia to 10 percent from more than 43 percent at present.“Various measures are being taken to address the improvement of the nutrition status,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Micronutrient fortification in rice is one among several measures being taken to tackle the existing malnutrition problem.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC.

Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. ","summary":"We spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley "},{"hash":"c077b34beda2250a997231f215f178053a057340c5c72de0aec15b25ae40ddb7","title":"old-memories-and-new-realities-in-phidim","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/travel/2023/11/18/old-memories-and-new-realities-in-phidim","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2023/third-party/phidim%20main%20(1).JPG&w=900&height=601","date":1700265600000,"source":"kp","category":"travel","content":"Once again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation.

The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” ","summary":"Chaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52.

She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. ","summary":"In 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

Khan has been imprisoned for a year on several cases, including the attack on a military installation, corruption and the Al Qadir Trust case. Initially, the party leaders and its members of Parliament were set to participate in the protest; now, it has been extended to the entire nation. The PTI is apprehensive that its leaders may not join the rally as they might come under pressure. Therefore, general participation by sympathisers would keep the party’s popularity in good standing. Despite challenges and roadblocks, the party has always worked on show of strength; however, the May 9 incidents of violence and attack on the army installation, including a Corp Commander’s house, are a reminder of how such confrontation may go out of control.The PTI has put forward three demands to call off the rally. First, reversal of the ‘stolen mandate’. The PTI thinks that in the last election, the party would have won but was denied due to the ‘mechanisation’ of the establishment, which allowed the Pakistan Muslim League (N) to form a new government. However, this narrative is not new. The party spoke about this when the last election voted the PML (N) into power.

However, he fell from grace due to his confrontationist attitude with the powerful military. He blamed General Qamar Javed Bajwa, former Army Chief, for the no-confidence motion in the Parliament that forced him to resign in 2022 and, later, his election defeat in the February 2023 election. This was despite Bajwa being granted a three-year extension by the Khan government.His attempt to promote Lieutenant General Faiz Hameed as the next Army Chief did not succeed. Gen. Hameed has been arrested and is facing court-martial on charges of corruption and abuse of power. Khan’s removal of Gen. Asim Munir, the current Chief of Army Staff, as Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence was considered a political blunder. Yet, this was the first time the Pakistan Army was divided over their support for Khan, showing how he could create a political space for himself within the army as their best bet.The army blames Imran Khan for the May 9, 2023, attacks, which severely blew the image of Pakistan’s military as an invincible player in domestic politics. The army holds Khan responsible for the inflammatory speech that motivated his supporters to attack. The military strengthened its position after the Shehbaz Sharif government passed an amendment to the Pakistan Army Act, 1952, extending the tenure of the heads of the armed forces to five years. This would mean that Khan’s troubled relationship with the current Army Chief will not end soon. Parliamentarians from the PTI tore the bill in the National Assembly as a symbolic protest. Imran’s offer of dialogue with the government to resolve the problem notwithstanding, both for Sharif’s government and the PTI, the rally is a show of strength. This call for protest may rejuvenate the cadres and prove Khan’s political strength; however, the government will take all steps for its failure.Imran Khan and populismKhan has used his popularity for populist politics, evident through street power asking for fresh elections even after losing the election. He flags the ‘injustice’ he has suffered with false cases to motivate their workers to hold rallies. Despite attempts by the military, the leaders have remained united, fought the last election as independent candidates and desisted allurement to leave the PTI.Yet Khan feels that some Parliamentarians may not join the PTI workers on the street. He has underlined that those elected on party ticket must be in Islamabad to support the PTI leadership. Meanwhile, the government has imposed Section 144 to foil the rally.

His supporters also believe that their leader is being politically victimised through the judiciary, where several corruption cases have been decided against him. Top party leaders are also in jail. So, who will lead the party and motivate the supporters to break the curfew and join the Islamabad rally? His wife, Bushra Bibi, is facing several corruption cases, and his sister, Aleema Khan, has been making statements for the past few weeks asking his supporters to march to Islamabad.

Sadly, South Asians are not in a position to respond locally, nationally or regionally because beyond a few scientists, we are not cognisant of the term ‘Anthropocene’, and there is no cross-border cooperation as we approach the ecological abyss.South Asia should be leading the climate emergency debate at the COP29 conference, happening now in Baku, but our positioning is weak and scattered even though the moment is existential.Film South Asia ’24As the organisers of the biennial Film South Asia festival of documentaries whittled down more than 2,000 submissions to less than 50 for screening (November 21-24), we noted that many films addressed the dangerously skewed nature-human interface. ‘Documentary in Anthropocene’ was selected as the festival theme.Documentary filmmakers are the ‘canaries in the mine’, with a vocation to inspect, understand and raise alarm. They are on to something that the mainstream media, social media and cinema have mostly neglected: That the world is approaching an ecological tipping point. And who is to say what social, psychosocial, political, economic and cultural dislocations are already playing out all around, amidst our politics and geopolitics as usual?In mountain regions, species are moving up the slopes, as warming gases are pumped into the atmosphere.

In low-lying Bangladesh, distributaries cut into villages, destroying lives and livelihoods (Whispers by the River Shore). Human efforts are no match for the fury of avenging nature in the form of Cyclone Remal (Topsy Turvy), nor can the once plentiful sea provide livelihood to fisherfolk (Against the Tide).The Anthropocene must become part of mainstream discourse, enough for it to be politically charged. Hence, ‘Anthropocene’ must be wrested from English and penetrate the societal epidermis by seeing debate in tea shops and dhabas. Rather than try to seek root words in Sanskrit, Arabic or Persian, ‘Anthropocene’ should serve the purpose.Global Real TimeThe documentaries at FSA ’24 remind us that there is no escape from 4.5 billion-year-old Earth, with the epochs, eons and eras of its existence divided into geological time. The Holocene epoch began with the end of the last ice age around 12,000 years ago, but it was with the Industrial Revolution that the biosphere came under frontal attack of humans, added the Great Acceleration after the 1950s. With the Global South copying the North’s economic models and consumption patterns, there is no stopping this race from Anthropocene to Armageddon.The cumulative impact of humans is evolving like the asteroid which banged into the Yucatan 66 million years ago, killing off 75 percent of species, from dinosaurs to ammonites. The scientific community has refused to include the Anthropocene formally in the Geologic Time Scale, but the Anthropocene is very much part of Global Real Time.The term is an appropriate descriptor of the ongoing havoc foisted on nature, incorporating much more than global warming and climate change. We are pushing the biosphere beyond repair as we allow plastics to rule over us, embank rivers, deplete groundwater, force the poor into mass migration, destroy habitat, warm the tundra, mine the sand, add acidity to the oceans and push species to extinction.Humans changing the environment is an old story, we have a name for it now. Not so long ago, the One-Horned Rhinoceros lived all the way from the Brahmaputra to the Kabul River. The spread of humans eastward shrank the ‘Great Jangal’ of the Indus-Ganga plain, and today, the western-most habitat of the rhino is a small strip of doon in Nepal’s Inner-Tarai.Those building ‘water management infrastructure’ refused to consider natural silt carried by our rivers, the unique monsoon, cloudbursts and glacial lake outburst floods. Our leaders fell victim to gigantism, and at the very start, in 1954, the Kosi Barrage was inaugurated. ‘Bihar’s Sorrow’ was jacketed between dykes for a hundred kilometres, and in seven decades since, the settling silt has lifted the Kosi’s bed many metres above the outlying plain. A decisive break in the embankment will devastate eastern Bihar, the result of misapplied engineering.The spread of canals in the upper Ganga supported the Green Revolution, but it brought moisture to the land surface in winter-time, generating extended periods of ground fog (seet lahar) that keeps tens of millions freezing over weeks on end. Meanwhile, for all the press publicity, India and Pakistan will not sit together to address the smog that smothers the population from Lahore to Delhi.If you really want to know, the advent of kite-flying was against nature’s system, though seen as the most innocent of pleasures. It was and remains a shock to birdlife which had ruled the skies since they evolved, until confronted midflight with the thread that maims and kills (All that Breathes). Southasian brown cloudAll of a sudden the famous winter fog of Kathmandu has become history, as the Valley transforms into wall-to-wall concrete. In the Valley skies, parakeets screech about whereas they were a feature of lower climes. High on Mount Everest, Sherpa climbers report gurgling water where there was once only hard ice. Climate change seems to be loosening the permafrost of the Himalaya, and all across 2,500 km chain, billions of tons of debris locked into ice may be about to release their grip.The South Asian brown cloud (or ‘black carbon’) emitted in Punjab, Punjab and Haryana (straw burning, vehicular and coal plant emissions, road and construction dust) casts a pall all the way to Chittagong. When the coating of dark dust settles on snow and ice, the sun’s radiation is absorbed rather than reflected, and we have accelerated snowmelt, glaciers retreat.In 2023, this Indus-Ganga smog crossed the delta, curled over the Bay of Bengal and reached Sri Lanka and the Maldives. How can there be a tourism industry in Shimla, Pokhara or Darjeeling if you cannot see the Himalaya, or when there is no snow on the himals? Beyond aesthetics and tourism, this loss of snow and ice cover means depleted groundwater to feed the Ganga, ultimately impacting hundreds of millions all the way to the delta.Haze diplomacyForced migration has been a constant theme of documentary films, and we are about to face the Great Migration linked to related Anthropocene phenomena—one, the rising ocean which will not only submerge the atolls but also displace tens of millions along the entire South Asian shoreline; two, the scorching heat above 50 degrees Celsius in the Indus-Ganga plain which will push people to the highlands.South Asia must be alert to the Anthropocene, our discussion must descend from scientific confabulations and COP events to the peoples’ level. For starters, Nepal needs to begin ‘haze diplomacy’. For the sake of all living beings of the subcontinent from the ocean to the mountain, Kathmandu must demand that New Delhi and Islamabad collaborate to end the South Asian brown cloud.Nepal, with its geography (steepest cross-sectional incline) and demography (diverse communities living on the gradient), is the barometer of climate change and the Anthropocene. To shake others up, we must wake up ourselves.

Meanwhile, for all the press publicity, India and Pakistan will not sit together to address the smog that smothers the population from Lahore to Delhi.If you really want to know, the advent of kite-flying was against nature’s system, though seen as the most innocent of pleasures. It was and remains a shock to birdlife which had ruled the skies since they evolved, until confronted midflight with the thread that maims and kills (All that Breathes). Southasian brown cloudAll of a sudden the famous winter fog of Kathmandu has become history, as the Valley transforms into wall-to-wall concrete. In the Valley skies, parakeets screech about whereas they were a feature of lower climes. High on Mount Everest, Sherpa climbers report gurgling water where there was once only hard ice. Climate change seems to be loosening the permafrost of the Himalaya, and all across 2,500 km chain, billions of tons of debris locked into ice may be about to release their grip.The South Asian brown cloud (or ‘black carbon’) emitted in Punjab, Punjab and Haryana (straw burning, vehicular and coal plant emissions, road and construction dust) casts a pall all the way to Chittagong. When the coating of dark dust settles on snow and ice, the sun’s radiation is absorbed rather than reflected, and we have accelerated snowmelt, glaciers retreat.In 2023, this Indus-Ganga smog crossed the delta, curled over the Bay of Bengal and reached Sri Lanka and the Maldives. How can there be a tourism industry in Shimla, Pokhara or Darjeeling if you cannot see the Himalaya, or when there is no snow on the himals? Beyond aesthetics and tourism, this loss of snow and ice cover means depleted groundwater to feed the Ganga, ultimately impacting hundreds of millions all the way to the delta.Haze diplomacyForced migration has been a constant theme of documentary films, and we are about to face the Great Migration linked to related Anthropocene phenomena—one, the rising ocean which will not only submerge the atolls but also displace tens of millions along the entire South Asian shoreline; two, the scorching heat above 50 degrees Celsius in the Indus-Ganga plain which will push people to the highlands.South Asia must be alert to the Anthropocene, our discussion must descend from scientific confabulations and COP events to the peoples’ level. For starters, Nepal needs to begin ‘haze diplomacy’. For the sake of all living beings of the subcontinent from the ocean to the mountain, Kathmandu must demand that New Delhi and Islamabad collaborate to end the South Asian brown cloud.Nepal, with its geography (steepest cross-sectional incline) and demography (diverse communities living on the gradient), is the barometer of climate change and the Anthropocene. To shake others up, we must wake up ourselves.

Smog shrouds the skies, obscuring the hills and mountains surrounding Kathmandu Valley. While this is concerning, visuals of air pollution in the neighbouring countries have alarmed the world. Last week, images of the nearly invisible Taj Mahal and India Gate went viral. Further, the smog in parts of Pakistan and northern India was so dense that it was visible from space. According to the WHO, air with AQI values above 300 is labelled hazardous. It is only a matter of time before Kathmandu Valley and other parts of Nepal face a fate similar to India’s New Delhi and Pakistan’s Lahore, where AQI values have surpassed 1,000.Nepal is the third most polluted country in the world, according to a 2024 report by Air Quality Life Index (AQLI). Particulate pollution is the leading threat to human health in Nepal measured in life expectancy, reducing it by 3.4 years. By comparison, tobacco use cuts life expectancy by 1.9 years, while dietary risks and high blood pressure reduce it by 1.5 years each. What’s more, Nepal’s 30.7 million people live in areas where the annual average particulate pollution level exceeds the WHO guideline. Pretty much the same story repeats every year. On Thursday, Lalitpur’s air quality index reached 238 at 12:45 pm, getting closer to hazardous levels. Experts warned that air quality would go downhill in the coming days as farmers both in India and Pakistan clear fields after the autumn harvest. According to a recent report by Reuters, the burning of stubble left after harvesting rice has contributed to 40 percent of the pollution in Delhi. Such a dangerous practice in the Indo-Gangetic plains is bound to affect Nepal. We cannot solely blame our neighbours when we also indulge in harmful practices. A previous study shows that around three million tonnes of agricultural residue are burnt in the Tarai region. Besides these, emissions from vehicles, brick kilns, and open burning are among the country’s significant sources of pollution. If consumed for long, these pollutants are detrimental to our health. According to a 2024 report by the State of Global Air (SOGA), 75 percent of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 39 percent of lung cancer deaths were attributed to air pollution. Even as our leaders inhale the same toxic air, their response to tackling air pollution has been woefully inadequate. While actions like banning open burning and monitoring brick kiln emissions have been introduced, they are limited to some local units. Even if vehicles pass emission testing from the Department of Transport Management and get green stickers, they still emit black smoke, as many only service them before the annual pollution tests. In response, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has purchased a smoke metre to test emissions from such automobiles.Although these actions are commendable, the federal government must do more. Exhaust from public vehicles is a major problem. Even as nearly 12,000 battery-powered vehicles were imported last year, these were primarily private ones. The government should open avenues for people to switch to eco-friendly ways of cooking and travelling. If we act seriously to reduce particulate pollution to WHO guidelines, countless lives could be saved. Additionally, residents of Tarai and Kathmandu could gain 4.8 and 2.6 years of life expectancy, respectively. While tackling domestic sources of air pollution is essential, it is as important to acknowledge its transboundary nature. Only a coordinated, collective, multinational effort can help clean up the air we breathe.  ","summary":"A drop in temperature has brought with it a sharp decline in air quality.

Nonetheless, the country has been unable to realise even a fraction of its potential due to limited market access and an unfavourable political climate. As a result, currently, the country generates just around 3,000 megawatts. The recent power trade with Bangladesh through India’s grid, however, could mark a turning point. Under the deal, yearly, 40 MW of electricity will be exported to Bangladesh for five years, from June 15 to November 15. This follows a tripartite agreement between the NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam, the Nepal Electricity Authority and the Bangladesh Power Development Board on October 3, 2024. The export, initially envisioned in 2018, was finally inaugurated on Friday. The agreement offers several advantages to all the countries and stakeholders involved. First, it strengthens regional cooperation and boosts economic development of these countries. Second, it promotes green energy in Bangladesh by reducing its reliance on fossil fuels. A 2022-23 government report of Bangladesh reveals that the country relies mostly on natural gas to meet its energy demand, and hydroelectricity accounts for only 1 percent of the total energy generation—24,911 MW. Nepal will also greatly benefit from this trade as it offers a chance to cut its trade deficit, which stands at Rs1.44 trillion; the agreement is expected to generate Rs330 million annually. Further, as Nepal will transmit the energy to India through the 400KV Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur cross-border transmission line, the southern neighbour can also benefit from it.This agreement highlights the positive outcomes of nations working together for shared goals. It remains to be seen how sustainable it is though. Efforts should be made to facilitate uninterrupted electricity transmission, as international market access is crucial, especially for Nepal. While India’s willingness to facilitate power exports to Bangladesh is welcome, Nepal’s sole dependency on its southern neighbour for energy trade also cannot be denied. Without direct territorial links, Nepal’s ability to independently access foreign markets remains constrained. To overcome this, establishing a South Asian energy grid would be a game changer, enabling energy exchanges and opening avenues to harness the vast hydroelectric potential of the Himalayan region. Gaining India’s confidence and support for initiatives that enhance sub-regional productivity is vital in this regard. India therein also has a great opportunity to show that it is indeed a true leader of South Asia. As crucial as the agreement may seem, this agreement has only set a precedent. Nepal plans to produce 28,500 megawatts by 2035, so it must address a range of technical and regulatory hurdles to ensure both smooth production and cross-border transmission. Equally important is developing infrastructure to maximise the country’s electricity production. Again, concerted efforts from all South Asian countries can help the region increase its renewable energy generation and also boost sub-regional connectivity. The success of the Nepal-Bangladesh electricity export agreement offers a promising starting point for the realisation of these goals. What happens next will depend on the will of the Nepali political class to continuously follow the path of national prosperity.    ","summary":"Nepal exports 40 MW of electricity to Bangladesh, highlighting the benefits of regional cooperation, green energy, and economic development, while underscoring Nepal's need for improved infrastructure and a South Asian energy grid."},{"hash":"4761456446e1ef256b58ec29fa5cc6045c1c8f6012aa49ea8c0a0539a5924cf2","title":"**Reasons to Visit China:**\n\n* **Rich History and Culture:** China has a long and fascinating history, with ancient temples, palaces, and the Great Wall of China.\n* **Diverse Landscapes:** From bustling cities to stunning natural wonders like mountains, lakes, and deserts.\n* **Incredible Food:** Chinese cuisine is renowned worldwide for its variety, flavors, and ingredients.\n* **Friendly People:** The Chinese people are generally welcoming and hospitable.\n* **Affordable Travel:** China offers good value for money, with many affordable attractions, accommodation, and transportation options.","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/11/17/why-go-to-china","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/thumb37-1731851818.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1731801600000,"source":"kp","category":"editorial","content":"Prime Minister Oli visited China before India after waiting for an invitation from India.

With advancements in technology, populist leaders can communicate directly with their base, making them less inclined to engage with intermediate institutions.\n\n**Populism and Social Media**\n\nSocial media has played a role in the rise of populism by enabling the spread of fake news and doubt about traditional authorities. However, it is not solely responsible for the phenomenon. Populist leaders also engage in traditional campaign methods to reach voters.\n\n**India's Foreign Policy**\n\nUnder Prime Minister Modi, India has maintained a consistent foreign policy objective of maximizing development space while maintaining good relations with key global powers. However, there has been a shift from prioritizing relations with neighboring countries to focusing on global engagement.\n\n**India-China Relations**\n\nChina has become a concern for India in South Asia, but some politicians overplay its influence. India's approach to China is based on global power dynamics, and it remains committed to engaging with China for economic benefits.\n\n**India-US Relations**\n\nIndia's relations with the US have improved under Trump. Trump's pro-India team has signaled support, but there may be friction on trade and climate issues.\n\n**India's Balancing Act**\n\nIndia maintains strong ties with both the US and China, as it needs both countries for its technological and economic development.

and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies.
