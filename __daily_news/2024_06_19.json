The German government provided notable support to Nepal after the 2015 earthquake and during the COVID-19 pandemic as well.\"\nNepal and Germany established diplomatic relations on April 4, 1958. Since then, the ties between the two countries have progressed based on friendship, mutual understanding and cooperation.\nSpokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Amrit Bahadur Rai said that the visits taking place at various levels between the two countries would assist in further deepening the mutual relations.\n\"We are confident that this visit at the Head of State level will contribute in bringing the German investment and technology into Nepal. Germany has made a good deal of study and practices on adaptation to safeguard from the effects of climate change, and there are many things that Nepal can learn from this as well,\" he said.\n"},{"hash":"701788c79d699c1965c5d6a2826825ba39ee3cc5a17ad0da572314d4f0540171","title":"president-paudel-in-germany","date":1718778648206,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/global/president-paudel-in-germany","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/17c496fa_df53_4c33_9ff6_8dc721990f491718496771_1024.jpeg","category":"global","content":"\nÂ After visiting Switzerland, President Ramchandra Paudel arrived in the capital Berlin on Saturday night for a visit to Germany.

The team started at 2 AM (approx.) from Camp IV, and after a continuous effort of over 17 hours, they made it to the topâ â Mingma Sherpa, Chairman of SST added. This remarkable achievement was the result of a meticulously planned expedition that started in March and commenced in the first week of May from Lukla.\nDespite being summited for the first time in 1954 by Dr. Herbert Tichy, Sepp Joechler, and Pasang Dawa Sherpa, the standard climbing route lies in Tibet. Cho Oyu's Nepal side is known for its steep, vertical walls rising thousands of meters, making it one of the greatest present time challenges. The face of the mountain from the Nepal side had not witnessed a successful climb since 2009 (by Denis Urubko and Boris Dedeshko â Route: South Face), despite numerous attempts, highlighting the difficulty involved.\nThe expedition faced numerous challenges along the way.

The team started at 2 AM (approx.) from Camp IV, and after a continuous effort of over 17 hours, they made it to the topâ â Mingma Sherpa, Chairman of SST added. This remarkable achievement was the result of a meticulously planned expedition that started in March and commenced in the first week of May from Lukla.\nDespite being summited for the first time in 1954 by Dr. Herbert Tichy, Sepp Joechler, and Pasang Dawa Sherpa, the standard climbing route lies in Tibet. Cho Oyu's Nepal side is known for its steep, vertical walls rising thousands of meters, making it one of the greatest present time challenges. The face of the mountain from the Nepal side had not witnessed a successful climb since 2009 (by Denis Urubko and Boris Dedeshko â Route: South Face), despite numerous attempts, highlighting the difficulty involved.\nThe expedition faced numerous challenges along the way.

The governmentâs 10 percent tax hike on electric vehicles (EVs) for the fiscal year 2024-25 comes as a tight slap to the countryâs commitment to EV-based mobility by 2030âat a time green transport systems across the country feel ever more important. For this or that reason, consumers here are obliged to line up for a whole day, if not days, to fill up their motor tanks. In a recent case, the underpaid fuel station workers halted fuel supply to private dealers and thronged the state-run stations in Kathmandu. These occurrences are here to stay, reminding us of the need to take the EV transition seriously. It is widely known that promoting EVs offers multiple benefits. The transition to electric vehicles in Nepal will not only reduce vehicular emissions and clean the air but also discourage the countryâs overreliance on fossil fuels, which account for more than 17 percent of the total import bill. This shift, in turn, can help us leverage our under-tapped hydropower potential to build charging stations and export electricity to the two closest neighbours transitioning to green policies. EVs are costly to install, and concerns about insufficient charging stations in Nepal remain, but they are still more efficient and cost-effective than petrol or diesel vehicles. Nepal will also benefit from increased climate funds in the long run if we successfully make air breathable by cutting vehicular emissions through EV adoption. After all, Nepal must have a moral ground and track record of actions to negotiate for these funds and canât always fall back on the excuse of the countryâs negligible contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. What policymakers seem to be overlooking is the urgency of EV adoption. Their plans and policies on electric vehicles are ambiguous as, on the one hand, they pledge a green energy future while, on the other, they agree on building oil pipeline projects with India. Moreover, they always set ambitious goals and fail to achieve them. For instance, by introducing the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) in 2016, the government aimed to increase the share of EVs to 20 percent of all passenger vehicles; however, by 2020, only 1 percent were electric. Now, when people are more interested in buying these green wheels due to the tax cut on EVs last year, the new tax increment is bound to affect their choices. These developments are setbacks to meeting net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 and decarbonising the transport sector by 2030.Itâs high time to come up with clear policies on green growth and execute interventions that wholeheartedly support electric vehicles. This includes installing charging stations and finding ways to sustain them by emulating international practices on repurposing, recycling and managing used batteries. Many organisations, donor agencies and development partners are extending their hand to Nepal in this effort. Failing to establish clear strategies and imposing tax restrictions could mean missing out on the benefits these agencies can provide and the overall change electric vehicles can bring to Nepal. The green energy goal is worth pursuing collectively, as no less than the future of humanity depends on it. Nepal as a responsible global actor must do its bit.Â  "},{"hash":"00c0be1f34b2e9e4ee9218110d661704736d7c1438a58debf7e6019bbda87c99","title":"challenges-of-being-on-the-indian-periphery","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/06/18/challenges-of-being-on-the-indian-periphery","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/LeadShutterstock2-1718727369.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1718668800000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"The Poet Laureate of the 1950s, Laxmi Prasad Devkota (1909-1959), penned a lyrical essay, âKe Nepal Sano Chha?â (Is Nepal small?), and claimed that Bharatmatako Mutu (The heart of mother Bharat) was âpretty, quiet and greatâ.

Every country, irrespective of its size, has the right to adore itself if it doesnât degenerate into collective narcissism. But itâs dangerous to fantasise that someone else will help end its misery or to hallucinate that all others are conspiring to harm its interests. The anxiety that Narendra Modiâs electoral enthronement as a third-term prime minister of the most populous country in the world has caused everywhere is real. A beacon of hope for the freshly freed countries since the 1950s, India was often cited as an exemplar of slow but steady path from exploitative governance to social justice through democratic processes. By re-electing âone of the worst autocratisersâ for the third time, albeit with a lower margin, a significant section of Indian voters has shown that it values religious gratification of Hindutva chauvinism much more than its democratic credentials. Nepal was once âthe only Hindu Kingdomâ of the world, and itâs perhaps understandable that remnants of the ancien rÃ©gime of the Shah and Rana clan look towards the entrenched Hindutva establishment in New Delhi with a poignant sense of longing and hope. The sadness comes from the realisation that the Hindutva lobby in India doesnât care much about what happens to the conservative elements in Kathmandu. Hope rekindles whenever a minor functionary of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) makes a promissory statement to support the restoration of âHindu Rashtraâ in Nepal. However, the wishful expectations of Hindutva factions in the Rashtriya Prajatantra Party and the Nepali Congress stand on shaky grounds: Indian foreign policy is dictated by its geostrategic compulsions, geoeconomic considerations and geopolitical options. Cultural diplomacy is merely a tool at the hands of its adroit practitioners. Fears of former Naxals, such as the de facto supremo of the ruling alliance Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli or the degenerate Maoists of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahalâs ilk, appear to be equally unfounded. National interests invariably triumph over ideological considerations in the implementation of foreign policy. The priorities of Modi 3.0 towards Nepal are unlikely to be much different from what they have been since 2015âquiet behind-the-scenes manoeuvres combined with studied indifference in public.Strategic irrelevanceThe Gandhian dreams of self-rule, self-sufficiency, social justice, non-domination and ethical rightness fired the Indian Independence Movement. The Nehruvian pursuit of modernity in political economy laid the foundations of a country emerging from some of the worst excesses of British colonialism. The Ambedkarite idea of India as âa social democracy firmly established on the principles of liberty, equality, fraternity, and humanityâ remained an aspiration till the aughties. Meanwhile, revivalists of âHindu gloryâ had a completely different idea of India since the early 1920s.The leadership of the Sangh Parivar wanted to replace all secular ambitions with the Savarkarite concept of Hindutva hegemony in a civilisational state of, for, and by the people who had their homeland, motherland, fatherland, and holy land within the Akhand Bharat. When Premier Modi assumed office in 2014, he took care to cloak the Hindutva agenda with economic rhetoric. He managed to dupe some people for almost a decade with an enticing slogan of inclusive development. Back in the saddle with the cobbled majority of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and forced to rely on temperamental partners in the coalition, he has once again begun to repeat his beguiling bombasts of the past.On the domestic front, Premier Modi may be forced to dilute his hardline Hindutva to maintain the cohesion within the NDA. However, the continuation of his team for external affairs shows that Indian foreign policy will stay its course. S. Jaishankarâs suave toughness has been retained by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). Speaking at the First Gateway of India Dialogue in 2016 as the top bureaucrat of MEA, Jaishankar closed his speech with a statement of purpose: âA new normal is in the making, one where the business of Indian diplomacy is increasingly business.â Jaishankar will continue to be tasked with procuring petroleum products from Russia, industrial goods from China, advancing military hardware from countries of the West, and managing the contradictions of being simultaneously in the Chinese-dominated BRICS and the US-led Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. The sophisticated but blunt former bureaucrat shall be the face of Modi 3.0 in the international arena. A scholar, Jaishankar, can elucidate about India being ânon-Westernâ and ânot anti-Westernâ, ignoring the distinction without an inherent difference in the proposition. Multipolarity is an oxymoron, and multi-alignment is just a jargon in the bipolar world of the Cold War II. Despite its geoeconomic handshake with the Russians, the geostrategic foot of Indian diplomacy finds Western grounds firmer and friendlier than its Chinese challengers.Perhaps the former spymaster Ajit Doval will have a more prominent role in geostrategic affairs as the third-time National Security Advisor. He has been elevated to the rank of a Cabinet Minister and put on par with the former secretary of the MEA. When National Security Advisor of the United States Jake Sullivan came to New Delhi on June 17, 2024, he did meet Jaishankar. Still, he held âcomprehensive discussion on a broad range of issuesâ with his counterpart. If Nepal figured at all in their conversations, it probably was connected with countering the Chinese influence in South Asia.Tactical impassivityFrom the legions of the imperial epoch through the armada of the colonial era to the cyber security challenges of the AI age, economic considerations have always remained the main concern of all competing powers. Tall talks of tourism and hydropower notwithstanding, Nepal is essentially a resource-poor country with the export of unskilled and semi-skilled youths to the labour markets of the world as its primary source of income. There is a reason the four pillars of Premier Modiâs economic teamâAmbani, Adani, Tata and Jindalâarenât too keen on investing in the land of Pashupatinath.Competency in science and technology is important in determining the strategic significance of relatively smaller countries. Nepalâs last indigenous innovation was the watermill. Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are unlikely to prefer Banepa over Bengaluru in setting up their data management facilities.Nepal can no longer count upon the remaining Bharatmatako Mutu with Premier Modiâs Agnipath scheme on stream, and recruitment of Nepali Gurkhas in suspension. The four-time prime minister of Britain, William Ewart Gladstone (1809â1898), described the first principle of his foreign policy: Good government at home. Nepal must discard its obsession with the paranoid âyam between bouldersâ formulation and aim to be a confident pipal tree growing out of the crevices of the mighty rocks.

The Ambedkarite idea of India as âa social democracy firmly established on the principles of liberty, equality, fraternity, and humanityâ remained an aspiration till the aughties. Meanwhile, revivalists of âHindu gloryâ had a completely different idea of India since the early 1920s.The leadership of the Sangh Parivar wanted to replace all secular ambitions with the Savarkarite concept of Hindutva hegemony in a civilisational state of, for, and by the people who had their homeland, motherland, fatherland, and holy land within the Akhand Bharat. When Premier Modi assumed office in 2014, he took care to cloak the Hindutva agenda with economic rhetoric. He managed to dupe some people for almost a decade with an enticing slogan of inclusive development. Back in the saddle with the cobbled majority of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and forced to rely on temperamental partners in the coalition, he has once again begun to repeat his beguiling bombasts of the past.On the domestic front, Premier Modi may be forced to dilute his hardline Hindutva to maintain the cohesion within the NDA. However, the continuation of his team for external affairs shows that Indian foreign policy will stay its course. S. Jaishankarâs suave toughness has been retained by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). Speaking at the First Gateway of India Dialogue in 2016 as the top bureaucrat of MEA, Jaishankar closed his speech with a statement of purpose: âA new normal is in the making, one where the business of Indian diplomacy is increasingly business.â Jaishankar will continue to be tasked with procuring petroleum products from Russia, industrial goods from China, advancing military hardware from countries of the West, and managing the contradictions of being simultaneously in the Chinese-dominated BRICS and the US-led Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. The sophisticated but blunt former bureaucrat shall be the face of Modi 3.0 in the international arena. A scholar, Jaishankar, can elucidate about India being ânon-Westernâ and ânot anti-Westernâ, ignoring the distinction without an inherent difference in the proposition. Multipolarity is an oxymoron, and multi-alignment is just a jargon in the bipolar world of the Cold War II. Despite its geoeconomic handshake with the Russians, the geostrategic foot of Indian diplomacy finds Western grounds firmer and friendlier than its Chinese challengers.Perhaps the former spymaster Ajit Doval will have a more prominent role in geostrategic affairs as the third-time National Security Advisor. He has been elevated to the rank of a Cabinet Minister and put on par with the former secretary of the MEA. When National Security Advisor of the United States Jake Sullivan came to New Delhi on June 17, 2024, he did meet Jaishankar. Still, he held âcomprehensive discussion on a broad range of issuesâ with his counterpart. If Nepal figured at all in their conversations, it probably was connected with countering the Chinese influence in South Asia.Tactical impassivityFrom the legions of the imperial epoch through the armada of the colonial era to the cyber security challenges of the AI age, economic considerations have always remained the main concern of all competing powers. Tall talks of tourism and hydropower notwithstanding, Nepal is essentially a resource-poor country with the export of unskilled and semi-skilled youths to the labour markets of the world as its primary source of income. There is a reason the four pillars of Premier Modiâs economic teamâAmbani, Adani, Tata and Jindalâarenât too keen on investing in the land of Pashupatinath.Competency in science and technology is important in determining the strategic significance of relatively smaller countries. Nepalâs last indigenous innovation was the watermill. Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are unlikely to prefer Banepa over Bengaluru in setting up their data management facilities.Nepal can no longer count upon the remaining Bharatmatako Mutu with Premier Modiâs Agnipath scheme on stream, and recruitment of Nepali Gurkhas in suspension. The four-time prime minister of Britain, William Ewart Gladstone (1809â1898), described the first principle of his foreign policy: Good government at home. Nepal must discard its obsession with the paranoid âyam between bouldersâ formulation and aim to be a confident pipal tree growing out of the crevices of the mighty rocks.

There were around seven women in a small room. She rocked nervously and reiterated that she did not want to talk. We told her she did not have to. An hour later, we could not stop her from telling her story.Rimaâs body was like a battleground in itself. It was 2001: Peace talks between the government and the then rebels had just failed. Nepal Army officials came to Rimaâs house and arrested her. She was kept in captivity and repeatedly raped for 14 months by army personnel. She was only 14 at the time. She told her story in minute detail: How her limbs swelled up after being tied up, how the sounds of boots made her heart thump and how the men stomped on her breasts with those boots. She was stoic in her storytelling. Everyone almost forgot to breathe. But what upsets Rima now is not only her past. Like many other women in the world who were sexually abused in conflict, Rima faced social ostracism once the war ended, and twisted versions of social morality and patriarchy won once again. Rima tried to live with dignity. Rimaâs quiet storytelling broke into loud sobs when she started talking about her children. Her inability to give them a decent life broke her resolve. Her strength in times of great vulnerability is what breaks my heart. This meeting was in 2021, when we were still in the uncertain stages of shooting our film, Devi. I was with Devi Khadka, our protagonist, a survivor of sexual violence in Nepalâs decade-long conflict. At the time, Devi was still quite unsure about what she could do with other victims like herself, but she wanted to investigate. We had followed her journey and found ourselves in a room of forgotten women: Girls and women who had been sexually abused and raped during Nepalâs conflict. But their existence, while cursorily accepted by the state, had been effectively erased from Nepalâs history.Devi Khadkaâs story had haunted me for years. Iâd read about her in the newspapers, shocked at some of the commentary, unable to grasp the callousness of it. Khadka was arrested, tortured and raped in custody by Nepal Police personnel in 1997. She was made to tell her story to the press by the Maoist Party after she was released in 1998. A well-known âfeministâ columnist wrote a piece in the Nepali Patra weekly in defence of the police, questioning the veracity of the then seventeen-year-old traumatised girl.It took years for Devi to trust the press, and I am humbled that she trusted me to tell her story. It took four more years of telling me her story, listening back to versions of her own story, and analysing it that helped her sharpen her vision. The very act of telling one's story can give the storyteller agency. When Devi first talked to me, she was a district leader of the Maoist party, haunted by the loss of her brother, Rit Bahadur, during the conflict. Like an automaton, she fulfilled the role of a Maoist cadre, telling herself that the party was as loyal to her as she was to the party. But as she met more victims, the change in her was palpable. For those who have not seen this change, itâs easy to dismiss Devi Khadka on so many grounds: Devi can barely understand English, the language of the world of development. She has had only one day of formal education, after all. But she can, in her mother tongue, give an eloquent expression of how wartime sexual violence survivors in Nepal can be addressed. She is doing her undergraduate studies, totally self-taught, and she pours through legal documents and policy papers, catching details that escape many. She can stand on stage, tell her story and move people to action. And she can be sharp. When someone asked her if she can handle budgets as a non-English speaker, she calmly replied, âIâve managed ministries. Of course I can handle it. If you are asking if I can handle your language, I can always get hired help.â Yet, some from Nepalâs transitional justice community have been unforgiving of Devi, calling her âpoliticalâ and disingenuous. However, this is hardly a time for pettiness.My job as a filmmaker has allowed me to examine Devi. Iâve seen the trauma that wartime rape has left her with and the struggle she still undergoes to overcome the demons left behind by it. But it is the story of many Rimas, raped by the state forces or violated by the Maoists, and forsaken by both, that has shaken Devi to the core. Once committed, sheâs been steadfast. With very little support, she has built a network of survivors, lobbied with the government and other development actors, worked with human rights activists, and has added to the work of many others who have fought for justice to make a tangible impact on Nepalâs transitional justice process. The amended Transitional Justice bill, currently in Parliament, has, for the first time, included wartime sexual violence survivors and opened ways for them to get reparations and justice. Perhaps a better way to understand Devi today is as a human rights activist with political acumen. Storytelling is an act of resistance. It was for Devi but for me as wellâa way of expressing solidarity to all the women who have suffered sexual violence during the war (and in peacetime). For every year that Nepalâs transitional justice process remains incomplete, women like Rima will keep suffering while perpetrators remain free. The wounds of the likes of Rima have not healed. For now, Nepalâs wartime rape survivors have some hope with this bill. Devi Khadka, with other survivors, will push on. With the other players in the field who are schooled in the language and the world of development, welcoming Devi as an equal playerânot a victim any more, but a leaderâwill strengthen the cause.Shrestha is a filmmaker and a journalist.

Corruption cases have been filed against chief administrative officers of scores of municipalities in the past one year.

Last week, the group fired the largest volleys of rockets and drones of the hostilities so far at Israeli military sites, after an Israeli strike killed the most senior commander yet.Katz said in an X post that in the wake of threats by Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the groupâs head, to damage Haifaâs ports that are operated by Chinese and Indian companies, \"we are getting very close to the moment of deciding on changing the rules of the game against Hezbollah and Lebanonâ.âIn an all-out war, Hezbollah will be destroyed and Lebanon will be severely beaten,â he added.Israelâs military later said âoperational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated, and decisions were taken on the continuation of increasing the readiness of troops in the fieldâ.Israel, Katz said, would pay a heavy price but the country was united and it must restore security to the residents of the north.Hezbollah says it will not halt its attacks unless there is a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.A Pentagon spokesperson said the United States did not want to see a wider regional war in the Middle East.Hochstein, special envoy to US President Joe Biden, said he had been dispatched to Lebanon immediately following a brief trip to Israel because the situation was âseriousâ.âWe have seen an escalation over the last few weeks. And what President Biden wants to do is avoid a further escalation to a greater war,â Hochstein said on Tuesday.He had met the head of Lebanonâs army earlier on Tuesday and spoke to reporters following a meeting with parliament speaker Nabih Berri, who heads the armed Amal movement, which is allied to Hezbollah and has also fired rockets on Israel.The US and France are engaged in diplomatic efforts to secure a negotiated end to the hostilities along Lebanonâs border.HAIFA FOOTAGEMeanwhile, Hezbollah published a 9-minute 31 second video of what it said was footage gathered from its surveillance aircraft of locations in Israel, including the city of Haifaâs sea and air ports.

Tens of thousands of people have fled both sides of the border.Hochstein urged Hamas to accept a US-backed proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, which he said âalso provides an opportunity to end the conflict across the Blue Lineâ, a reference to a demarcation line between Lebanon and Israel where parts of the international border are disputed.Hochstein met caretaker Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, who told him that âLebanon does not seek escalationâ, according to comments issued by Mikatiâs office.The increase in attacks last week was followed by a brief respite during the Eid al-Adha Muslim holiday, which concludes on Tuesday. Hezbollah announced a drone attack against an Israeli tank on Tuesday afternoon - its first announced attack since Saturday. An Israeli spokesperson said Israel on Tuesday targeted a Hezbollah air unit.The group used more of its extensive arsenal against Israel last week, prompting United Nations officials in Lebanon to warn over the weekend that the âdanger of miscalculation leading to a sudden and wider conflict is very realâ.

Nepal endured a violent Maoist insurgency from 1996, which ended after ten years with a comprehensive peace accord in 2006.Bhandari addressed the council as a representative of the Global Alliance of the Missing, advocating for families of missing and disappeared people across the world.âThe world has not done enough to acknowledge the suffering of the families or to address their needs,â he said. âFamilies in Nepal are still waiting for answers 18 years after the end of the conflict.â This is the second time that an insurgency victim was allowed to speak before the UN Security Council, considered one of the most influential UN bodies. He said the families would like to remind states that they seek their continued support in mobilising the relevant authorities to find the âpolitical willâ and the needed resources so that families can find truth, answers, and justice. There is no sustainable peace without individual peace, he asserted. âWe, families of missing people, would like to encourage states to adopt missing persons legislation and appropriate legal frameworks in all countries where missing persons are present,â he further said. Talking to the Post over the phone from New York, he said that addressing the UN Security Council was a great opportunity to remind the leadership from different countries, including Nepal, about the situation of conflict victims and these statesâ obligation towards them. âImagine surviving the horrors of a war, only for your father, mother, siblings or children to go missing. What happens to those who remain when a family member is lost, not to death or relocation but to an enforced disappearance or having gone missing? How do the people left behind cope with that tragedy and move on,â he said.Bhandariâs father, Tej Bahadur, a former teacher, was arrested from Besisahar, headquarters of Lamjung district, on December 31, 2001, during the state of emergency. He was detained by a joint team of security forces commanded by then Deputy Superintendent of Police Pitambar Adhikari, according to the complaint filed at the disappearance commission. Tej Bahadur was blindfolded, handcuffed, and tortured in the street before being taken into custody, and was never seen again. Like Bhandari, thousands of families of the victims of enforced disappearances and other human rights violations have continuously been fighting for justice for around two decades, but successive governments and political parties have paid little attention to justice delivery. Records at the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons show as many as 3,223 complaints of enforced disappearances implicating either security forces or the Maoists have been lodged at the commission. The commission has identified 2,494 cases falling under its jurisdiction for investigation. Similarly, 63,718 complaints have been registered with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Human rights defenders say a conflict victim demanding justice from the UN Security Council is a significant step. âBhandariâs address will definitely build pressure to move the transitional justice process forward. His statement has been officially recorded,â Mohna Ansari, a former member of the National Human Rights Commission, told the Post. âIt might not have immediate results, but Nepal might face questions at the UN forums like the Universal Periodic Review.âNepalâs transitional justice process has been paralysed since July 2022, when the government decided to extend the terms of two commissions without retaining their chairpersons and members. Despite the governmentâs claim that the amendment bill to the Transitional Justice Act would be endorsed by October 2022, which would also open the door for recruiting new office bearers, there has been no progress in amending the Act.The major political parties, despite making several attempts, have been unable to find a meeting point on the bill though there has been some progress.After year-long discussions, the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives has narrowed down the differences in the bill. However, the House panel had been struggling to decide whether to categorise arbitrary killings or all killings except those that occurred in clashes as serious violations of human rights. It had also been unable to decide what happens in case the victims of human rights violations refuse to reconcile and demand punishment for the perpetrators. The Pushpa Kamal Dahal administration, through the national budget presented on May 28, has decided to set up a one-billion-rupee peace fund to provide relief and compensation to the victims. The government also has also announced to expedite the transitional justice process in the upcoming fiscal year. However, the bill has not been discussed since the formation of the UML-Maoist coalition on March 4. It is not known when the parliamentary committee will start discussing the amendment bill. Om Prakash Mishra, former Supreme Court chief justice, leads the committee formed to recommend the names of the office bearers of two commissions, but without the Act being amended, it has not commenced its work.Also addressing the UN Security Council, Lok Bahadur Thapa, Nepalâs permanent resident to the UN, said the country is committed to delivering justice to the victims by adopting its own homegrown and nationally-led process. âWe have two transitional commissions to investigate the complaints. Similarly, the parliament is working on the amendment to the transitional justice law as directed by the Supreme Court,â he said.

Tej Bahadur was blindfolded, handcuffed, and tortured in the street before being taken into custody, and was never seen again. Like Bhandari, thousands of families of the victims of enforced disappearances and other human rights violations have continuously been fighting for justice for around two decades, but successive governments and political parties have paid little attention to justice delivery. Records at the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons show as many as 3,223 complaints of enforced disappearances implicating either security forces or the Maoists have been lodged at the commission. The commission has identified 2,494 cases falling under its jurisdiction for investigation. Similarly, 63,718 complaints have been registered with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Human rights defenders say a conflict victim demanding justice from the UN Security Council is a significant step. âBhandariâs address will definitely build pressure to move the transitional justice process forward. His statement has been officially recorded,â Mohna Ansari, a former member of the National Human Rights Commission, told the Post. âIt might not have immediate results, but Nepal might face questions at the UN forums like the Universal Periodic Review.âNepalâs transitional justice process has been paralysed since July 2022, when the government decided to extend the terms of two commissions without retaining their chairpersons and members. Despite the governmentâs claim that the amendment bill to the Transitional Justice Act would be endorsed by October 2022, which would also open the door for recruiting new office bearers, there has been no progress in amending the Act.The major political parties, despite making several attempts, have been unable to find a meeting point on the bill though there has been some progress.After year-long discussions, the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives has narrowed down the differences in the bill. However, the House panel had been struggling to decide whether to categorise arbitrary killings or all killings except those that occurred in clashes as serious violations of human rights. It had also been unable to decide what happens in case the victims of human rights violations refuse to reconcile and demand punishment for the perpetrators. The Pushpa Kamal Dahal administration, through the national budget presented on May 28, has decided to set up a one-billion-rupee peace fund to provide relief and compensation to the victims. The government also has also announced to expedite the transitional justice process in the upcoming fiscal year. However, the bill has not been discussed since the formation of the UML-Maoist coalition on March 4. It is not known when the parliamentary committee will start discussing the amendment bill. Om Prakash Mishra, former Supreme Court chief justice, leads the committee formed to recommend the names of the office bearers of two commissions, but without the Act being amended, it has not commenced its work.Also addressing the UN Security Council, Lok Bahadur Thapa, Nepalâs permanent resident to the UN, said the country is committed to delivering justice to the victims by adopting its own homegrown and nationally-led process. âWe have two transitional commissions to investigate the complaints. Similarly, the parliament is working on the amendment to the transitional justice law as directed by the Supreme Court,â he said.

A 2007 Human Rights Watch report on the âuntouchablesâ of India observed, âThe only parallel to the practice of untouchability was apartheid in South Africa.â The HRW has declared caste discrimination a form of âhidden apartheidââan apt observation for Nepal as well.In the past years, caste hatred and exclusion have become more concealed yet pervasive in the Himalayan region; caste has also spread its tentacles in the global diaspora. Last month, Amnesty International criticised the governmentâs utter apathy and lack of accountability on the persistent plight of Dalits. The communist-populist alliance in government doesnât seem to heed the call for change. This is clear from recently announced government policies, programmes and budgets for the fiscal year 2024-25. The authorities are bent on keeping caste hierarchy and untouchability sacred and solid. Budget for âDalit skillsâOn March 21, 2022, attending a Dalit function in Kathmandu, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal declared that he was making a big announcement for the dignity and freedom of the âuntouchablesâ. So much so that, he said, they would not forget it in over a century. He hasnât made his supposedly phenomenal Dalit project explicit, but some Dalits still havenât given up their hopes. Something came with this yearâs budget for the Dalit community: Rs200 million to enhance Dalitsâ traditional skills to create employment and promote their livelihood. This small yet seemingly significant budget has buoyed some Dalits. After all, as everybody says, something is better than nothing. However, Iâm sceptical about the effectiveness of the Dalit-centred budget. Is it a big enough pot of money to significantly impact the target population? Most people would say âNoâ. Even some prominent Dalit NGO personalities close to the governing parties have expressed their dissatisfaction with the amount. Equally, are Dalits the only beneficiaries of this new scheme? I don't think so. The details of the intended 200-million project havenât been developed yet. But it seems many non-Dalits will also get the support, especially those close to the ruling parties and leaders. There are at least two reasons for my understanding. First is the very name of the entity the government plans to establish to use that money: A separate body called the âDalit, Neglected and Oppressed Class Upliftment and Development Corporation.â The use of so many words is likely intended to involve the beneficiaries from different castes and social groups. My suspicion stems from the second fact: In todayâs Nepal, traditional Dalit skillsâsuch as goldsmithing, tailoring, woodworking, and shoemakingâare no longer exclusively practised by Dalits. Once commercialised, many castes including the apex groups, have started these trades. So, skill enhancement projects will probably not be offered only to Dalits. I am not suggesting Dalits should have exclusive rights over these essential skills. It is neither practical nor proper to make such a case. My point is that it is probably wrong to think that the budget is for the betterment of Dalits. Untouched untouchabilityI have a serious objection to the utter lack of sensitivity towards the problems of Dalits, mainly the persistent practice of untouchability (hidden apartheid) in government policies, programmes and the budget. There is no single statement in the policies that mentions untouchability, let alone try to address it. The same applies to the state and local authorities under the federal system. The biggest irony is found in the Karnali Province, where the Province Head, Tilak Pariyar, is a Dalit man with a long history of fighting against the state as part of the Maoist movement, with ending caste oppression as a primary goal. On May 23, he presented 84-point policies and programmes of the province. Study it in detail, and aside from lip service here and there, there is no serious concern about the situation of Dalits in Karnali who have been facing caste humiliation and violence like nowhere else in the country. Yet the authorities seem totally blind to the realities! Recommended policy objectives What should a responsible government do, both in Kathmandu and Karnali? First, the federal capital should become sensitive towards the plight of Dalits, who suffer tremendously due to popular beliefs and practices of ritual impurity. Then, the federal capital should design a national policy framework that could be followed by the lower authorities.On a Sunday press meet, Caste Watch Network (CWN), a newly launched Dalit campaign group, recommended two fundamental policy objectives for tackling the complex problem of untouchability.First, the state should introduce new laws and policiesâsticks and carrotsâto enforce the constitutional and legal provisions against untouchability. It could, for example, forge a policy of immediately suspending government officials guilty of excluding and humiliating Dalits. Elderly people who discriminate against Dalits could be deprived of their elderly pensions for two years or so. Any temple practising Dalit exclusion could be deprived of state support in the form of money and sacred offerings and sacrificial animals (yes, even the historical and famous temples like Gorakhkali and Manakamana do practise a form of social exclusion). The second important policy objective would be to reform the religion. Some people frown at my suggestions about initiating religious and cultural reform, which they think takes many decades, if not centuries.While we cannot easily rewrite casteist texts like Manusmriti and Parasaramriti, it is possible to achieve the reformation of some religious beliefs and practices over time. For that, the secular state should stand firm against religious dogma and formulate proper laws and implement them. If no religious and/or cultural reform were possible at all, we would still be burning our mothers and sisters and other women alive on the sati pyres. If reform werenât possible, we wouldnât see a section of Bahuns drinking alcohol and consuming pork, and, as alluded to earlier, engaging in tailoring, drumming, shoemaking and goldsmithing. Upper castes have deceived Dalits. They have forced religious and cultural transformations in areas that benefit them materially and in other ways. And they have been opposed to the reform of those areas of religious and cultural traditions that would ensure equal rights for Dalits. For example, a Bahun doesnât become polluted by drinking and drumming; these transgressions do not anger his deities. But he thinks he and his family, lineage and other deities and spirits become polluted if a drummer enters his house. Religious-cultural reform is not as tough as it seems. Governments and authorities at all levels should introduce new laws and policies and spend large sums to change the spiritual, religious and cultural spheres. Without this, we cannot do away with untouchability. ","summary":"Nepal is a de facto caste-apartheid state.

Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will fly to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in, and the two prime ministers will hold a meeting after the ceremony, according to government officials. A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime ministerâs visit to India. It will be a two-day trip, says Rekha Sharma, Minister for Communication and Information Technology. On Wednesday, Modi phoned Prime Minister Dahal and they briefly discussed the upcoming meeting, according to government officials.Modi is set to become the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to serve three constitutive terms. The third term will be different from his first two as he was the prime minister backed by an absolute majority for his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, in the last two terms. This time, Modi has to rely on coalition partners under the banner of the National Democratic Alliance.With Modi entering his third term, will Nepal-India ties change, or will they remain the same? Modi has championed the âNeighborhood Firstâ policy in his dealings with South Asian nations. Modi is the only Indian prime minister who has visited Nepal more than onceâin 2014 and 2018, and again in 2022. Thus, he knows all top leaders of Nepal and is fully aware of bilateral issues, having served in the office for a decade.âIndiaâs policy towards Nepal will not change.

The JDU has called for a review of Indiaâs controversial Agnipath scheme, under which hundreds of Nepali youths used to be recruited into the Indian Armyâs Gorkha regiments. The Nepal government has refused to allow India to recruit its youth under this short-term scheme, arguing that the 1947 agreement between Nepal, India and Britain stipulated full-term service in both the Indian and British Armies, not short-term enlistment.âPrime Minister Modi had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Nepal,â said an Indian government statement on Thursday.

Even Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah has joined the chorus accusing Oli, who is also the UML chairman, of illegally swapping tea estate land, citing it as a clear case of policy corruption.The criticism from different quarters has put the UML on the defensive. And Oli is unable to hide his annoyance as questions come from all directions. His party is now defending the decision saying that the land swap was based on an amendment to the Land Act effected through a unanimous decision of the federal parliament.âNo party opposed the Actâs amendment. The Nepali Congress also did not register any revision to the [amendment] bill. All the parties jointly passed the law,â said Yogesh Bhattarai, claiming it was wrong to accuse Oli and his party on the matter. He went on to say that the parties that helped revise that Act were now pointing fingers at the UML as the revision had been made without their notice.Against his claim, the Nepali Congress had registered amendments to the bill. Some of its lawmakers like Radheshyam Adhikari had criticised it strongly in the Upper House. However, it wasn't objected to by the Congress while endorsing it.Experts say this is an example of how laws are passed in Nepal. The executive includes provisions that allow for policy corruption, and these are endorsed as lawmakers do not care to engage in a thorough study and deliberations over the bill.âPolicy corruption at the executive level can be checked if the lawmakers are vigilant and lawmaking is transparent,â Khimlal Devkota, a former National Assembly member who has closely studied Nepalâs law-making process, told the Post.Policy decisions in Nepal have become rather controversial. Cabinet decisions are deemed to be among such decisions. Even though the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority Act-1991 is silent on what constitutes a policy decision, the Supreme Court in 1996 sought to define it.As per the 1996 verdict issued by then-chief justice Surendra Prasad Singh and justices Keshav Prasad Upadhyaya, Laxman Prasad Aryal, Kedar Nath Upadhyay and Udayaraj Upadhyaya, decisions taken âcollectivelyâ by the Cabinet to fulfil promises made in the election manifesto constitute âpolicy decisionsâ.Nepali politicians have long been spared from prosecution as decisions made in the Cabinet are termed policy decisions. The anti-graft body has directed the government and Parliament to define what constitutes a âpolicy decisionâ. Anti-corruption activists have also been seeking clarity on the concept for the same reason.The Oli government presented a bill to amend the Land Act in 2019. It was endorsed by both houses of the federal parliament in January 2020. Based on the new law, the Oli government on April 26, 2021 allowed the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate owners to swap 343.19 bighas (1 bigha equals 6,773 square metres) of land occupied by the tea estate. The decision was challenged in the Supreme Court. A constitutional bench of the court revoked the decision ruling it illegal.The opposition started lashing out at Oli and his party after the court verdict and its full text. This was not the first time that Parliament passed the bill unanimously and realised later that the executive had mala fide intent. On December 24, 2018, the government registered a bill in the federal parliament to amend a few laws. It included a proposal to revise the Nepal Trust Act. The bill revising 56 different laws was tabled for deliberations in the House of Representatives on January 1, 2019 and it was endorsed on February 15 unopposed. The National Assembly endorsed it on March 2 that year, before President Bidya Devi Bhandari authenticated it the very next day. However, the issue came to light only when the Oli government decided to lease out the land under the trust to the Yeti Group.

","summary":"On February 7, the Supreme Court overturned the decision of the erstwhile KP Sharma Oli government to allow the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate to swap land exceeding its legal ownership ceiling with plots in any other place within the Koshi Province.With the Supreme Court issuing its full text of the verdict on May 11, opposition party leaders have started questioning the CPN-UML about âpolicy corruptionâ committed in the process.The Nepali Congress leaders have demanded a probe into the Oli governmentâs decision. Even Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah has joined the chorus accusing Oli, who is also the UML chairman, of illegally swapping tea estate land, citing it as a clear case of policy corruption.The criticism from different quarters has put the UML on the defensive. And Oli is unable to hide his annoyance as questions come from all directions. His party is now defending the decision saying that the land swap was based on an amendment to the Land Act effected through a unanimous decision of the federal parliament.âNo party opposed the Actâs amendment. The Nepali Congress also did not register any revision to the [amendment] bill. All the parties jointly passed the law,â said Yogesh Bhattarai, claiming it was wrong to accuse Oli and his party on the matter. He went on to say that the parties that helped revise that Act were now pointing fingers at the UML as the revision had been made without their notice.Against his claim, the Nepali Congress had registered amendments to the bill. Some of its lawmakers like Radheshyam Adhikari had criticised it strongly in the Upper House. However, it wasn't objected to by the Congress while endorsing it.Experts say this is an example of how laws are passed in Nepal. The executive includes provisions that allow for policy corruption, and these are endorsed as lawmakers do not care to engage in a thorough study and deliberations over the bill.âPolicy corruption at the executive level can be checked if the lawmakers are vigilant and lawmaking is transparent,â Khimlal Devkota, a former National Assembly member who has closely studied Nepalâs law-making process, told the Post.Policy decisions in Nepal have become rather controversial. Cabinet decisions are deemed to be among such decisions. Even though the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority Act-1991 is silent on what constitutes a policy decision, the Supreme Court in 1996 sought to define it.As per the 1996 verdict issued by then-chief justice Surendra Prasad Singh and justices Keshav Prasad Upadhyaya, Laxman Prasad Aryal, Kedar Nath Upadhyay and Udayaraj Upadhyaya, decisions taken âcollectivelyâ by the Cabinet to fulfil promises made in the election manifesto constitute âpolicy decisionsâ.Nepali politicians have long been spared from prosecution as decisions made in the Cabinet are termed policy decisions. The anti-graft body has directed the government and Parliament to define what constitutes a âpolicy decisionâ. Anti-corruption activists have also been seeking clarity on the concept for the same reason.The Oli government presented a bill to amend the Land Act in 2019. It was endorsed by both houses of the federal parliament in January 2020. Based on the new law, the Oli government on April 26, 2021 allowed the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate owners to swap 343.19 bighas (1 bigha equals 6,773 square metres) of land occupied by the tea estate. The decision was challenged in the Supreme Court. A constitutional bench of the court revoked the decision ruling it illegal.The opposition started lashing out at Oli and his party after the court verdict and its full text. This was not the first time that Parliament passed the bill unanimously and realised later that the executive had mala fide intent. On December 24, 2018, the government registered a bill in the federal parliament to amend a few laws. It included a proposal to revise the Nepal Trust Act. The bill revising 56 different laws was tabled for deliberations in the House of Representatives on January 1, 2019 and it was endorsed on February 15 unopposed. The National Assembly endorsed it on March 2 that year, before President Bidya Devi Bhandari authenticated it the very next day. However, the issue came to light only when the Oli government decided to lease out the land under the trust to the Yeti Group. Even the lawmakers who had voted for the revision criticised the law, having overlooked the issue during deliberations in the House.Legal experts say such incidents happen when the lawmaking process is not participatory and parliamentarians show little interest in study and deliberations. âThe lawmaking process must be participatory right from its drafting process. It must be discussed widely in the House to make sure that it serves a right cause,â said advocate Mohan Acharya. Amid widespread criticism that law-making lacks broad participation, a bill is under consideration in the House to ensure that legislation becomes a more consultative process.âThe bill, if passed, will ensure that bills are drafted after proper consultations with all stakeholders.

They split the party protesting against UML chair KP Sharma Oliâs decision to dissolve the House of Representatives twice.Following a poor performance in the 2022 elections, where it failed even to secure the status of the national party, the CPN (Unified Socialist) is now struggling to retain party members. Despite holding important portfolios in the federal and provincial governments, the party leaders are finding it difficult even to stop its members from rejoining their old party, the UML, let alone attracting new members.Amid the diminishing influence, the party is gearing up for the general convention scheduled for June 30 to July 4 in Kathmandu.If the claims recently made by the leaders are anything to go by, the two former prime ministersâNepal and Khanalâwill face each other for the position of party chief during the general convention. Both of the leaders also led the CPN-UML in the past.Khanal on Monday emphasised the need of electing the party leadership through a consensus.While addressing the event to launch âMahila Sankalpa-2â, which is the mouthpiece of the partyâs womenâs wing, All Nepal Womenâs Association, Khanal stressed the need for a consensual election of the leaders. However, a certain criteria of leadership should be followed, Khanal said.âTo strengthen the leadership within the party, we must select the leaders of the party through a consensus,â Khanal said during the programme. âSince our party was formed on the basis of an ideological ground, political direction, and certain policies and principles, we all should strive to maintain these values while selecting the leadership as well.âA party insider claimed that Khanal staked his claim for the top position as his political line was adopted in the political document to be presented in the general convention. Party general secretary Ghanashyam Bhusal prepared the political document to be presented in the general convention of the party. While in the UML, party chair Nepal embraced Madan Bhandariâs Peopleâs Multi-party Democracy unconditionally for many years while Khanal and Bhusal viewed it critically. According to party leaders, Khanal and Bhusal have succeeded in including their ideas in the Unified Socialistâs official line.âIn politics, the leaders whose policies prevail as the partyâs official line should get the opportunity to lead the party,â a party leader told the Post on the condition of anonymity. âThough the political document of the party is guided by the thoughts of general secretary Bhusal, Khanal also owns it, so he is claiming the leadership.âThis does not mean that party chair Nepal has not owned the political document passed by the party's central committee, but the document is closer to the political line advocated by Bhusal and Khanal for a long time, said a party insider.Party chair Nepal, while addressing the same programme on Monday, also said that there are no differences among the leaders in terms of the partyâs ideological line. âThe preparation of the political, organisational and other documents to be presented in the upcoming congress is a collective effort of party leaders and cadres,â Nepal said.In addition to Nepal and Khanal, the party's general secretary Bhusal is also considering contesting for the party chair in the upcoming congress, though he has not publicly announced it yet.âMatters related to the aspiration of the leaders for the post of office bearers will be clear only after the selection of convention representatives,â Jeevan Ram Shrestha, the secretary of the party, told the Post. âBefore the selection of the representatives, all things that have come from the media are mere speculation.âThe party has decided to select general convention representatives from around the country on Wednesday. Shrestha said that the selection of representatives will make things clearer about the aspirantsâ claims.Khanal has already opened his contact office at Baneshwar with a plan to manage his teamâs activities during the general convention.Though Khanal has opened his contact office, he may or may not contest for the vital post, says another leader of the party who does not want to disclose his identity. The leader said that it might be under his publicity strategy. âIf the political scenario is not in his favour, Khanal might back Bhusal for the leadership of the party to challenge Nepal,â the leader claimed. âOn the other hand, Nepal, the present chair of the party, might also back Bhusal if he senses a tough challenge from Khanal.âBhusal has remained tightlipped about his candidacy in view of the situation, a leader close to Bhusal said. âIf the two top leaders decide to face each other, Bhusal might settle with his current position of general secretary.âThe partyâs deputy general secretaries, Jagan Nath Khatiwada and Parkash Jwala, have already announced their bid for the post of general secretary.The party will most likely select the leadership through consensus, says another leader. Meanwhile, there are voices in favour of continuing present chair Nepal in the position saying that he has put utmost efforts to establish the party after the split and sustain it amid a challenging situation. But there are also leaders who want Khanalâs leadership.âOne of the two leaders will possibly lead the party,â Unified Socialist leader Som Prasad Pandey, who is close to Nepal, told the Post. âThough Bhusalâs name is also in the discussion for the post of chair, he is most likely to continue as the general secretary.âMeanwhile, former CPN-UML vice-chair Bhim Rawal, who has remained inactive in the UML after the party's convention held in November 2021 in Chitwan, is reportedly considering joining the Unified Socialist from the upcoming congress. In 2021, Rawal challenged Oli for the position of party chair despite Oliâs request not to do so. Since then, Rawal has been given no role in the UML.âOur party is in talks with Bhim Rawal to bring him to the party. We have already held two rounds of negotiation with him,â Shrestha, the secretary, told the Post. âIf everything goes as planned, Rawal will join our party with a respectable position.âThe Postâs attempts to contact Rawal to confirm Shresthaâs claim were unsuccessful.

Oli criticised Finance Minister Barsha Man Punâs budget as favouring âone man, one partyâ, expressing his concerns over low allocations for the UML-led ministries.On the other hand, speaking at a party function on Friday, Minister Shrestha of the RSP said they would quit the government if they had to make âunnecessary compromisesâ. âThat is why our resignation letters are in our pockets,â he said. âAs soon as we start feeling frustrated, we will put in our papers.âThese two back-to-back statements by Oli and Shrestha sparked speculations about a growing rift between Oli, Dahal, and other ruling partners.But Prime Minister Dahal, talking to reporters at Bharatpur airport on Monday, said: âHe pretended to criticise, he has not genuinely criticised.ââThis government will continue until the end of its term. The rumours [about rifts] are unfounded,â said Dahal.The prime minister also subtly responded to the statement made by minister Shrestha, acknowledging that it is typical of the RSPâs stance, but reiterated that the government would complete its full term. âCarrying resignation letters in pocket is the identity of the RSP,â said Dahal. âBut that does not mean they will withdraw support.â Dahal also ruled out the possibility of removing Nepal Police IGP Basanta Kunwar from his post. There were some media reports that Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane was trying to remove IGP Kuwar due to some differences. âRecently, I called a meeting of all three security chiefsâof the Nepal Police, the Armed Police Force and the National Investigation Departmentâand clearly told them to work with high morale. No one is going to remove any security chief,â the prime minister told reporters. âThese are all rumours.â Sources close to the prime minister said that UML chairman Oli was also against an abrupt removal of the Nepal Police chief. As rumours about the police chiefâs potential removal spread, Nepal Police headquarters issued a statement on Sunday refuting these claims, describing the media reports as baseless. One senior RSP leader told the Post that Minister Shrestha has serious differences with some office-bearers of the Nepal Sports Council and that Shrestha is unhappy with lack of cooperation from bureaucrats and officials. âBoth Dahal and Oli understand the RSPâs strength and they donât want to let us go,â the RSP leader said. âItâs just that some of our friends want to make public the difficulties they faced in the first 100 days in government.â According to Prime Minister Dahal, âRabiji [Lamichhane] has always said that he leads a force that is different from other parties and if it cannot deliver, it will quit the government.â âSo it is not surprising to hear the RSP leaders talk like that. But as far as I understand, the RSP is not quitting the government,â Dahal added. One UML central committee member said that as the leader of the largest coalition partner, Oli has some compulsions, which is why he made such statements. âSome Maoist leaders accused Oli of trying to micromanage the government, which is not true. Our party has given Prime Minister Dahal a free hand and will help him in every step,â the UML central committee member said. Janamat Party chief CK Raut told the Post that there are no substantive differences within the ruling parties and some comments the media have been citing are quite harmless. The prime minister has already asked Raut to join the government. âThe government is not in crisis as some sections of the media are reporting. Some innocuous statements have been blown out of proportion,â said Raut, whose party is preparing to join the government after the budgetâs parliamentary approval. At Oliâs suggestion, Raut was offered the post of foreign minister in a cabinet reshuffle, according to sources. But Raut remains undecided. âNothing has been finalised,â said Raut. âAs far as my joining the government is concerned, I am in favour of supporting the government from the outside. But some of our friends will join.âÂ  "},{"hash":"b83c6217cd519cec2e48e38b869d002c56a4f7be6d4d2449e9be4a6a74a3c4f1","title":"ngo-sponsored-meals-kill-house-committee-s-appetite-for-deliberations","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/06/17/ngo-sponsored-meals-kill-house-committee-s-appetite-for-deliberations","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2019/default/WhatsAppImage20240617at072445-1718588523.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1718582400000,"source":"kp","category":"politics","content":"There's a debate over whether non-profit organizations (NGOs) should attend meetings where laws are made.\n\nRecently, an NGO provided breakfast and lunch at a lawmaking meeting, which caused a stir among the lawmakers.\n\nSome argue that NGOs should be allowed to attend these meetings to provide input, while others believe that their presence could influence the lawmaking process.\n\nThe debate continues, with different perspectives on the role of NGOs in lawmaking.","summary":"Should non-governmental organisations be allowed in legislative committee deliberations? This age-old question has divided experts and legislators. While NGOs have long been active in Nepalâs lawmaking process, controversy flared anew when NGO representatives were found attending Sundayâs session of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of Parliament without the knowledge of many lawmakers. The committee was scheduled to discuss the federal civil code amendment bill with expert input from Umesh Mainali, the former chief of the Public Service Commission. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane was also present at the meeting. However, the meeting took an unexpected turn when lawmakers noticed an elaborate breakfast and lunch arrangement, a departure from usual tea and simple fare. This led to questions about the sponsorship.Upon noticing the breakfast arrangement in the committee hall, Nepali Congress lawmaker Hridaya Ram Thani approached the committee president for clarification. It was revealed that the breakfast was arranged by an NGO, whose representatives were present in the meeting hall, leading to an abrupt adjournment of the meeting without any agenda being discussed.âAfter knowing that the lunch was sponsored by an NGO, Home Minister Lamichhane left the meeting hall,â Thani told the Post. Before leaving, Lamichhane also questioned the committee chair stating that it was unacceptable to hold a meeting with the breakfast sponsored by an NGO, Thani said, quoting Lamichhane. The National Forum for Parliamentarians on Population and Development (NFPPD), an NGO, had sponsored the breakfast and lunch for lawmakers. Two representatives of the NGO, Ram Guragain and Arinika Rai, were present in the committee meeting hall. Amidst the disruption, committee members raised questions about the role of Ramhari Khatiwada, the Congress lawmaker who leads the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, concerning the NGOâs catering arrangements.But Khatiwada denied any involvement. âI was not aware of the presence of the NGO representatives in the meeting, or of the breakfast arrangement,â Khatiwada told the Post. âAfter we knew about it, we cancelled the meeting.â âThough other parliamentary committees might allow NGO representatives to attend meetings, our committee does not permit such things,â added Khatiwada. However, CPN-UML lawmaker Prithvi Subba Gurung dismissed the issue. âIf necessary, people from various walks of life can be invited to the committee to discuss various agenda,â Gurung told the Post. âThere was no reason for disruption.â Mainali, who was invited for his expert input to Sundayâs committee meeting, echoed Gurung and said various stakeholders can participate in committee discussions, but they are excluded when the committee engages in agenda-specific discussions. âIn my understanding, the controversy arose not due to the participation of the NGOâs representatives, but because of the breakfast and lunch they arranged,â Mainali told the Post. However, the committee member and lawmaker of Congress, Ishwari Devi Neupane, has a different view. Neupane argues that the presence of NGO representatives could influence a forum dedicated to formulating state laws. âIf we allow representatives of an NGO into committee meetings, other NGOs might seek similar permission, and this could impact the lawmaking process,â Neupane told the Post. âThat is why we questioned the presence of the NGO that sponsored todayâs breakfast and lunch.â Neupane stressed that while agendas can be openly discussed with the representatives of civil society and NGOs outside the committee hall, inviting them to committee meetings is a wrong practice. However, NFPPD representative Guragain, who was present at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee meeting, said his organisation directly deals with parliamentarians and is often invited to such meetings. âWe participated in Sundayâs discussion because we have been taking part in discussions in other committees as well,â Guragain told the Post. âWe had an invitation letter to the meeting from the parliamentary committee.âHowever, former minister Ramesh Nath Pandey says incorporating the agendas of INGOs and NGOs into the lawmaking process is wrong and such practice must end. Pandey said such influences were more visible during the constitution-drafting process. âExternal elements are present not only during the drafting of policy papers, but also in the workings of sensitive institutions and law drafting. As a result, our decision-making process is becoming ineffective,â Pandey said. âIf lawmakers acknowledge and rectify their past mistakes, things would improve.âÂ  "},{"hash":"1e7f8fab1c163365d76d5eeb70a6282f74f41fc1cb02bbe98813f5250e6d1f2f","title":"why-are-rsp-leaders-voicing-doubt-about-their-continuity-in-government","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/06/16/why-are-rsp-leaders-voicing-doubt-about-their-continuity-in-government","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2019/third-party/Untitled3-1718506735.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1718496000000,"source":"kp","category":"politics","content":"Whatâs cooking in the Rastriya Swatantra Party?

On Saturday, Minister for Youth and Sports Biraj Bhakta Shrestha of the same party remarked that the time has come to review their participation in the government and its support to the coalition.

Many wondered if Lamichhane had started getting frustrated with the government.Addressing a press briefing organised on the occasion of Lamichhaneâs 100 days in the home ministry, he said, âThough we are in government, we donât know who is exercising the state power. Power has been controlled by some others for a long time, and it is a bit difficult to break that nexus.â However, some lawmakers from the party the Post spoke to voiced ignorance of why the partyâs ministers were making such remarks. The RSP put on an impressive performance at the 2022 election, capitalising on the publicâs frustration with traditional parties. Minister Shrestha said they were treading a tough path and were ready to quit the government if they were coerced into making unnecessary compromises.Shrestha said that after they joined the government, they realised that the countryâs misgovernance was more serious than prevailing social malpractices. In the last week of December in 2022, Dahal became prime minister for the third time with the support of the CPN-UML and the RSP, among other parties. Dahal later ditched them and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new Cabinet.After 14 months, Dahal sent the Nepali Congress out of power and brought the UML and the RSP into the coalition on March 4 this year. Hundred days after the latest change in the power equation, statements from the leaders and ministers of the third-largest coalition partner have made watchers curious about their intentions. Asked what was going on inside their party, RSP lawmakers expressed their ignorance. They said they had no idea about the partyâs future moves and leadersâ mood as there had not been enough meetings, discussions, and interactions recently.âWe would know what is going on in the party and the government only if there were party meetings,â the lawmakers told the Post asking not to be named. âOnly a select group of leaders make partyâs decisions, and we are kept in the dark.â Kabindra Burlakoti, the party's deputy general secretary, however, tried to downplay Shrestha's statement as generic. He said Saturdayâs statement by the minister is nothing different from the ones party leaders have been saying since joining the government. His statement does not imply that the party is seeking to recall its ministers, added Burlakoti. âUntil our party has a free hand to work in the government, we are not considering withdrawing our support,â Burlakoti told the Post.Experts, however, say Lamichhane is trying to cover up his failure to deliver. The party that rose with tall promises made during the election campaign is failing to live up to its pledges. It has courted controversy in multiple cases, including the cooperative scam.âThe party has a free hand in the government,â Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, told the Post. âI see no reason for the party to blame its coalition partners.âAfter the Ilam-2 by-election on April 27, RSP General Secretary Mukul Dhakal travelled to various places to study the reasons for the partyâs defeat in the bypolls.During the general secretary's visit to various districts, well-wishers shared their advice that it would have been better had the party focused on organisation-building rather than joining the government, deputy general secretary Burlakoti said.âHowever, the party is not considering a radical move immediately,â Burlakoti added. âThe advice given to our general secretary during his nationwide tour was received as feedback. The party is in no mood to quit the government.âExperts, however, say RSP leaders might be anxious about the report and recommendations of the parliamentary probe committee formed to investigate the cooperative scam. Lamichhane has been accused of embezzling millions of rupees from various cooperatives when he managed the now shuttered television Galaxy 4K.The parliamentary committee has been mandated to figure out if the cooperative money was rerouted to the Gorkha Media Network. Lamichhane was the managing director of the media company that operated the television.âAnticipating the possible outcome of the probe, the RSP could have started to bargain with ruling partners,â Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, told the Post. âThey might have tried to use the situation to win public sentiment.âBut Burlakoti denied such a possibility. âWe are confident that our party president wonât be implicated by the probe,ââ he said. âThen there is no question our party leaders should be bargaining with the coalition partners.â ","summary":"Whatâs cooking in the Rastriya Swatantra Party? Why are the leaders of the fourth-largest party in the House of Representatives and the third-largest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Cabinet giving statements hinting at their possible exit from the government?Some remarks made by the RSP ministers have fuelled speculation. On Saturday, Minister for Youth and Sports Biraj Bhakta Shrestha of the same party remarked that the time has come to review their participation in the government and its support to the coalition.

Lawmaker Sharma said that in case of conflict between a central agency and a local unit, the federal government should show more restraint than the local government.âMayor Balendra Shahâs initiative to widen pavements at New Road is the right step for the general publicâs convenience,â Sharma told the House. âMayor Shah should be allowed to continue his work without any interference as what he is doing is absolutely right.âThe conflict escalated when the Road Division, under the federal government, intervened and paved the road cut by the metropolis on Monday. The metropolis had cleared stretches a few metres wide on either side of the road to create space for pavements. The dispute resulted in a standoff between those deployed by the Road Division and the Kathmandu municipal staff, with different people taking different sides. The tension eased without any untoward incident as the metropolis backed off after the federal government deployed police at the site.The Road Division, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is led by Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth, who is a UML secretary.

Congress lawmaker Arjun Narsingh KC said the conflict between the federal government and the Kathmandu mayor has raised serious questions about the federal governmentâs intent. KC stressed that cooperation and collaboration between the federal, provincial, and local governments is essential in avoiding conflict and resolving disputes between the three federal units. He said Articles 232 and 235 of the constitution and related schedules clearly define their jurisdictions.âThe recent conflict between the federal and local governments and the saga of making and breaking of a road section have raised serious questions,â KC said. He urged the government not to resort to violence and to resolve the issue in a rational way.Another Congress lawmaker, Kanti Sejuwal, also speaking in the zero hour of Parliament, questioned the government for clashing with the municipal authority. âEither we should scrap the Local Government Operation Act 2017, or the federal government should let Balendra work.âAs the Road Division intervened in Mayor Shahâs plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area, Sejuwal had expressed his anger at UML chair Oli.Following the federal agencyâs intervention, the mayor wrote on social media, alleging Oliâs involvement in the attempted illegal swapping of land at the Birtamode-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate worth billions of rupees. The largest party, the Congress, had been accusing the UML chief of being complicit in the land swap issue.A few days ago, Shah also engaged in a heated exchange with the KMCâs Ward 22 chairman Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member, over the sidewalk expansion. Even before that, municipal staff dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Kathmandu Road Division office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had inconvenienced the public.Earlier, on May 14, the Congress parliamentary party meeting had decided to raise the issue of the tea estate land in Parliament. The Oli government, formed after the 2017 general elections, allowed the owners of the tea estate to swap 343.19 bighas (232.43 hectares) of land it occupied, based on a revision to the Land Act (1964). The Act was revised in January 2020, under the Oli administration, introducing a provision for allowing a swap or selling of land to pay off the tea estateâs liabilities if it went into liquidation. Asked if the Congress had backed the mayor as he alleged the UML chair Oliâs involvement in the Tea Estate land scam, the Congress publicity department head Min Bahadur Bishwokarma denied it. âParty lawmakers including the general secretary must have backed the mayor as the New Road sidewalk issue is of public concern, and not necessarily because it involves the UML,â Bishwokarma said.

This was for the first time in years that the Kathmandu Valley was seeing motorist queues.The situation arose due to a protest launched by petroleum transport workers who stopped supplying fuel to private pumps. They were protesting against their employersâpetroleum dealersâaccusing them of not implementing the minimum wage for workers as fixed by the government and excluding them from the social safety net. According to petroleum workers, petroleum transportation is one of the most dangerous jobs, yet lacks a social safety net.The protest, which began Friday, took a nasty turn after private petrol pumps ran out of fuel on Monday. Frantic motorists then started queuing up at state-owned petrol pumps. Videos and photos immediately went viral on social media, showing never-ending lines in front of petrol stations owned by Nepal Police in Naxal and other fuel stations.âWeâve been waiting for an hour,â said Saroj Karki, whose motorbike was already running empty.âThis is totally frustrating. How can the government be so irresponsible,â said Karki, who was waiting at the Bhadrakali petrol pump run by the Nepal Army on Monday afternoon. Karki, a sales manager for a private company, said that he was scheduled to attend two meetings in different places. âIt's 12:30, and the queue hasnât moved at all. I donât know what to do.â However, the streets of the Valley saw less traffic pressure on Monday due to a public holiday. Since Friday, most private petrol pumps have hung up âno petrolâ signs. The issue was resolved late Monday afternoon after the government decided to form a committee to address the grievances of the petroleum transport workers. There are more than 2,100 petroleum transport workers in the country. People also expressed frustrations on social media. âOne thing I like about the proliferation of electric vehicles in Nepal is that we will not be held ransom by different cartels of labour, transporters, fuel station owners and an inefficient, corrupt, constantly No Oil Corporation (NOC)!â Sujeev Shakya wrote on X. Ajay Das posted a video on X showing a long queue of motorists. He wrote, âThis is not Kathmandu traffic, itâs the queue at Naxal Police petrol pump this morning.â On August 18 last year, the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security implemented the monthly wage of workers, except for tea estate workers, at Rs17,300 as per Section 106 of the Labour Act, 2017.

Similarly, the hourly wage for part-time workers has been fixed at Rs95 per hour.But the petroleum transport workers said they have not received the hiked monthly wages and allowances. âWe tried to settle the issue on Sunday morning but were not successful,â said Manoj Kumar Thakur, deputy director of Nepal Oil Corporation, the state-owned oil monopoly.The Kathmandu Valley consumes 700 kiloliters of petrol and 800 kiloliters of diesel daily. This requires 75-100 petroleum tankers to supply petrol and diesel from Thankot depo to different pumps in the Valley. On Saturday, the oil supplier reduced the prices of petroleum products. Petrol price was cut by Rs3 per litre to Rs165 per litre, while diesel and kerosene became cheaper by Re1 each, to Rs152 per litre.âDespite the monthly minimum salary of Rs17,300 determined by the Labour Act, we are receiving Rs8,000 to Rs10,000 per month.

As there is no specific treatment for dengue, officials said they are planning to train doctors to provide supportive care to seriously ailing dengue patients.âWe have been working to train doctors serving at state-run health facilities to treat dengue patients,â said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. âWe hope the training will help doctors manage cases more effectively.âDengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,175 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 122. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, increasing numbers of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as the outbreak of the virus is reported every month including in the winter months.Health authorities in Nepal claimed that lessons from managing Covid cases would help them combat other outbreaks, but the massive infections and spread of the dengue virus before the onset of the monsoon cast doubt on these claims.âEvery year, scores die and hundreds of thousands get infected from the dengue virus, but no agency in the country is doing much on disease prevention,â said Dr Baburam Marasini, a public health expert. âThere are three tiers of government in the country, and the relevant agency in each governmentâfederal, provincial and localâshifts responsibility to another.

Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death. ","summary":"As all efforts to control the vectors spreading the dengue virus have failed, health authorities in Nepal have shifted focus to case management. As there is no specific treatment for dengue, officials said they are planning to train doctors to provide supportive care to seriously ailing dengue patients.âWe have been working to train doctors serving at state-run health facilities to treat dengue patients,â said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. âWe hope the training will help doctors manage cases more effectively.âDengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,175 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 122. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, increasing numbers of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as the outbreak of the virus is reported every month including in the winter months.Health authorities in Nepal claimed that lessons from managing Covid cases would help them combat other outbreaks, but the massive infections and spread of the dengue virus before the onset of the monsoon cast doubt on these claims.âEvery year, scores die and hundreds of thousands get infected from the dengue virus, but no agency in the country is doing much on disease prevention,â said Dr Baburam Marasini, a public health expert. âThere are three tiers of government in the country, and the relevant agency in each governmentâfederal, provincial and localâshifts responsibility to another. When you ask the agency under the local level, they say they are not there to kill mosquitoes.âExperts say health authorities have done little to cut down on the risks, except counting the number of infected people and issuing statements.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessityâa space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an âoasisâ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. Itâs a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.âIn developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,â says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyoneâqueer and non-queer alikeâto share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.âI didnât want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,â Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikariâs identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. âAt first, I didnât understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,â Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding oneâs identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldnât afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.âDuring my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,â Adhikari says.âThe time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.âFour years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the cafÃ© because of its welcoming atmosphere.âItâs heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here.

We are all human,â he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.âLike how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,â he says. ","summary":"In a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessityâa space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an âoasisâ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. Itâs a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.âIn developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,â says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyoneâqueer and non-queer alikeâto share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.âI didnât want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,â Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikariâs identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. âAt first, I didnât understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,â Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding oneâs identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldnât afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.âDuring my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,â Adhikari says.âThe time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.âFour years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the cafÃ© because of its welcoming atmosphere.âItâs heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like âDahi Chiura Khane din,ââ she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. âI hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I donât think weâd have any other place to turn to,â she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, âThis is my safe space where I can truly be myself.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. âAll books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,â Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. âI donât know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.âTranslating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepalâs book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the whoâs who of the world literature. Such endeavours havenât just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. âThese translations are poor,â Baral says. âTomes with 1200â1300 pages have been trimmed to 200â300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.âAnother popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.âWe have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,â Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The bookâs Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: âAchyut Koirala, who has a masterâs in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.âKoirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasnât just translated the book but has also done âcreative writingâ with it.âRich Dad Poor Dadâ, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books thatâs perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the bookâall unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, âAt this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.âBasanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. âBut how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!â Thapa wonders. âReaders who havenât read the original wouldnât know the faults in the translated versions.â Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ârecreateâ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslimaâs books are the major victimsTaslimaâs memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as âSangharshaâ, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the bookâs sequel as âPrem ra Jeevanâ. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslimaâs permission. âAbout a decade back, we didnât know how to ask for permission,â he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody elseâs work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslimaâs anthology of essays No Country for Women as âAaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhainaâ. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. âI have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,â Pradhan, who is also a childrenâs book writer, says. âI just copy-edited it upon request.âBishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. âWe translated the book long ago,â he says. âWe are still trying to get translation rights.âIndigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrarâs Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. âAfter I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,â Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Kheraâs You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the bookâs unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they donât even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that itâd be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the authorâs permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldnât demand much for translation rights given Nepalâs small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. âPublishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,â he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harariâs bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the bookâs translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguruâs Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. âThis phenomenon not just hampers Nepalâs fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the countryâs reputation in the global market,â Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. âWe donât have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,â he says. âNobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.â Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.Oneâs pain, anotherâs pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, âThis is a pirated copy and Iâm the author of this book.â The youth wasnât bothered and replied, âOkay, you can buy it at a discount.âThis anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehtaâs friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. âWe sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,â says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepalâs image internationally. âThere was a time when Bangladesh would be known as âpiracy kingâ,â he said. âNow there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.âAs tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.âAfter the governmentâs decision, we stopped importing books for a while,â says Shrestha of Education Books. âThe import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.âPirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesnât levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. âThe government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the countryâs economy as well,â he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House Indiaâs sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. âTo confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,â Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, âKeeping ISBN number at oneâs will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.âBy the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrarâs office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Actâs clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Actâs subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Actâs clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the âimportation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.âIf anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provisionâs implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. âCreation is a crucial part of humanityâs benefit,â he says. âIf intellectual property is not protected effectively, then thereâd be no inspiration to create something.âBal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.âIn the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,â Mukhiya says. âBut in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.â(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) ","summary":"Nepalâs book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. âAll books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,â Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. âI donât know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.âTranslating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepalâs book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the whoâs who of the world literature. Such endeavours havenât just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. âThese translations are poor,â Baral says. âTomes with 1200â1300 pages have been trimmed to 200â300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.âAnother popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.âWe have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,â Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The bookâs Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: âAchyut Koirala, who has a masterâs in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.âKoirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasnât just translated the book but has also done âcreative writingâ with it.âRich Dad Poor Dadâ, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books thatâs perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the bookâall unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, âAt this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.âBasanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. âBut how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!â Thapa wonders. âReaders who havenât read the original wouldnât know the faults in the translated versions.â Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ârecreateâ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslimaâs books are the major victimsTaslimaâs memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as âSangharshaâ, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the bookâs sequel as âPrem ra Jeevanâ. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him.

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum Eastâa close-knit settlement of 425 housesâwas considered the Maoistsâ âbase areaâ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. âYouths started going to America about six-seven years ago,â he said. âIf they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.â Budhaâs own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the USâa country that the Maoists used to call their âenemyâ, an âimperialistic forceâ. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditorsâ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. âAfter the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldnât live in the village peacefully,â said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, âWhen will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!âDhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. âNow we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlalâs trip abroad],â Nanda Kala said. âThereâs no point staying here.âStories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. âItâs not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,â he said. âI aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.âFor six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. âWhen I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,â he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupakâs wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.âI still donât know what exactly happened,â said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupakâs trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, âI only have memories.âLack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, âWorkers of the world, unite!â, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, thereâs nothing he can do. âHow could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?â he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didnât herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. âMeter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,â he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dangâs Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. âOnly those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,â he said.One can infer from Pandeyâs statements that the families of such illegal travellers donât want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesnât include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the âbase areasâ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. âThis is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,â Shrestha said. âThe Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.â Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgencyâs âbase areasâ is due to the political systemâs abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. âThe traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,â he said. âDevelopments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.â(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. ","summary":"Bharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipalityâs ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via âtallo batoââbackdoor routeâand that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum Eastâa close-knit settlement of 425 housesâwas considered the Maoistsâ âbase areaâ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. âYouths started going to America about six-seven years ago,â he said. âIf they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.â Budhaâs own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the USâa country that the Maoists used to call their âenemyâ, an âimperialistic forceâ. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditorsâ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. âAfter the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldnât live in the village peacefully,â said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, âWhen will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!âDhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. âNow we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlalâs trip abroad],â Nanda Kala said. âThereâs no point staying here.âStories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. âItâs not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,â he said. âI aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.âFor six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. âWhen I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,â he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupakâs wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.âI still donât know what exactly happened,â said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupakâs trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, âI only have memories.âLack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, âWorkers of the world, unite!â, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, thereâs nothing he can do. âHow could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?â he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country.

The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldnât have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.âI didnât know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who canât afford hospital stays,â BK said. âBut even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital wonât willingly offer me the service.âThe Pokhara-based 50-bed hospitalâs Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. âWe donât have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,â said Aryal. âMoving forward, we will follow the instructions.â The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. âOur monitoring and inspection is also lax, thatâs why most hospitals ignore the rules,â he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. âOur manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,â he said. âWe need more people for thatâ. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. âThe hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,â said Khadka. âLegal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.â The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directiveâs implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The departmentâs chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. âHospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,â KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the âmedical cityâ  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical collegesâChitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciencesâthat also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.âAlthough the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,â said Chapagain. âOur department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading âDiscounts for the needyâ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.âMeanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. âThere are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. Thatâs why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,â said Adhikari.The monitoring bodiesâ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan Cityâs Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. âWe have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,â he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipalityâs health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. âHowever, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,â Bhattarai said. âWe found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.âThe hospitalâs director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. âBut the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,â he said. âThe metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.âButwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolisâ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the governmentâs health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitanâs health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.âI have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,â he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitanâs Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospitalâs help. âThe hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,â he said. âI had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.âDr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. âPatients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,â she said. âI was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,â said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. âThey do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,â he said. âThe sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.âÂ  ","summary":"Gyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while.

In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Postâs Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Letâs begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship cardâto open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cardsâone is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the personâs activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categoriesâdemographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric dataâfingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single cardâNational ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, âno, I have a National ID cardâ. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says donât ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies donât accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didnât help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepalâs total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people donât need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isnât misused and it doesnât make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you donât need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it canât be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has âterrorised peopleâ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the driveâs completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 havenât contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilitiesâ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesnât need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectorsâbanking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I donât register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isnât misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isnât misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of securityâL1, L2, L3âto ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded.
