Both countries cooperate in the multi-sectoral forum including the UN on sustainable development and climate change, the shared issues of both nations. \nPresident Paudel on Tuesday addressed the \"World Leaders Climate Action Summit\" a high-level session held under the ongoing COP29.\n During the conference, Nepal on Wednesday hosted a separate high-level special session on \"Addressing Loss and Damage in Mountains,\" drawing the global attention to its agenda of concerns. The President hoped that such discussions would help find a better understanding of the issue and explore practical solutions.\nHe also addressed an event organized by Kyrgyzstan. \nHe also attended the group meeting held by United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres with the Heads of State and Government of underdeveloped countries who gathered in Baku to take part in the COP 29 conference. The President utilized the meeting to urge the UN Secretary-General to make the developed countries serious about the impact of climate change. \nThe conference that commenced on November 11 will continue until November 22.  President Paudel landed in Baku on last Monday, leading the high-level delegation to the conference. He is today scheduled to leave Baku for Doha of Qatar en route to home. He will reach Kathmandu on Friday morning.\n---\nPowered By  Orson Infotech\n\n\n"},{"hash":"66110b62818cbd8c1e2c827557957450732e518a2ae54fa4451dfa2b975d31c3","title":"govt-to-expand-the-tax-base","date":1731715200000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/business/govt-to-expand-the-tax-base","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/Damodar_Bhandari_1_768x3831731744034_1024.jpg","category":"business","content":"\n    BANKE: Minister for Industry, Commerce, and Supplies, Damodar Bhandari, stated that the government’s priority is to expand the tax base, rather than raising tax rates.Speaking at a program organized by the Internal Revenue Office in Nepalgunj today in observance of National Tax Day and Tax Week, Minister Bhandari outlined the government's efforts to broaden the tax net and enhance the tax system.\n\"A strong state ensures the growth of robust industries and businesses.

Their arrival in last October rose by 12.88 per cent compared to the previous month. In October, 16,023 American tourists came to Nepal while 10,084 visited in last September. \nSimilarly, 8019 tourists arrived from the UK, 6,929 from Australia, 6,018 from Germany and 5,485 from France, 4,476 from Bangladesh, 3,112 from Sri Lanka and 2,635 from Italy visited Nepal in the last 10 months of the current fiscal year.\nIn 2024, March reported the highest number of tourists at 128,167 while July saw the lowest at 64,599, according to the Board.\n\n"},{"hash":"a5b8499bc3d6947cd86aa98b9d4ce7c31cdd72df4fd657ede90aa916df519a4b","title":"flights-to-remote-mountainous-districts-affected","date":1730678400000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/travel-and-tourism/flights-to-remote-mountainous-districts-affected","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/airport1730707365_1024.jpg","category":"travel-and-tourism","content":"\n    KATHMANDU: Flights have been generally affected today due to adverse weather.

Jointly led by Prakash Subedi, a Technical Project Manager in BMW's 5G Research and Development team, and his wife, Srishti Gaihre Subedi, a Senior Software Engineer at SAP, the initiative offered students a hands-on glimpse into the world of engineering. After returning from Germany, the couple volunteered their expertise to inspire young minds in Chitwan, conducting this free training to foster enthusiasm for technology and robotics. The program was supported by the German organization GIZ, Diaspora 2030, and the Education Development and Coordination Unit, Chitwan, under the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology, providing local students a unique opportunity to engage with cutting-edge science and technology over an intensive 15-day training period. The workshops, held at SOS Hermann Gmeiner School Bharatpur, Narayani Model Secondary School, and Prembasti Secondary School, reached students from grades 7 to 11, primarily in grades 9 and 10. Each student learned to build and program obstacle-avoiding robots using kits containing Arduino Uno microcontrollers, ultrasonic sensors, servo motors, motor controller boards, and motors. The immersive experience allowed students to gain practical skills in electronics, coding, and robotics, while also encouraging them to explore engineering, artificial intelligence, and problem-solving approaches.Prakash noted the importance of hands-on learning, saying, 'In Germany and other European countries, it's common for students to get practical experience in robotics and programming. However, such opportunities are rare in Nepalese schools. We wanted to provide students with a sense of what's possible in engineering, AI, and problem-solving, helping them understand how technology can be used to tackle real-world challenges and inspiring them to pursue these skills beyond the classroom.' Approximately 40% of participants were girls, indicating a growing interest among both genders in technical fields.\nThe project was made possible with support from the Diaspora 2030 initiative, which connects skilled diaspora professionals with their home countries to foster positive change in education, technology, and skill development. Saurav Koirala from GIZ Kathmandu expressed his happiness with the achievements of the project, highlighting its alignment with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4, which promotes quality education. He remarked that projects like this are vital in raising local educational standards and inspiring students to explore STEM fields.Srishti emphasized her dedication to gender diversity in engineering, saying, 'There are very few females in engineering, and I wanted to motivate students - especially girls - to explore this field.'She shared an emotional moment from the workshop when Bikisha Acharya, a trainee from Prembasti Secondary School, expressed her desire to become an engineer like Srishti. 'It was a very touching experience for me,' Srishti said. 'Knowing that we are inspiring young girls to see themselves in these roles is incredibly meaningful.'\nThe training concluded with a robotics competition titled 'Robo-Quest 2024: Ignite the Spark' at SOS Hermann Gmeiner School. The competition featured 55 students selected from an internal evaluation among the trainees, forming six teams of three from SOS, Narayani Model, and Prembasti schools. SOS Hermann Gmeiner School emerged as the winner, securing a cash prize of 5,000 NPR, with Prembasti Secondary School and Narayani Model Secondary School securing the second and third places, winning 4,000 and 3,000 NPR, respectively. \nBishnu Prasad Bhattarai, Unit Chief of the Education Development and Coordination Unit, Chitwan, and Bhumi Lal Sharma Subedi, Undersecretary at the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology, praised the initiative, stating, 'Training and competitions like these attract students toward science and technology.

Disparities in access and capacity continue to threaten progress toward the 2030 Agenda.\"\nHe underlined the need for intensifying initiatives and innovative works to minimize the gaps, which, Junhua argued, may not be bridged by 2030 irrespective of the positive developments and projections. \nThe UN E-Government Survey was prepared by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the (UN DESA), through its Division for Public Institutions and Digital Government (DPIDG). \nThe Global E-Government Survey has been continued for two decades with biennial publications.\nThe EGDI components are online services index, telecommunications infrastructure index and the human capital index; while LOSI has the components as institutional framework, services provision, content provision, technology, e-participation and e-government literacy. \nNepal improves score, registered as one among LDCs in leading digital development\nTo a positive remark, Nepal has made a significant stride in digital adoption since 2022. \nThe report stated, \"Among the LDCs, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Rwanda, Nepal, Cambodia, and Zambia have been leading  digital development since 2022, and Senegal and Myanmar have joined these high performers in  2024.\"\nNepal is listed as one among twenty-five countries categorized as the middle OSI group. Some of them in this category are Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Botswana and Cambodia.\nDespite this, Nepal is still behind many countries. Globally, among total UN member states, Nepal stands at 119 with an EGDI score of 0.5781.\nMeanwhile, the list of countries at the top of EGDI rankings are Denmark, Estonia, Singapore, Iceland, the Republic of Korea, and Saudi Arabia. They have displayed robust digital leadership as per the report.\nSimilarly, India's global rank in EGDI is 97, China's 35, Bangladesh's 100, and Bhutan's 103.\nIn the global ranking of EGDI Report, 2022, Nepal had stood at 125. \n"},{"hash":"3e49be559e8d3f01955d46018a7ce2c9d9d55f5bb4b3c1e0b2c9d912b7ff6353","title":"news-commentary-digital-nepal-leave-no-one-behind-in-campaign","date":1726099200000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/science-and-technology/news-commentary-digital-nepal-leave-no-one-behind-in-campaign","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/naryan_ghimere1726152408_1024.jpg","category":"science-and-technology","content":"\n    Narayan Prasad Ghimire/RSS\nKathmandu, Sept 12: A recent news story from Banke district stated that a girl child contracted Japanese encephalitis, but it was not sure whether she was immunized against the life-threatening disease earlier. \nThere is a government provision that children from 12 to 23 months since birth are administered the vaccine against this virus, but the data/information was not available.

They agreed to watch the movement of third-country nationals across the border, according to the official.“They [Indian officials] indicated the movement of Chinese and Pakistani nationals from our border and we also expressed concerns about the Rohingya refugees as well as Bangladeshi nationals who started coming to Nepal after the recent political turmoil in Bangladesh,” the official added.Rishi Ram Tiwari, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, said, “We discussed a slew of issues related to boundary, border, human trafficking, checking cross-border criminal activities and coordination between the two agencies in border areas.” The meeting has been held annually since 2012, except for disruptions caused by various problems including the Covid pandemic. The primary objective of the meeting is to discuss issues of mutual concern such as corruption, drug trafficking, customs evasion and smuggling as well as carrying out activities like joint patrolling of the border and maintenance of border pillars.“We reviewed the work done in the past year and progress made on different fronts, as well as the challenges,” said Tiwari.They stressed the need to take the ongoing coordination between the two agencies down to lower levels so that both sides can control cross-border crimes and other illicit activities.All necessary works on the border will be carried out jointly, he said.The APF has set up 244 outposts along Nepal’s border with India while India has over 400 posts. Both security agencies are repairing and maintaining boundary pillars, currently in Kalapani of Darchula and Susta of Nawalparasi West.“Our major concerns are drug trafficking from the Indian side and smuggling of goods from India,” the security official said. “We are focusing on effective communication and timely information sharing between the two security agencies to combat this perennial crisis.”In the meeting, officials are discussing matters like setting up ‘border tourist posts’ in order to manage the movement of people through better record-keeping, and desks at every security unit guarding the international border. The Nepali side has also raised the matter of SSB personnel often illegally entering the Nepali territory and creating trouble for the people in bordering settlements.Joint tackling of natural disasters; preparing manpower to respond to natural disasters affecting both sides of the border; and combating the business of drugs, alcohol and other substances are also on the agenda.After failing to hold the meeting of the Boundary Working Group, both sides have now entrusted the APF and the SSB with maintaining and repairing boundary pillars.Nepal and India have put up 8,553 boundary pillars while over 2,700 have gone missing but erecting new boundary markers and maintenance of the damaged ones is carried out simultaneously.At the last meeting, both sides unanimously resolved to implement additional measures to strengthen coordination and collaboration between the two border forces. Emphasis was laid on curbing trans-border crimes, smuggling of arms and ammunition, as well as combating human trafficking along the open and porous Nepal-India border.The help desks established by both the APF and the SSB at major transit points facilitate the movement of citizens, particularly during festive seasons, according to the SSB.There was also consensus on expanding exchange programmes and exposure visits between the forces as part of mutual capacity-building, according to a statement issued after the last meeting.The joint mechanism was established for better coordination between the two security agencies; to exchange critical information; curb trans-border crimes; share intelligence inputs in a timely manner; create a mechanism to combat trans-border crimes collaboratively; and facilitate timely sharing of information.

Two years after co-founding Bhoomithan — which means sacred Earth — Karmacharya feels that he can work more effectively to bring environmental solutions to Nepal. Most recently, Karmacharya and Goonja Shrestha, Bhoomithan’s other co-founder who is also married to Karmacharya, have focused on recycling flowers to make phoolbatti, or rope incense. As of Monday, the couple has gathered 84.7 kgs of donated flowers from Tihar that would have otherwise been thrown away. For months Karmacharya and Shrestha have been developing a sustainable alternative to typical stick incense. The couple knew a craftswoman who makes incense out of lokta paper, and they spent six months working together to develop six different scents of rope incense made in part from recycled flowers. “People use the stick incense because they think it smells good, but it's all infused with chemicals,” Shrestha says.Karmacharya and Shrestha sort and dry the flowers on their terrace for three days, then put them into a dehydrator, and finally blend the dried petals into powder. They distribute the materials to five women who twist the powder and other ingredients into the rope incense. The couple then sells the products mostly at local farmers' markets. Anjana Malla, founder of Deego Nepal, a sustainable brand that offers plastic-free personal and home products, donated a bag of flowers in Lalitpur on Friday. In the biodegradable bag made out of cornstarch, not only did she bring her own flowers, but also flowers that she gathered from her friends and nearby businesses. “In every shop, people put flowers for decoration for Tihar,” Malla says. “There are so many shops that I see flowers, and they are thrown away.”Shrestha encountered some difficulty convincing people to donate their flowers because some believed that the flowers should be thrown in the river as a part of religious practice. “It’s very hard to penetrate that belief,” Shrestha says. Malla hopes that people will also see the religious value in using flowers to make incense. “When we take the flowers, we convert them into something that you use for worship,” Karmacharya says. “When we talk to the community, most of them understand.” The flower recycling project isn’t the first time Karmacharya and Shrestha have brought sustainability to religious practice. For their first project, Bhoomithan replaced the non-native trees on the Swayambhunath hill with native trees that provide food and shelter to the monkeys and birds that inhabit the area. They prioritised biodiversity and sustainability with this project by following the Japanese Miyawaki tree-planting method: planting a variety of native trees and plant species among one another, to mimic the growth of a natural forest. “There's biodiversity, diverse trees that support each other and when you plant it, you plant it like a jungle,” Karmacharya said.Karmacharya still serves on the board of Clean Up Nepal, though these days he is focusing more on Bhoomithan’s mission. As opposed to Clean Up Nepal, an organization that has two offices, 21 staff members, and an annual budget that has ballooned from two million rupees eight years ago to fifty million rupees today, Bhoomithan has a core workforce of only three people. At Bhoomithan, Karmacharya feels as though he has to deal with fewer hurdles with each project.“When [the organization] is big, you lose touch,” he says. “With the donor’s pressure, even though the solutions are easy, we just go round and round. We are not allowed to solve it somehow.” Bhoomithan functions as a non-profit company, and aims to fund itself through its products, to avoid the administrative burden associated with relying on big donors. Bhoomithan aims to prioritise the planet, people, and profit — in that order. “Planet comes first, then its people, and then hopefully profit,” says Karmacharya.This profit doesn’t go to Karmacharya and Shrestha, but rather funds Bhoomithan’s next projects. “We have to make a profit, so that we don't go back to being an NGO and relying on donors,” Shrestha says. “We want to work for impact, and for that we understand that we have to make profit.”Shrestha hopes that Bhoomithan will inspire people to love Earth. “We want people to understand that they are part of a very big system, and they are part of a very deep ecology, and they have to understand and respect mother nature,” she says.The couple is currently working on developing environmental education workshops. Eventually, they hope to purchase land for Bhoomithan’s headquarters, where they can bring people in to learn about sustainability and observe a sustainable living space firsthand.

Even as the Nepali public was deeply invested in discussing his impending visit to China, scheduled for December, a media report suggests he may go to India first, after all.Normally, a bilateral visit would be a normal affair. Not this time. Oli’s upcoming visit to China has become mired in geopolitical tension, domestic political conflict and potential embarrassments.It’s unfortunate. Nepal has once again failed to manage the India-China rivalry in a respectable and diplomatic manner. If Oli visits India first, it would likely result in the postponement or even cancellation of his visit to China.Whether Oli visits India first or not, two factors make his visit to China significant.The first is Nepal’s seriousness in Nepal-China relations. As Nepal prepares for Oli’s visit to China, news reports in the Nepali media indicate foreign policy disarray and lack of understanding about relations with China at the highest levels. Nepal has been repeatedly making the same commitments to China and reiterating the same agreements. In the last seven years, there has been little progress on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) or on a majority of agreements that Nepal has signed.The second is the failure of Chinese loans. As Oli goes to China, he takes with him a humiliating baggage: A message that Chinese loans in Nepal’s tourism sector have failed because of corruption and kickbacks. This fact is all the more embarrassing because top political leaders in Nepal are responsible for the failures much more than the Chinese companies or China Exim Bank, which financed the projects.Foreign policy disarrayDespite a series of snubs from India, Oli had been postponing his China visit, hoping for an invitation from the southern neighbour. After India sidelined him, Nepali media and political society picked up on him and raised questions about the stability of the government.Only last week, the Nepali Congress (NC) and the Unified Marxist-Leninist (UML) formed a bi-partisan mechanism under the leadership of Oli and NC President and former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba.The most significant decision of the first meeting concerned Oli's visit to China. According to the mechanism’s press statement, “the preparation of the official visit” would be “coordinated” by Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba. The simplest meaning of this decision is that Oli wants to show NC’s full political support for his impending visit. This could be intended both for China and India.For India, this shows that Oli’s visit to China would consider India’s concerns. For China, the backing of the NC would be of great value. The main reason why the BRI has not moved ahead is NC’s reluctance to enter into commercial loan deals with China. As a signatory, the party must show commitment to BRI and Nepal-China relations.Although Oli wants to build rapport with India, his habit of making petty remarks and stoking anti-Indian sentiment has created a deep rift. This time around, after he became prime minister, he prioritised having a one-on-one meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was for this reason that although Oli was invited to visit China, he has repeatedly delayed, hoping to visit India first. Until now, he has been repeatedly snubbed, while his Foreign Minister, Rana, was given extra recognition.Finally, on November 5, China invited Oli for an official visit, although China has not officially announced the visit yet.The series of events in the last two months shows that Oli’s focus is personal rather than national. According to a former senior diplomat, who has overseen several state visits, Nepali leaders often emphasise one-on-one meetings with Chinese and Indian political leaders. Such meetings, according to him, are often harmful for Nepal’s national interest because they focus on personal transactional relations rather than on overall bilateral relations.All the hullabaloo has generated great expectations from Oli’s India and China visits, which will put the PM under tremendous pressure to make his visit successful. According to former ministers and senior party leaders across all parties, the “success” of such visits often affects the “survivability” of governments and weakens Nepal’s negotiation capacity.The embarrassment of Chinese loansThe failure of Pokhara International Airport and the Nepal Airlines’ decision to dispose of Chinese aircraft have dented China’s reputation.The Pokhara Regional International Airport currently operates only domestic flights (other than eight international flights so far), and the revenue is insufficient to service loans. In fact, the current expected revenue of around Rs300 million is less than a tenth of the Rs2.4 billion it needs to pay China Exim Bank every year. This has forced Nepali politicians to seek diplomatic solutions. The disposal of Chinese aircraft has also turned into a complex diplomatic challenge for Nepal. The Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) is eager to sell the grounded aircraft at scrap value, but the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu is worried about sending the wrong message. Nepal's government officials acknowledge that \"there is no way to pay the loan.\"The challenges now extend beyond the immediate financial losses to questions about Nepal's capacity to protect its interests. The two cases show that Nepal often has weak negotiating capacity, fails to make robust technical assessments—or these assessments are ignored by political actors—and lacks accountability mechanisms.The request for loan forgiveness of Chinese aircraft and Pokhara International Airport has already created diplomatic sensitivities. The primary fault lies with both Nepali decision-makers and Chinese companies who have colluded in corruption. Nepali leaders created the problem in the first place, driven by greed and corruption. Now, they want the Chinese President to intervene and forgive their loans.These issues are certain to have reached the highest political levels in China. Given Chinese leaders' commitment to tackling corruption, there are grounds to be hopeful that such mistakes will not happen in the future. It can only portend well for Nepal.While Nepali agencies may be shackled by political actors in investigating possible cases of corruption, the Chinese government is likely to have already investigated the cases from their side and gathered evidence about the financial transactions, kickbacks and bribes received by Nepali counterparts. This could prove to be tricky for Nepali leaders and officials involved in corruption.Nepal can choose not to take loans from China—it is a matter of government policy. But Nepal’s relations with China are deeper and wider than that. Political leaders cannot choose to use relations with China as a means to play against India or to project power in the domestic political landscape. The relationship with China is a serious and important matter. Nepali leaders should not let geopolitics and diplomatic incompetence affect Nepal’s trusted, stable and friendly relations with its northern neighbour. If Oli is to visit China, he must have a concrete plan on how to make progress on the commitments the two countries have made during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Nepal in 2019. ","summary":"Prime Minister Oli’s geopolitical game has reached a new low. Even as the Nepali public was deeply invested in discussing his impending visit to China, scheduled for December, a media report suggests he may go to India first, after all.Normally, a bilateral visit would be a normal affair. Not this time. Oli’s upcoming visit to China has become mired in geopolitical tension, domestic political conflict and potential embarrassments.It’s unfortunate. Nepal has once again failed to manage the India-China rivalry in a respectable and diplomatic manner. If Oli visits India first, it would likely result in the postponement or even cancellation of his visit to China.Whether Oli visits India first or not, two factors make his visit to China significant.The first is Nepal’s seriousness in Nepal-China relations. As Nepal prepares for Oli’s visit to China, news reports in the Nepali media indicate foreign policy disarray and lack of understanding about relations with China at the highest levels. Nepal has been repeatedly making the same commitments to China and reiterating the same agreements. In the last seven years, there has been little progress on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) or on a majority of agreements that Nepal has signed.The second is the failure of Chinese loans. As Oli goes to China, he takes with him a humiliating baggage: A message that Chinese loans in Nepal’s tourism sector have failed because of corruption and kickbacks. This fact is all the more embarrassing because top political leaders in Nepal are responsible for the failures much more than the Chinese companies or China Exim Bank, which financed the projects.Foreign policy disarrayDespite a series of snubs from India, Oli had been postponing his China visit, hoping for an invitation from the southern neighbour.

Every country requires a robust military to ensure the national security, personal security, happiness and prosperity of its citizens. Beyond sheer hard power, however, soft power elements like military diplomacy play an equally significant role in national strength. South African researchers Martin Edmonds and Greg Mills define military diplomacy as “the use of armed forces (except warfare) to achieve national goals.” This principle should be a guiding force for our military diplomacy strategy.Through goodwill exchanges, joint training exercises and defense cooperation, militaries worldwide can foster stronger ties and shared understanding. In recent years, such a diplomacy has become an indispensable tool in foreign policy, enabling nations to advance their security interests with mutual discussion and harmony without resorting to conflict.In Nepal, military diplomacy is unique and well-documented in its military history. Today, our diplomatic engagements extend to multiple countries, including India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Western countries like the United States, Canada, and Germany among others. India stands out as a vital partner and key supplier of defense materials for the Nepali Army. This article focuses on the potential and depth of Nepal’s military diplomacy with India in the context of the visit of two Indian security chiefs—Indian Army chief Upendra Dwivedi and SSB chief Amrit Mohan Prasad—this month. SignificanceThe friendship between Nepal and India is underpinned by deep-rooted people-to-people connections. Since 1950, both countries have conferred the rank of Honorary General upon each other’s army chiefs, which shows the mutual respect and trust shared by the two armies. Moreover, India’s contributions to the modernisation of the Nepali Army have been substantial. As India rises as a global military power, Nepal can benefit from its experiences. India’s transformative initiatives—force restructuring, the incorporation of advanced technology and enhanced efficiency—offer valuable insights. India’s strides in self-reliance under the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (Self-Reliant India) initiative have further reduced its dependence on foreign suppliers, allowing it to export high-value defense products. Similarly, Nepal could also develop its indigenous capabilities and reduce external dependency on its defense in the future.A sovereign nation is never defined as large or small. The goodwill and support extended to neighbours affirm the harmony between neighbouring countries. We will not remain in the same situation of security forever; our priorities are ever-changing, and military diplomacy is an effective way to navigate unforeseen security challenges.Addressing common concernsNepal and India share a long, open border, which, while facilitating mutual access, can lead towards unexpected transnational security challenges. Clear communication between top leaders is essential to prevent misunderstandings. Regular high-level military visits can help address security concerns and strengthen mutual trust. The Nepal-India Bilateral Consultative Group Mechanism is also an effective diplomatic platform for such works. It is worth noting that Nepal’s former Chief of Army Staff played a key role in breaking the impasse during the 2015 Indian blockade. Regional security concerns extend beyond traditional military issues. These days, climate-related disasters, transnational threats and terrorism have become key considerations. The October 2023 glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in Sikkim, which led to the collapse of the Teesta III hydroelectric dam, was one of the worst climate-induced disasters in the region. Nepal is also susceptible to similar GLOF events. The Thyambo glacial lake outburst flood, which swept away Thame village in the Khumbu region on August 16, 2024, is a recent example. Given the national security implications, the military of both countries should collaborate on disaster management and other shared concerns.Promoting peace and stabilityHistorically, Nepal's contributions to global peace have been celebrated, and our soft power has played a vital role in supporting these efforts. Nepali soldiers have participated in many global conflicts, including the World Wars, counter-insurgencies and counter-terrorism operations. They are primarily serving as peacekeepers in various challenging operational environments. In many ways, the armies of Nepal and India can learn from each other’s experiences.India places immense trust in Nepali youth in the military, particularly the Gurkha soldiers, who have been integral to the Indian Army since colonial times. The strength of this bond is evident in Gurkha soldiers’ participation in every Indian military campaign since India’s independence. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the Parliament of Nepal on August 3, 2014, said that Hindustan has got no victory in any war without the bloodshed of brave Gurkha soldiers. Similarly, a former Indian Ambassador to Nepal noted, \"The valour of Gurkha soldiers is deeply ingrained in the hearts and minds of the Indian people.\"Strategising military diplomacyJoint military exercises, like the Surya Kiran series (a joint military exercise) held regularly between Nepal and India, are essential to foster cooperation. These exercises develop professionalism, camaraderie and mutual respect between the two armies. Many officers and soldiers from the Nepali Army have benefited from high-quality training at Indian military institutions, forming lifelong bonds. As a graduate of the Indian Military Academy, the Defense Services Staff College, among others, this scribe has personally experienced their high standards of training and the mutual respect between all ranks of the two armies. Nepal continues to provide essential training for selected Indian military officers. Additionally, around 35,000 Nepali personnel currently serve in seven Gorkha regiments of the Indian Army, and over 120,000 pensioners reside in Nepal. These figures underscore the value of military diplomacy between the two countries.India’s growing prestige in the international community is undeniable, with its military ranked fifth globally, according to the Global Fire Power Index. The military-to-military relationship between India and Nepal transcends political and geographic boundaries, serving both nations' foreign policy objectives. The spectrum of military diplomacy is much more extensive. The regular visits of Indian military delegations to Kathmandu will strengthen the relationship between the two countries by creating new opportunities for cooperation.

While the war has led to immense suffering and a humanitarian crisis, it has also created unexpected economic opportunities for countries like India. The remarkable surge in India’s fuel exports to the European Union (EU) exemplifies how geopolitical tensions can yield economic gains for nations that skilfully navigate the shifting landscape. In the first three quarters of 2024, India’s exports of fuels such as diesel to the EU soared by an impressive 58 percent compared to the same period the previous year.Much of this increase can be traced to Indian refineries acquiring Russian crude oil at discounted prices, a direct consequence of the sanctions imposed by Western countries on Russia. As European nations increasingly turned away from Russian oil, India capitalised on the opportunity, positioning itself as the largest exporter of oil products to the EU. Before the invasion, Europe imported approximately 154,000 barrels per day (bpd) of diesel and jet fuel from India. Since the onset of the war, that figure has nearly doubled; highlighting India’s newly gained prominence in the global oil market.Refineries in Jamnagar, Vadinar and New Mangalore have ramped up their operations, relying heavily on Russian crude to meet this surging demand. This strategic manoeuvre has allowed India not only to enhance its foreign exchange reserves but also to play a pivotal role in the global oil supply chain during a time of crisis. The sanctions and price caps imposed by the G7 and EU aimed to limit Russia’s revenue from oil exports, a vital source of funding for its military operations. While these measures targeted crude oil directly, they inadvertently created a loophole: countries that did not participate in the sanctions could legally import Russian crude, refine it, and export the refined products to sanctioning nations.India has adeptly taken advantage of this situation, purchasing Russian crude at attractive discounts and re-exporting the refined products to Europe at full market prices. This scenario is a perfect illustration of a classic game theory concept known as “one’s loss is another’s gain.” In this geopolitical chess match, the West sought to weaken Russia’s economic power through sanctions, but in doing so, they unintentionally facilitated India’s economic ascent. By navigating the complexities of the energy market, India has not only filled the gap left by reduced Russian oil exports to Europe but has also reaped significant financial rewards. The financial implications for India are substantial. With crude oil forming a significant part of its imports, acquiring Russian oil at reduced prices has provided a crucial buffer for the country’s foreign exchange reserves.Recent data indicates that India purchased around 2 billion worth of Russian crude oil in October 2024 alone, making it the second-largest buyer after China, which accounted for approximately 47 percent of Russia’s crude exports. However, while these developments represent a remarkable economic opportunity, they also raise ethical questions amid the on-going humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. The Indian government has approached this situation with caution, emphasising the importance of energy security while balancing its international relationships. This pragmatic approach reflects a complex balancing act, weighing economic gains against the moral implications of engaging with a nation under widespread sanctions. As global pressure mounts on countries to isolate Russia, India finds itself in a precarious position.The rising foreign exchange reserves from fuel exports symbolise a critical opportunity for India to bolster its economy, but this also risks potential backlash from Western nations that view its actions through a lens of scepticism. India’s response to this geopolitical pressure will be crucial in maintaining its diplomatic relations while ensuring its energy needs are met. Looking ahead, the sustainability of India’s energy trade with Russia remains uncertain. The dynamics of the Ukraine conflict and the global energy market continue to evolve, influenced by geopolitical developments and changes in energy consumption patterns. As Europe seeks to diversify its energy sources and reduce reliance on Russian imports, India must adapt its strategies to maintain its newfound role in the global energy market.Moreover, as G7 nations and the EU continue to refine their sanctions on Russian oil products, India may face increased scrutiny regarding its role in refining and exporting Russian crude. Its ability to maintain its position as a key supplier to Europe will depend not only on diplomatic efforts but also on the adaptability of its energy strategies in a rapidly changing global landscape. In summary, the war in Ukraine has created a paradox: while it has inflicted suffering and turmoil, it has also opened avenues for economic growth for nations like India.As India navigates this complex landscape, it must balance economic benefits with ethical considerations, establishing itself as a responsible global player. The interplay of game theory, economic gain, and moral responsibility will shape India’s role in the global energy market for years to come.

The number of people with diabetes has doubled over the past 30 years, with over 800 million people worldwide now living with the condition, according to a new report by The Lancet. Like most non-communicable diseases, the prevalence of diabetes is particularly high in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In Nepal, 8.5 percent of the population is affected by this disease, and alarmingly, the infection rate continues to rise. Worse, poor countries also have younger people suffering from it, but they lack effective treatment, and the disease often goes unnoticed. By all accounts, diabetes has emerged as a growing public health crisis, calling for urgent measures to combat it.While the more developed countries have been able to reduce the number of diabetes patients over the years, the developing ones often fail to ensure even basic treatment facilities, which has prevented early detection and diagnosis of the disease. Even though diabetes is rooted in our poor lifestyle choices—lack of exercise, junk food, stressful work routines, and so on—the absence of easy access to treatment has exacerbated the problem. This has not only increased untreated patients in LMICs but also led to issues like kidney failure, loss of vision, stroke, heart attack, multi-organ failure, lower limb amputations, and, in the worst cases, premature death.Diabetes and its growing threat in low- and middle-income countries should serve as a wake-up call for governments. Investing in public health is the best intervention for the disease. Still, rather than increasing the budget in the health sector, Nepal is setting aside a meagre percentage (4.6 percent) of the total budget, affecting several healthcare programmes. Even though the country increased investment in health by 2.5 percent this year after facing criticisms for cutting it in the previous fiscal year, the amount falls short of providing patients with basic treatment services for early detection and timely intervention of diseases. The health ministry and authorities concerned should rethink their policies without further delay.The need for behavioural change on the part of the general public cannot be ignored either. Educated and young people living in urban areas have resources and tools that allow them to come to terms with the dangers of diabetes, go for regular health check-ups and opt for healthy lifestyles.

","summary":"Diabetes, a chronic disease caused by high glucose levels in the blood, consistently figures as one of the ten leading causes of death globally. The number of people with diabetes has doubled over the past 30 years, with over 800 million people worldwide now living with the condition, according to a new report by The Lancet. Like most non-communicable diseases, the prevalence of diabetes is particularly high in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In Nepal, 8.5 percent of the population is affected by this disease, and alarmingly, the infection rate continues to rise. Worse, poor countries also have younger people suffering from it, but they lack effective treatment, and the disease often goes unnoticed. By all accounts, diabetes has emerged as a growing public health crisis, calling for urgent measures to combat it.While the more developed countries have been able to reduce the number of diabetes patients over the years, the developing ones often fail to ensure even basic treatment facilities, which has prevented early detection and diagnosis of the disease.

He has vowed to adopt blanket 60% tariffs on imports of Chinese goods as part of a package of “America First” trade measures. Beijing opposes those steps. The Republican president-elect also plans to hire several hawkish voices on China in senior roles, including Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state and Representative Mike Waltz as national security adviser.Biden has aimed to lower tensions with China, but Washington is incensed by a recent China-linked hack of the telephone communications of government and presidential campaign officials, and it is anxious about increasing pressure by Beijing on Taiwan and Chinese support for Russia.Taiwan President Lai Ching-te is planning to stop in the state of Hawaii and maybe Guam on a sensitive visit that is sure to anger Beijing in the coming weeks, Reuters reported on Friday.

And what will be its South Asia policy and by extension an outlook towards Nepal?Trumps’ ‘America First’ policy is seen as Washington’s possible drift towards isolationism but his South Asia policy could be guided by his closeness and personal bond with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Strengthening strategic ties between New Delhi and Washington and the evolution of Beijing-Washington ties are other factors to watch out, observers say.Former Foreign Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey said Nepal’s relations with the United States will remain unchanged irrespective of who enters the White House—a Republican or a Democrat.Nepal and the United States forged diplomatic relations on April 25, 1947, becoming only the second country to do so after the UK. Nepal established its embassy in Washington DC on February 3, 1958, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On August 6, 1959, the American Embassy in Kathmandu was set up. A number of Nepal’s honorary consuls are stationed in various US cities and a large number of Nepali nationals now live and work in the country.A Republican occupied the White House when Nepal and the US established diplomatic relations, said Pandey. Also, when Nepal opened its embassy in Washington DC and the US did so in Kathmandu, a Republican was at the helm. “When King Mahendra addressed the joint session of US Congress in 1960, a Republican president was in power. Later, when he travelled to the United States in 1967, a Democratic president governed the country. Then, when King Birendra paid a state visit to the US in 1983, there was a Republican president,” said Pandey. “This suggests that the US policy towards Nepal has been stable and smooth.”Though Nepal-US relations have been changing for the better, during Trump’s first presidency between January 20, 2017 and January 20, 2021, bilateral ties took a dip due to the controversy over accepting the Millennium Challenge Corporation’s $500 million grant.The MCC became controversial in Nepal and stirred up debates. After Washington’s repeated clarifications that MCC is not aligned with the US’s Indo-Pacific Strategy and introduction of the 12-point interpretive declaration, the US grant was ratified by the House of Representatives in February 2022. Nepal has also invested $197 million in the MCC projects.During Trump’s first term as president, the American request for Nepal to join the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and State Partnership Program also caused unease in Nepal. Successive governments have clarified that Nepal does not intend to join these two US initiatives.Nepal’s former permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva Sambhu Ram Simkhada hopes that relations between Nepal and the US will remain good in Trump’s second term.“But it is more important to see how relations between powerful countries evolve during Trump’s second term,” he said.In Trump’s first term, some of his decisions like withdrawing from the Paris climate pact, the World Health Organisation, ending US support for sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and blocking abortion rights had an impact on Nepal as well. Nepal is looking for compensation for the damages from adverse effects of climate change, which is triggered mainly by the greenhouse gases emitted by large industrial countries.Nepal must tread carefully, said Pandey, especially with the US citizens electing a decisive president who wants no delays in action. Like Simkhada, former minister Pandey also believes that evolving ties between the US, India and China will shape Washington’s policy towards Kathmandu.Nepal is on the strategic radars of India, China and the US, said Pandey. “Therefore, it should be careful while navigating its relations with these three powers. Nepal should maintain healthy relations with both India and China.”Nepal should not be tempted to use its ties with one neighbour against the other, Pandey added.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has yet to issue a congratulatory message on Trump’s election but President Ramchandra Paudel and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli have congratulated the president-elect.In his congratulatory message on Wednesday, Paudel expressed confidence that the Nepal-US relationship would be further strengthened during Trump’s second term.Prime Minister Oli on Thursday stated that Trump’s return to the Oval Office is a historic chapter in American history.

Karki served as Nepal’s ambassador to the United States during Trump’s first term. “But yes, some global policies he pursues might impact Nepal.”“In his first term, Trump cut or downsized the US funds in areas like climate change, access to the abortion rights, health, and financial assistance to the World Health Organization.

Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement.

Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement.

So, Oli’s planned visit to Beijing isn’t a breach of any protocol; rather, it could set a precedent.Yet questions have lingered over why Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hasn’t extended an invitation to Oli, sparking speculation that Oli began planning a trip to China after waiting in vain for an invite from New Delhi. In some circles, there is a belief that Oli’s ascension to power is not to India’s liking. Some within Oli’s orbit have remarked that certain foreign powers have been trying to unseat the government without providing evidence to support this claim.Oli and India amid global shiftsEven Oli can’t deny that his past actions and rhetoric have frequently irked New Delhi.

Since the 2022 elections, he’s worn many hats: Coalition partner, opposition leader, and now, once again, prime minister.Yet India appears unconvinced. While Modi’s government rolled out the red carpet for Arzu Rana Deuba of the Nepali Congress, who serves as foreign minister in Oli’s Cabinet, it has yet to extend an invitation to Oli, despite him being in office for over 100 days and even meeting Modi in New York in September. Meanwhile, Oli’s government has repeatedly signalled its keenness to host Modi in Nepal, failing to elicit any concrete response.Then, has India abandoned its long-standing tradition of hosting the Nepali prime minister soon after a new government is formed? If so, this raises broader questions about India’s much-touted “Neighborhood First” policy. Extending an invitation to Oli could have shown goodwill and reinforced New Delhi’s proclamation that “Nepal is a special priority partner.”Amid rapid geopolitical shifts, India may have set its sights on bigger platforms and larger roles in the world order, but it would do well not to ignore its neighbours or treat them based on the government of the day. On Nepal’s part, its foreign policy is becoming increasingly complex, extending beyond bilateral ties with India and China, as Sino-Indian and Sino-American tensions and interests intersect more with a growing US influence in Asia amid shifting global dynamics.

Oli is no exception. Even before an official invitation was extended, extensive media reports outlined Oli’s potential agenda for the trip, including efforts to secure a loan waiver for the Pokhara International Airport and agreements on some Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects. The Chinese, who often practise quiet diplomacy, have yet to comment on Oli's planned visit. Meanwhile, the BRI remains a contentious issue in Nepal, with Beijing eager to reframe all China-funded projects under its banner. Oli currently leads a strong government with support from the Nepali Congress, the largest party in Parliament. Congress’s position on the BRI and other forms of assistance is clear—grants are acceptable but loans are not. If Oli avoids pushing too aggressively with China, potentially unsettling his coalition partner, his position remains secure.

It’s up to Nepali leaders—especially Oli—to negotiate beneficial terms.The Nepali public is divided on Chinese aid: Some see it as a counterbalance to dependence on India, while others fear it might lead to undue influence from the north.

According to multiple leaders privy to the development, by electing a Congress lawmaker as deputy speaker, Oli wanted to strengthen relations with the major coalition partner Congress, which has more seats than the prime minister’s party, the CPN-UML, in the House of Representatives. Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba has a special interest in getting a lawmaker from his party elected to the post, as deputy speaker is an ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council, which nominates members and heads of constitutional bodies.The prime minister on September 9 convened a meeting of the ruling parties and floated a proposal to remove Deputy Speaker Magar and sought a green signal from the coalition partners to his plan.After the meeting, party leaders told the Post that Prime Minister Oli proposed removing Deputy Speaker Magar from her position, citing conduct unbecoming of her office. Deputy Speaker Magar courted controversy after it emerged that she had requested visa interview dates from the US Embassy for individuals unrelated to her official role. On February 26 last year, Magar wrote to the US Embassy in Kathmandu requesting a visa interview for herself and five others. Two months later, the letter was leaked, and she was under pressure to step down.Last month, the prime minister held several meetings and consultations with a plan to introduce an ordinance to amend the Political Parties Act-2017 with an intention to facilitate party splits. This plan also drew widespread criticism as leaders from various political parties and independent observers accused the prime minister of plotting splits of fringe political parties with a plan to merge their dissident groups into the UML.His proposal to introduce ordinance was reportedly floated in order to merge the Ashok-Rai led Janata Socialist Party and the dissident group from the Madhav Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist), which in turn would make the UML the largest party in the House of Representatives.As the major coalition partner, the Congress, reportedly did not back his proposal to introduce the ordinance, Oli was again pushed to the back seat.These are just a few cases in point. Oli from the start of this tenure has struggled to assert his authority.Professor of political science Krishna Pokharel assesses that there may have been an understanding between Congress President Deuba and Prime Minister Oli to arrest Rastriya Swatantra Party President Rabi Lamichhane, who was accused of misappropriating cooperative funds, and issuing an ordinance related to political parties.Pokharel believes that the two leaders might have reached a deal to accomplish the two goals—bring an ordinance to facilitate the split of the CPN (Unified Socialist), which was formed in 2021 after breaking away from the UML; and arrest Lamichhane. Lamichhane, the immediate past home minister, had reportedly tried to arrest Congress chief Deuba’s spouse (current foreign minister) Arzu Rana Deuba, on charges of involvement in the Bhutanese refugee scam. “While the wish of the Congress chief was fulfilled, the interest of the UML chair and the prime minister was not,” Pokharel said. However, the UML leaders don’t buy this argument. Vice-chair Yubaraj Gyawali said that the government under UML leadership has just completed its 100 days, so it is too early to judge its performance. “There are many good initiatives taken by this government whose results will come in due course,” Gyawali told the Post. “Everything that the head of the government wants cannot be achieved in such a short period, but that does not mean his influence has waned.” But some political analysts say that Oli’s standing has declined since he became prime minister this time with the support of Congress, the largest party in Parliament. Oli dismisses those who claim his influence has gone down. While addressing the symposium on ‘Role of former security personnel in National Security and Development’ organised by the Nepal National Former Army and Police Association on October 27, Oli rubbished claims that his influence was steadily decreasing.“Those who claim my charm has decreased will know the reality in the 2027 election,” Oli said.Sarita Bhusal, a UML lawmaker, said a mistaken impression might have been created among the people. “Sometimes there are constraints to leading a coalition government,” Bhusal told the Post.Gyawali, a vice chair of the UML, agrees. “Earlier, Oli became prime minister with the support of smaller parties. But this time, he has the backing of the largest party in Parliament, so it is not easy for him to do all that he wants.” Oli first headed a coalition government after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. When he became prime minister again in 2018 after the 2017 election, his party was the largest in the House. He became prime minister with the support of the Maoist Centre, which was his coalition partner during his previous stint as well.The Congress publicity department head, Min Bahadur Bishwakarma, said his party has been giving full support to the Oli government. “Our party has not opposed any government programme that is good for the country,” Bishwakarma told the Post. “We only caution the government on issues that may cause public backlash.”This government was formed in the spirit of a seven-point agreement between the two parties, and achieving those objectives must be its primary focus, Bishawakarma said. Of late, Oli has also faced criticism from within his party. Some UML leaders publicly opposed his recent decision to accept a donation from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of Bhatbhateni Supermarket, for the construction of the party’s head office. Experts see it as a sign of his decreasing hold in the party organisation. Although party’s standing committee member Binda Pandey and central committee member Ushakiran Timilsina protested against it publicly, other party leaders are also reportedly dissatisfied with Oli’s decision.Bhim Rawal, who contested the election for chair against Oli during the party’s 10th general convention in Chitwan in November 2021, also criticised Oli for accepting the donation. Sidelined by Oli, Rawal is currently inactive in the party. Even leaders like Gokul Baskota, who used to be a staunch Oli supporter, couldn’t back him on the deal with businessman Gurung.In an interview with Image television, Baskota said, “The UML cannot accept Gurung’s donation and carry his old baggage.” On October 28, the Supreme Court issued an interlocutory interim order barring the ruling party, UML, from building any structure on the land donated by businessman Gurung. A single bench of Justice Sunil Kumar Pokharel said the UML-Gurung donation deal was illegal prima facie, putting Oli further on the defensive.

In that case, they might have featured Jung Chang's early childhood as an example: Born in 1952, three years after Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China, Chang enjoyed a quality free education, public canteen meals, and a comfortable apartment. She idolised Chairman Zedong for these blessings and felt fortunate to avoid the hardships of capitalism.This starkly contrasts with the woman Chang would grow up to be. Her memoir, ‘Wild Swans’, is largely the story of her own disillusionment. By the end of its 650 pages, she feels disgusted for Zedong and the regime she grew up under. The book still cannot be published in China.A fairytale gone waryThough much of ‘Wild Swans’ focuses on Jung Chang’s life under Mao’s rule, the story begins decades before her birth, as reflected in its subtitle, ‘Three Daughters of China’. It opens with the life of Chang’s grandmother, who grew up in the Manchurian Empire, now northern China. Within the first 100 pages, a complex series of events unravels for her family and the region. The narrative follows her grandmother's life, including the moment her father gives her away as a concubine to a warlord.As a teenager, Chang’s grandmother is confined to a house, waiting years before her husband visits her for the first time—a visit that leaves her pregnant. After giving birth to Chang's mother, the grandmother gains freedom when the warlord dies. Chang's mother grew up under Japanese occupation, only to witness her province engulfed in the decades-long civil war between the Kuomintang and the communists. At 15, she aligns herself with the communists, joining the underground movement. Following their victory, she meets Chang’s father, a celebrated communist officer. Despite early suspicion from the Party, the family enjoys prosperous years ahead, with Chang’s parents rising to prominence and her childhood resembling a picture-perfect life.The communist dream began to crack in 1959 when disastrous agricultural policies triggered the Great Famine, which is now estimated to have claimed around 30 million lives. This devastating event plants the first seeds of doubt in the minds of Chang’s parents, who had been loyal Party members until then. Chang’s sheltered life is completely upended when Mao launches the Cultural Revolution, a period marked by violent purges. Her parents, especially her father, fall from grace, joining thousands of disgraced officials nationwide. The family is torn apart, with both parents imprisoned. During these turbulent years, Chang works on farms, in factories, and at a doctor's office. The toll on her family is immense: her grandmother and many relatives perish, and her father, broken by years of physical and psychological abuse, dies of a heart attack after the worst has passed. In 1978, Chang left China on an academic scholarship and moved to London, where she transformed her memories into her memoir, ‘Wild Swans’.Personal—at times too personal‘Wild Swans’ greatest strength is also its greatest weakness: It is a personal account. The book is most fascinating and insightful when it delves into Chang's experiences. Her depiction of being indoctrinated into Mao’s near-divine status—and her immense struggle to break free from that mindset, even as her parents endure horrific suffering—is particularly gripping. Chang’s portrayal of her parents’ relationship is equally compelling. Her father, more potent within the Party and idealistic than her mother, creates a dynamic that leads to marital tensions. Chang vividly brings their characters and struggles to life, with the narrative reflecting her deep love and understanding of both perspectives.Chang’s deep love and admiration for her family can sometimes feel excessive. In sections where ‘Wild Swans’ shifts from firsthand experiences to recounting the lives and thoughts of her ancestors, Chang often adopts the tone of a devoted descendant eager to present her lineage as morally flawless. This can make some scenes feel less believable, such as the account of her mother’s teenage imprisonment by Kuomintang soldiers, where she is portrayed as entirely fearless and unyielding. As revealed in the afterword, much of the pre-Chang narrative is based on stories her mother shared during a visit to London in the 1980s. However, the book does not acknowledge this as a recollection filtered through time and memory, which it arguably should. This lack of context makes parts of the narrative feel overly polished and detached from the inherent subjectivity of oral history.The first part of ‘Wild Swans’, covering the period before Chang's birth, is by far the book's weakest section. These initial 200 pages could have been significantly condensed to around 50, as they often feel overly drawn out. Alternatively, the tone of admiration could have been tempered or presented with greater context to provide a more balanced perspective. This adjustment would have made the narrative more grounded and engaging.Real-life ‘1984’While Chang’s family history is undoubtedly remarkable, some judicious editing would have enhanced the book overall. Many details are highly entertaining, such as the anecdote about the Communist Party’s decision that red could not signal “stop” because it was anti-revolutionary, leading to traffic chaos until the policy was reversed. However, other elements—such as lengthy, repetitive descriptions of vegetation—could have been trimmed without detracting from the experience, particularly for readers with only a casual interest in botany.Overall, ‘Wild Swans’ is an impressive achievement, with the flaw that it was probably written from a place of too much love. Although it can be annoying at times, it is recommended for anyone who wants a crash course in Chinese history without having to pick up a real textbook—or for anybody who wants to know the effects of a real-world ‘1984’ on the minds of real people.Wild SwansAuthor: Jung ChangPublisher: Harper CollinsYear: 1991 ","summary":"Suppose the Chinese Communist Party had aired TV commercials in the 1950s.

In July last year, a delegation of seven chief ministers had presented their demands that ranged from deployment of civil servants, promulgation of laws, and revenue sharing.“We jointly called for implementing the 17-point demand, most of which remain unimplemented,” Satish Kumar Singh, Madhesh chief minister, told the Post. Their key and longstanding demands include adjustment of Nepal Police in provincial police and promulgation of the Federal Civil Service Act. Although maintaining law and order falls under the exclusive authority of the provinces, successive federal governments have delayed the adjustment of the police. Other demands include transferring ownership of land and buildings being used by provincial entities to the respective provinces, and deployment and transfer of the officials in coordination with the provinces. Provinces have been complaining that frequent unconsulted transfers of principal secretaries, secretaries and other staff adversely affect their performance.They have been demanding that an arrangement should be made whereby the federal government sends secretaries at the provincial ministries and chief administrative officers at the local units, with the provinces retaining the ultimate authority to assign them duties. Currently, the federal government deploys them directly.“The provinces are facing unprecedented burdens from natural disasters. We have demanded proper support and response from the federal level,” said Singh. Promulgation of the remaining federal laws to delegate the exclusive and concurrent authorities to the provinces, as well as amendments to existing laws to ease land acquisition for development projects and establish industrial areas, are the other demands of provincial governments. They also asked for amendment to the Local Government Operations Act to ease revenue sharing from river-based resources between local and provincial governments, and revisions to the Forest Act to allow them to use national forests. The Madhesh government has even filed a writ in the Supreme Court demanding authority over forest management, but the case has been pending for years. Likewise, repeal of the Urban Area Public Transport (Management) Authority Act-2022, to enable provinces to collect revenues from traffic rules violation, is another demand. During Friday’s meeting, the chief ministers also expressed frustration over delays in obtaining clearance from the forest ministry, which they said hinder development efforts. In response, Oli said he too was concerned about the delays in development works due to lack of permit in the use of forest covered areas. “Forest-related agencies should facilitate development efforts while also working to protect forests and environment,” said Oli. “They are not expected to create barriers in development efforts.” Addressing the meeting, the prime minister claimed that running an effective, competent and transparent administration while also addressing the public grievances was the top priority of his government.“We must work with determination and make bold decisions. Modernisation of agriculture and encouraging the private sector are essential to increase production and productivity. Actions that intimidate or insult entrepreneurs, or those that reward negative tendencies, must be strictly discouraged,” said Oli. “We need to create an environment conducive to investment in trade and industry.” ","summary":"The seven chief ministers have together called on the federal government to implement the 17-point charter of demands they presented last year.Expressing their concerns at the meeting of the National Development Problem Solving Committee led by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, they said fulfilling the demands was a must for the provinces’ effective functioning.

However, after failing to receive an invitation from India for several weeks, the prime minister went to New York to attend the 79th session of the UN General Assembly where he met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, and several other world leaders.“I went to the US to attend the UN General Assembly because the UN is [headquartered] in the US, where I met several world leaders, but it does not mean that I wanted to visit the US first,” said Oli, adding, “We are surrounded by two great neighbours and we have to maintain good relations with them.”“And my visit to China will not damage our relations with India. Our relations with India are deep, historical, based on culture and tradition, and predate the formation of modern states. We are sovereign nations and make foreign trips as per our convenience,” said Oli.Oli was speaking at the Kantipur Conclave’s concluding session moderated by Kantipur Editor-in-Chief Umesh Chauhan on Thursday.During the interaction, Oli discussed a range of domestic issues including the country's economy, national politics, issue of constitution amendment, relations between the federal and provincial governments, and the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chairman and former deputy prime minister Rabi Lamichhane, among other things. Responding to the ongoing street protests by Rastriya Swatantra Party supporters opposing the arrest of their party chief, and the calls by some groups calling for the restoration of monarchy and dissolution of the current constitution, the prime minister said he is ready for any kind of open discussion on these issues. He said he welcomes dialogues on the future of the political system, but won’t allow the constituion to be torn down.Oli also defended the progress made over the last three decades (since the restoration of democracy in 1990), highlighting significant strides in infrastructure. “Road networks have now reached 98 percent of the country.” On the arrest of Lamichhane, who is in police custody on charges of cooperatives fraud, the prime minister stated that he cannot protect Lamichhane if he had committed wrongdoings.\"The court will look into his case…if someone makes mistakes and blames others, it is unacceptable,\" said Oli. Oli also gave some background on how he had helped Lamichhane and hired him as a television anchor when he was jobless. “I gave him the job, and he later joined politics,” said Oli, adding that he would not tolerate corruption.I favoured him, but I never thought that Rabi was involved in cooperative scam,” said Oli, and claimed that he was initially against forming the parliamentary probe, but Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Lamichhane himself requested such a probe. Rastriya Swatantra Party’s protests and demonstrations “aimed at pressuring the court” are unacceptable, Oli said, adding, “Let the law take its course.”The prime minister also dismissed the allegations that the government was working on a new law on political parties to facilitate party splits. “There is a void so we have to bring a new law,” he said, adding “The UML does not need to be the largest party to claim the premiership.” It is believed that the government wants to make party splits easier, because the UML wants to merge dissident groups in a few parties including the CPN (Unified Socialist) and the Janata Samajbadi Party into its fold.Speaking at the conclave, the prime minister said the government will bring laws to support provincial governments.“We will review the constitution.

Does Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli fit the same mould as Modi and Trump?Indian political scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta, for one, does not think so. Mehta said Indian Prime Minister Modi and newly elected American President Donald Trump were ‘populist’ leaders, but he declined to give the same tag to Oli, the chair of CPN-UML.Answering a question about Oli’s ‘populist tendencies’, Mehta replied, “As I don’t see radical anti-elitism in Nepal, and the political leaders are comfortably maintaining the status quo around the elite structure, there is no populist leader in the present power structure of Nepal,” Mehta said.Mehta was speaking at a session titled ‘The Wave of Populism’ hosted by the Post’s Editor Biswas Baral in the Kantipur Conclave in Kathmandu on Wednesday. Mehta also claimed that with the election of Donald Trump as the US President, world politics might see the absence of norms. Trump, who was first elected President in 2016, has been accused of serving an ‘unpresidented’ term and many liberal journalists and public intellectuals around the world have expressed fear over what the businessman-politician’s second term would unleash.Trump has been accused of leading a racist campaign in the lead-up to the election; and Mehta said that it is one of the hallmarks of populism.“Feature of a certain kind of populism is to actually say that the nation has a kind of singular nationality and it should primarily be dominated by one particular group,” Mehta said.“Radical elements of anti-elitism” are the second feature of populism, Mehta added, whereas the prevalence of ethno-identity politics is the other feature.Indian Prime Minister Modi, who is trying to construct the singular ethno-national consciousness in the name of religion, is a populist leader, Mehta argued.Modi, a leader of Bharatiya Janata Party, has been ruling India for over 10 years after being elected as prime minister in 2014.Mehta said that while Modi has tried to mobilise the ethno-national identity to garner votes, the same strategy has not been used in Nepal.He also believes that instead of criticising populist leaders, traditional political parties should offer something other than the status quo to convince the public of their agenda. Mehta said that none of the world’s populist leaders have prioritised solving economic challenges.He cited examples of election strategies in both India and America, observing that “populist leaders do not prioritise economic challenges as campaign issues.” Mehta, however, said that some Latin American populist leaders have raised economic reform as part of their agendas.He explained that leaders like Modi in India and Trump in America often depict traditional structures as their adversaries. “In India, Modi portrays nepotism as one such adversarial structure,” Mehta said. ","summary":"Over the past decade or so, ‘populism’ has become a popular byword among academics globally to describe the complexities of world politics, especially after the rise of authoritarian leaders like Narendra Modi in India and Donald Trump in the United States. Does Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli fit the same mould as Modi and Trump?Indian political scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta, for one, does not think so. Mehta said Indian Prime Minister Modi and newly elected American President Donald Trump were ‘populist’ leaders, but he declined to give the same tag to Oli, the chair of CPN-UML.Answering a question about Oli’s ‘populist tendencies’, Mehta replied, “As I don’t see radical anti-elitism in Nepal, and the political leaders are comfortably maintaining the status quo around the elite structure, there is no populist leader in the present power structure of Nepal,” Mehta said.Mehta was speaking at a session titled ‘The Wave of Populism’ hosted by the Post’s Editor Biswas Baral in the Kantipur Conclave in Kathmandu on Wednesday.

The plane landed in Bhairahawa at 12:28 pm, after which Lamichhane was taken directly to the office of district attorney, according to Rupandehi district police.The office of the district attorney started recording Lamichhane’s statement at 1pm. District attorney Premraj Paudel and his team interrogated the RSP chief about his alleged involvement in cooperative fraud, organised crime, and money laundering. According to sources, Lamichhane denied involvement in the cooperative scam, claiming that he was unaware of deposits made in his name.Paudel said that the office of the district attorney would continue recording Lamichhane’s statement from 10am on Wednesday. According to him, around 20 questions were asked to Lamichhane on Tuesday, but his statement has yet to be transcribed.Talking briefly to the reporters while emerging from the office of the district attorney, Lamichhane said that “caging a tiger doesn’t turn it into a jackal,” implying that he remains unshaken.The former deputy prime minister is currently held in Kaski police custody on charges of cooperative fraud, organised crime, and money laundering. On Sunday, the Kaski District Court extended his detention by 13 days for further investigation.Previously, the Rupandehi District Court issued arrest warrants for 12 individuals, including Lamichhane and GB Rai, on October 24. The two are accused of misappropriating Rs142.9 million from Supreme Cooperative and diverting it to Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd. Investigations indicate that Lamichhane had borrowed Rs19.6 million in personal loans from the cooperative.Further probes revealed that Gorkha Media Network’s vice chairman, Chhabilal Joshi Banjade, took an additional Rs24.5 million loan, which was transferred to Gorkha Media’s Global IME Bank account. Records show Supreme Cooperative’s manager, Sagar KC, authorised a loan voucher for Lamichhane, with Roshani Gurung allegedly moving funds into Gorkha Media’s account. Roshani has since been released on bail, while the cooperative’s chairman Om Prakash Gurung remains in custody.An investigation into Supreme Cooperative revealed Rs780 million of members’ deposits had been diverted to other organisations. Authorities believe over 32 individuals, including former chairman GB Rai, former secretary Dipesh Pun, and KC, were involved in the embezzlement, with 25 still at large.In January, police issued a red notice for GB Rai, who is still at large.

In the first phase, emissions of petrol and diesel vehicles operating in the metropolis will be randomly tested, and the city office has also planned to carry out emission testing for motorcycles.Emission testing will be carried out on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the Department of Transport Management and received green stickers. Officials say that vehicles with green stickers could still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.“We have seen many vehicles with green stickers emitting black smoke,” an official at the Environment Department of the KMC said, asking not to be named as the official is not authorised to talk to the media. “Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing.” Officials say that the amount of the fine will be determined based on the suggestions of stakeholders.Vehicle emission testing is among the measures the city office has been taking to reduce pollution levels in the metropolis.The KMC has also started independently monitoring the city's air quality, with support from the Partnership for Healthy Cities, which has provided 19 portable devices to the city office.The Partnership for Healthy Cities is a global network of 74 cities, including the Kathmandu metropolis, committed to saving lives by preventing noncommunicable diseases and injuries. The programme is supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies in partnership with the World Health Organisation and Vital Strategies.Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year during winter and summer, and the capital city often ranks as the world’s most polluted metropolis. Major hospitals also report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Doctors warn that people get sick from respiratory illnesses caused by polluted air throughout the year, due to polluted air.Doctors say air pollution is known to cause various respiratory illnesses. Poor air quality can cause short- and long-term effects on public health. In the short term, it can lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems, and in the long run it can lead to severe conditions like ulcers, and cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, and heart complications.People in low- and middle-income countries get disproportionately affected by the polluted air, which accounts for more than 90 percent of deaths, according to the World Health Organisation.Several studies carried out in the past in Nepal show that toxic air takes a huge toll on public health. Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke, according to experts.The report, titled “Global burden and strength of evidence for 88 risk factors in 204 countries and 811 subnational locations, 1990–2021: A systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021,” finds that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent). The report was published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively, according to the report.Environment experts in Nepal often point out that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development of the country.

Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke, according to experts.The report, titled “Global burden and strength of evidence for 88 risk factors in 204 countries and 811 subnational locations, 1990–2021: A systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021,” finds that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent). The report was published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively, according to the report.Environment experts in Nepal often point out that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development of the country.

They emphasised that increased collaboration would strengthen inter-linkages between the economies, benefiting all stakeholders involved.Subsequently, a tripartite power sales agreement between NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam, NEA and Bangladesh Power Development Board was signed on October 3 in Kathmandu.Nepal will transmit the energy to India through the 400KV Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur cross-border transmission line before India transmits the equivalent to Bangladesh.

But there has been no response,” a top official of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies told the Post on condition of anonymity.According to the Cement Manufacturers’ Association of Nepal, a dozen Nepali cement factories applied for BIS certification in 2022 to make their products eligible for export, particularly to India. According to the manufacturers the Post spoke to, the certification should be issued two months after the manufacturers' applications are processed. But none of them have been able to get it.Export of Nepali cements has been stalled time and again over BIS-related issues.“The issues started with cement, and since then, Indian authorities have expanded restrictions to include many other goods like Goldstar shoes. They have halted exports of all products. There has been no development on the issues to date,” said the official.The Post’s attempts to get a comment from the Indian Embassy in Nepal were unsuccessful.In 2020, the Indian government asked the BIS to prescribe mandatory standards for imported goods in line with international quality norms. The move aimed to prevent Chinese goods from entering India through neighbouring countries.After banning Chinese apps, the Indian government imposed import restrictions on more than 370 Chinese products.Insiders say India does not want any products from Nepal with Chinese components, including Nepal’s hydroelectricity, which is greatly worrying top Nepali exporters.India is Nepal’s largest export destination. The country exported goods worth Rs103.18 billion in the last fiscal year, which ended in mid-July. Similarly, Nepal’s imports from India are massive, amounting to Rs996.68 billion, out of the country’s total imports of Rs1.59 trillion.Nepal majorly exported zinc sheets, shoes and sandals, textiles, tea, polyester yarn, jute goods (hessian and sacking), and fruit juice.According to Nepali authorities, they have been closely watching the issue in other southeast Asian countries.They say Vietnam is also a victim of India’s new rule curbing Chinese components in exports.According to media reports, in May, Vietnam's trade ministry wrote to New Delhi to expedite BIS certification for 26 companies, stating that the delays are hurting business. Most of these companies are engaged in the trade of shoes or steel.The reports say that manufacturers from other countries, especially Chinese companies, are also facing delays in securing BIS certification. In Nepal, domestic manufacturers of sanitary pads and diapers, footwear, cement, and plywood said that despite completing all the processes to obtain a BIS certificate to export their products months ago, they have not been able to get it.Nepal has raised the issue many times with India and even the domestic private sector communicated directly with the BIS, but the Indian side has not responded.The producers said despite completing lab tests and paying fees for BIS certification, no team from India has visited to inspect their factories.According to The Indian Express, India’s Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal stated on October 16 that quality control orders (QCOs) restricting the import and sale of substandard items in the country have been extended to 732 products to align with international standards and boost exports.“QCOs are a key mechanism through which India is not only raising quality standards to enter the global value chain but also restricting imports from China,” according to the media reports. “Imports from China have already crossed $60 billion during the first seven months of 2024, which is 10 percent higher than the $55 billion recorded during the same period last year.”Goyal stated that, until 2014, only 14 QCOs were covering 106 products. However, in the past 10 years, the government has issued 174 such orders, now covering 732 products.Insiders from Nepal’s private sector trade body said India stopped Bangladeshi goods, citing the BIS certification requirement. When Bangladesh threatened a reciprocal action, India promptly issued the BIS certificate.“We even wrote to the Indian authority multiple times, but our requests have fallen on deaf ears,” Dol Raj Adhikari, president of the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, told the Post in a recent interview.As per the provision, once the Indian inspection team gives a green signal after factory inspection, goods can be exported to India.The BIS deals with the marking and certifying goods, incorporating quality standards and information on international norms to be followed while importing.According to the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, Rs250 million worth of sanitary pads and diapers has been stranded in the warehouses for the past three months.Likewise, a big consignment of Goldstar shoes failed to get export clearance after India refused to issue the BIS certificate, putting Nepal’s homegrown shoemaker on the brink.Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months. Cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity.India even stopped importing plywood from Nepal due to the BIS issue, but later, it provided certification-free exports until March 2025.Plywood manufacturers said that India is not renewing their quality certificate or providing a BIS certificate even after completing the process in June.Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geotextiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.The private sector said that the BIS certificate issue has put the industries in Rupandehi in a big dilemma.

They were registered on February 23, 2020.The 15th Joint Commission meeting of the European Union held in Kathmandu on March 19 this year underlined that air safety remains a key priority in their bilateral relations.In 2022, in its final audit report, the United Nations aviation watchdog ICAO formally asked Nepal to split the civil aviation body into two entities.Several aviation watchdogs, experts, and diplomatic agencies have urged Nepal to strengthen its independent regulatory body to ensure safer skies.The government first announced the proposal in its Three Year Interim Plan (2007-08 to 2009-10), which stated, “In the context of the completion of the study on the institutional strengthening of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), which has been working as the service provider in civil aviation, airport operator and regulator; implementation of doable recommendations suggested by the report is being considered.”Since then, every periodic plan and policy, including the annual budget, has prioritised separating the civil aviation body. But the plan has yet to be implemented.

Though the patient was unaware of his diabetic problem, tests showed dangerously high blood glucose levels—fasting blood glucose 270, post-meal 340, and HBA1C level 10.7.Doctors say a healthy person's fasting blood glucose level should be less than 100 mg/dl, post-meal blood sugar level below 140 mg/dl, and HBA1c level below 5.7 percent. “We have to carry out multiple tests to know if the high blood glucose has affected the vital organs—kidney, eyes, blood vessels and others,” said Dr Dipak Malla, assistant professor at the National Academy of Medical Sciences. “These types of patients, from remote villages, who have been suffering from high blood pressure but are unaware of it, often visit our hospital.”Diabetes, a chronic disease, occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin (a hormone that regulates blood glucose) or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. The problem has been emerging as a major public health problem in Nepal. A study carried out in 2020 shows that 8.5 percent of the population, or two million people, have been suffering from diabetic problems. The alarming rise in diabetic patients is a global problem, but in low and middle-income countries like Nepal, the disease has drastically increased, with 450 million adults aged 30 and over with diabetes globally (59 percent) who did not receive treatment in 2022, according to a new report.The report titled “Over 800 million adults living with diabetes, more than half not receiving treatment, global study suggests”, which appeared in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal, on Wednesday, showed that the global rate of diabetes (type 1 and 2 combined) in adults doubled from approximately 7 percent to about 14 percent between 1990 and 2022, with the largest increase in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).Of the 828 million adults with diabetes in 2022, over a quarter (212 million) lived in India with another 148 million in China, followed by the USA (42 million), Pakistan (36 million), Indonesia (25 million) and Brazil (22 million).People living in North America, Australasia, central and Western Europe, andparts of Latin America and East Asia, and the Pacific saw a significant improvement in treatment rates for diabetes from 1990 to 2022, contributing to widening global inequities in diabetes treatment.“Our study highlights widening global inequalities in diabetes, with treatment rates stagnating in many low- and middle-income countries where numbers of adults with diabetes are drastically increasing,” said professor Majid Ezzati, of Imperial College London, a senior author of the report.“This is especially concerning as people with diabetes tend to be younger in low-income countries and, in the absence of effective treatment, are at risk of life-long complications—including amputation, heart disease, kidney damage or vision loss—or in some cases, premature death.”Obesity and poor diet are important drivers of the rise in type 2 diabetes rates and their variation across countries. Diabetes rates were either already high or increased more in some of the regions where obesity was or became prevalent between 1990 and 2022. This was compared to many high-income countries, especially those in the Pacific and western Europe, where, in general, obesity and diabetes rates did not rise or rose by a relatively small amount.The study highlights the urgent need for financing of medicines and comprehensive diabetes programmes that enable early detection and effective treatment of diabetes in LMICs.Experts and endocrinologists in Nepal also said that diabetes problems could be far more than what is estimated. What concerns them much is that even young people suffer from high blood sugar.“Young people in their mid 20’s and early 30’s are also suffering from diabetic problems,” said Dr Jyoti Bhattarai Kunwar, a senior endocrinologist. “Many patients do not have easy access to proper treatment. When patients do not get access to proper treatment, problems will not be diagnosed on time. Detection of diabetes must be an urgent priority.”Doctors say that patients could suffer from major health problems—blindness, kidney failure, heart attack, stroke, multi-organ failure, and lower limb amputations if left with high blood sugar. One could think that diabetes is like any other health problem, but serious health problems start when one suffers from high blood glucose.“The number of patients suffering from high blood glucose has been raised alarmingly of late,” said Dr Ansu Mali Joshi, a senior endocrinologist. “A sedentary lifestyle, changing eating habits, and junk foods have been fuelling the problems.

A healthy diet, regular exercise, and stress-free life must be promoted to reduce the problems.” "},{"hash":"a82587942daa32ad9f77b86079b23b41e606dc1f6e834bcbeaa90c2da16a6b69","title":"japan-proposes-new-restrictions-on-over-the-counter-drugs-to-prevent-possible-abuse","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/health/2024/11/13/japan-proposes-new-restrictions-on-over-the-counter-drugs-to-prevent-possible-abuse","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/world/kousei7h5sroiig7jw7mqugqbbzxw6nqkiocrs50uav908f9c-1731474588.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1731456000000,"source":"kp","category":"health","content":"As some over-the-counter drugs are suspected of being abused by young people and others, the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry has compiled a draft plan to revise the rules on how the medications are displayed.Amid deepening concerns on health problems caused by drug abuse, and as a measure to prevent people from overdosing, the ministry aims to revise the law concerning pharmaceuticals and medical devices by the end of next year.Of the over-the-counter drugs, which are medications that can be purchased without a prescription, about 1,500 products that contain six types of substances that could be abused would be subject to the new rules.According to the draft plan, such drugs will be displayed in areas not readily accessible to customers or that are easily visible to pharmacists.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Diverse attractions in Nepal include Mundhum Trek, Janaki Mandir, Kuri Village, Annapurna Base Camp, Bardiya and Khaptad National Parks, and Limi Valley, offering cultural experiences, pilgrimage, scenic landscapes, trekking, and wildlife encounters."},{"hash":"c077b34beda2250a997231f215f178053a057340c5c72de0aec15b25ae40ddb7","title":"old-memories-and-new-realities-in-phidim","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/travel/2023/11/18/old-memories-and-new-realities-in-phidim","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2023/third-party/phidim%20main%20(1).JPG&w=900&height=601","date":1700265600000,"source":"kp","category":"travel","content":"Once again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift.

I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district.

It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities.

The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” ","summary":"Chaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade.

Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

There were, of course, a few honourable exceptions in both camps. By the 1990s, the situation began to change for the set of anthropologists of Nepal. Although new videshi anthropologists enrolled in universities in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, France, Australia and a few other countries continued to come to Nepal to research, the number of Nepali anthropologists also began to grow steadily. Many in the latter group were trained at Tribhuvan University (TU), where the joint anthropology and sociology department was founded in 1981. Some Nepali anthropologists were also trained in universities in the US, Europe, Japan and elsewhere. However, there has been no similar growth regarding the set of non-Nepali historians researching on Nepal. I can’t think of even five non-Nepali researchers who have completed their PhDs in history conducting research related to Nepal in the past 25 years. I am aware of Bernardo Michael (2001, University of Hawaii at Manoa) and Catherine Warner (2014, University of Washington). Both worked on themes related to sovereignty and the Indo-Nepal border. If we want to be generous, we can also add Rhoderick Chalmers to this group, who finished a dissertation in 2003 in a different department at SOAS, University of London, by analysing the formation of the Nepali public sphere in British India between 1914 and 1940. Similarly, Browen Bledsoe finished a dissertation in 2004 at the Department of South Asian Languages and Civilisations at the University of Chicago, working on the inscriptions of the Kathmandu Valley. There must be a few other foreign colleagues who have done doctoral work related to the histories of Nepal in the past 25 years from departments in Indology or literature. There are several reasons why very few non-Nepalis have done history PhDs on themes related to Nepal. The primary reason is related to the structuring of the job market in the field of South Asian history outside of the region itself. While many scholars might be intellectually attracted to doing historical research on Nepal, they soon realise that it is very difficult to obtain academic jobs in the field of history having done doctoral research on Nepal since preference for such jobs is given to folks who have done research on colonial or medieval/ancient India. Take for example the case of the British historian of modern Nepal, John Whelpton. He finished his PhD in history at SOAS, University of London, in 1987. His doctoral research focused on the political history of Nepal between the years 1830 and 1857. In particular, he studied the rise of Jung Bahadur Rana as the national dada. However, even before he finished his PhD, Whelpton had already figured out that getting a regular job as an academic teaching South Asian history would be difficult for a modern Nepal specialist. Hence, he took some time off from dissertation writing to obtain a diploma in the “Teaching of English Overseas”. As he told me recently, this he did as an “insurance policy.” After applying unsuccessfully to academic jobs, Whelpton moved to Hong Kong in 1987 and started to work as an English teacher during the day and a Nepal researcher in the evenings. Things have not changed much in the subsequent years. In the large landscape of American higher education, there are exactly three academic historians of Nepal with tenure: Mark Liechty at the University of Illinois in Chicago (his 1994 PhD is in anthropology, but he has a joint appointment in the history department), Bernardo Michael at Messiah University, and Sanjog Rupakheti at College of the Holy Cross (2012 PhD from Rutgers University). As far as I know, no academic historians of Nepal hold tenured positions in the UK, France, Germany and Japan. RepercussionsThe situation regarding the major absence of non-Nepali historians researching the history of Nepal has been further compounded by the fact that in Nepal, apart from TU and Nepal Sanskrit University (NSU), MA or PhD degree training in the discipline of history has not been available in our newer universities. The number of NSU graduates in history is small, meaning graduate-degree oriented training in history has been limited to TU. This has resulted in inbreeding and a lack of institutional diversity in producing historians. This situation is not very healthy for the social life of the discipline of history since diversity in institutional settings and research approaches is essential for the continued vitality of the subject.Had there been many videshi historians researching the histories of Nepal, then this inbreeding in TU would not have been a major problem. The foreign historians would have brought their national and institutional traditions of historical scholarship to bear on their work on Nepal. They would have also brought a variety of analytical perspectives and approaches. But that has not happened, and this situation is not likely to change anytime soon for the reason discussed earlier. A partial saving grace has been the work of historically minded videshi anthropologists from various countries. I have in mind the work of the late Richard Burghart, Veronique Bouillier, Mary Des Chene, Stephen Mikesell, and several others. But their work has not captured the attention of Nepali historians. Additional mitigation has come from the historical research being done by academics trained in other disciplines (such as Indology and sociology) or in non-university based institutions (for example, Samshodhan Mandal). If new foreign academics are not doing doctoral work in history on Nepal and inbreeding is a problem, then what can we do? First, TU should hire Nepali historians trained in institutions outside of Nepal to revitalise its Master’s and PhD programmes in history. Such a possibility is more viable today than 20 years ago since several Nepalis have either just finished or are about to finish PhDs in history at different universities in other countries. TU could also consider headhunting individuals who have done important historical research but have higher degrees in other disciplines. But given its bureaucratic nature, I don’t expect this to happen anytime soon.Second, other Nepali universities should start graduate programmes in history. In this regard, the recent MOU signed between Kathmandu University and the Southasia Institute for History and Philosophy to explore the possibility of running a Master’s programme in history and philosophy is welcome news. Third, more Nepalis should pursue PhDs in history in good universities in India, the US, UK and other countries so that we have a much larger pool of formally trained historians with diverse institutional and intellectual backgrounds. Despite the general decimation of public universities in India, there are still several history departments in Indian universities where you can get decent training. Several universities in the UK have good history departments, but the funding for foreign students has mostly dried up. History departments in many good American universities do tend to support their doctoral students with financial aid. So prospective Nepali graduate students should check out some possibilities there.

We also sustained nearly 5 billion cyberattacks in 2023.Approximately, 50 government websites were hacked, and there were around eight incidents of data breaches in 2022-2023. In an alarming case, India’s weak cyber security architectural plan and IT infrastructure was exposed two years ago, when in 2022, AIIMS Delhi succumbed to a ransomware attack, compromising critical healthcare services for almost two weeks.

However, it seems Uttarakhand overlooked it for want of vision. There seems no plausible answer why the Uttarakhand Government does not have a proper cyber crisis management plan. More so because two years ago, the same Government of Uttarakhand, tasked ITI Limited, in Bengaluru to craft a disaster recovery plan. But it seems the matter has been in cold storage since then. It never saw the light of the day. Probably the government has so far treated cyber security as another welfare scheme which is announced during elections and forgotten until the next term. If this is the case, then we are heading for a bigger aftermath of a disaster after the data breach.A prudent cyber expert’s mind may ask what prevented the State Government from implementing a plan in the last two years? Given the escalating number of global cyberattacks, the State Government urgently needs more specific regulations, guidelines, procedures, or standard operating procedures (SOPs) to combat these crimes. Immediate policy changes and the implementation of effective measures to counter cyber threats are not just necessary but crucial.

While now the State Government has filed an FIR under section 308(4)(extortion) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sahinta, 2023 and 65/66/66C of the IT Act, 2000, there is a dire need for an overhaul of Uttarakhand’s cyber security basic architectural design, recruitment of subject matter experts, inviting consultants on board, setting up cyber security nodal officers in every department, rigorous and continuous training and constant engagement for evolving a cyber-security plan because such attacks may happen again.Precaution is the best cure. A half-baked cyber security plan cannot ensure the safety and security of the residents of Uttarakhand.

It is quite evident that the Uttarakhand Government could not smell or see this coming despite enough reportage of cybercrimes across the country.It was knocking on our doors, and we opened our door wide open, then shooting the ransomware to mitigate the damage.

While now the State Government has filed an FIR under section 308(4)(extortion) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sahinta, 2023 and 65/66/66C of the IT Act, 2000, there is a dire need for an overhaul of Uttarakhand’s cyber security basic architectural design, recruitment of subject matter experts, inviting consultants on board, setting up cyber security nodal officers in every department, rigorous and continuous training and constant engagement for evolving a cyber-security plan because such attacks may happen again.Precaution is the best cure. A half-baked cyber security plan cannot ensure the safety and security of the residents of Uttarakhand. Uttarakhand is known for cloud burst disasters and 2 October perhaps will be remembered as the Uttarakhand’s Cyber Security Cloud Burst, till a robust plan is placed on the table. It is quite evident that the Uttarakhand Government could not smell or see this coming despite enough reportage of cybercrimes across the country.It was knocking on our doors, and we opened our door wide open, then shooting the ransomware to mitigate the damage. A healthy dialogue between cyber experts and the Government is now warranted for a future roadmap that may not only help rebuild Uttarakhand from the crisis and may even serve as a model for other States to borrow from.-The Statesman (India)/ANN "},{"hash":"1deba57d94f750febeea4bc1756a332327ba5e0ef20554f29eb29e54e534e3de","title":"bagmati-s-self-harm","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/11/14/bagmati-s-self-harm","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/cabinet121120240838481000x0-1731551561.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1731542400000,"source":"kp","category":"editorial","content":"The Bagmati provincial government has made a decision that undercuts the foundation of the provincial system.

This year too the country witnessed the monsoon continuing beyond the end of the normal monsoon season, flooding the country until late September. Similarly, in August, the glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in Solukhumbu district swept away several houses and displaced 135 people in Thame village, a prominent destination in the Everest region. The fears about climate change seem to be coming true. Unfortunately, the worst is yet to come, with the Himalayas projected to reach the ‘peak GLOF risk’ by 2050, according to the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD). The Conference of the Parties (COP), the annual global platform on climate change, has provided developing countries with the opportunities to discuss the issue, negotiate compensation and demand accountability for the impacts of climate change with developed countries whose carbon emissions disproportionately drive global warming. As a negligible contributor to carbon emissions and among the most vulnerable countries to climate change, Nepal will conduct a high-level session on climate change under President Ram Chandra Paudel’s leadership in Baku, Azerbaijan today. The country’s agenda for COP-29 includes protecting its Himalayas, securing committed climate finance, improving access to climate funds and asking for the quick operation of the loss and damage fund established last year. Yet, a big question remains: Can Nepal’s leaders effectively convey these urgent needs at COP, and will these discussions lead to concrete action back home?Domestically, Nepal’s climate policies are often sidelined due to political inaction. The Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) should be updated to reflect developing climate scenarios and national priorities. Yet, from 2020 to 2023, Nepal’s NDCs remained stalled. Only last year was an updated version, also called the second NDC, finally approved. However, this leaves us less time to progress before countries submit updated NDCs by 2025. Moreover, in successive COPs, Nepal’s representatives have failed to make their case convincingly, reducing such conferences to formalities. The developed countries, for their part, meet, discuss and commit but fail to reduce the impacts of climate change by mitigating the use of fossil fuels. There are also concerns that Donald Trump, as the new American president, could pull the US out of the Paris Agreement, as he did in his last tenure. This will further dampen the spirit of such conferences. Despite such challenges, Nepal should continue to strongly raise its voice for compensation for low-carbon-emitting countries. It must also join hands and speak with one voice with other developing countries facing adverse effects of climate change. This year’s COP is focused on climate finance, but as important is securing firm commitments from high-emission countries to reduce their fossil fuel dependency. Without behaviour changes alongside financial support, progress will remain limited. Developing countries should consistently monitor these commitments; multilateral agencies like the United Nations, often criticised for toothlessness, should heed their concerns by holding developed nations to a higher sense of accountability. Last year, Nepal’s climate concerns received global exposure with UN Secretary-General António Guterres’s call for serious attention toward the Himalayas and the nation. Ahead of this year’s conference, Paudel and Guterres briefly discussed climate change issues during their journey to Baku, Azerbaijan. Failing to capitalise on this attention or underplaying Nepal’s role at the conference would be a missed opportunity with lasting repercussions. Our climate leaders can make much more of the COP platform to protect lives and livelihoods at home. ","summary":"Nepal is increasingly under the siege of the adverse effects of climate change.

Many considered this an attack on freedom of expression. Just when people seemed to have grown accustomed to the ban, the current KP Sharma Oli-led government lifted the nine-month restriction on the platform on August 22. Last week, TikTok finalised its registration process in line with the 2023 directives. With the video-sharing platform officially registered and operational in the country, the debate around it seems to have subsided. But how does registration make the platform better, and why was the ban implemented so suddenly if it was going to be reversed just as swiftly?According to the Internet Service Providers Association, TikTok accounted for nearly 40 percent of the country’s internet bandwidth, with around 2.2 million users in Nepal before the ban. Unlike countries like India, which decided to ban TikTok citing privacy and security concerns, the intent of “stopping and curbing social ills and anarchy” was the sole reason highlighted by the Nepali government while banning it last year. Previously, the government stated that registration was necessary due to a rise in user complaints and the absence of company representatives in the country, which made it challenging to address concerns. Now, although our laws apply to TikTok within our territory, it remains unclear how action will be taken against legal violations. In fact, the regulations in place are not sufficient and clear enough for proper implementation. The Electronic Transaction Act, 2063 (2008) does not address specific cyber-related crimes and emerging threats such as revenge porn and online prostitution. Further, the 2023 directives specify that the point of contact must identify content that violates the guidelines, such as material promoting obscenity, vulgarity, or hate speech. However, these terms are left open to interpretation, as they lack clear definitions.Although the Cyber Bureau can collaborate with TikTok to take action, a recent Post report revealed that the bureau is critically understaffed and underfunded, with only 106 personnel. Among the staff, only a few are capable of solving cases, while the remaining ones are given administrative duties. What’s intriguing is that TikTok alone was scrutinised and banned, although the directives mandate that all social media platforms register with the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology. The video-sharing platform is only the third company to register with the ministry in Nepal after Viber and WeChat. According to the prime minister, social media platforms must be treated equally, so why are Facebook, X and Instagram, with 10.58 million, 4.66 million and 3.60 million users, respectively, allowed to operate without registration?The Australian government recently announced a ban preventing children under 16 from using social media, a decision that was met with harsh criticism. Meanwhile, in Bangladesh, the interim government’s repeal of the draconian Cyber Security Act—previously used to curb press freedom—was widely welcomed. These examples show that countries around the world are experimenting and finding ways to address the challenges of a rapidly evolving digital landscape. Social media platforms are interconnected and constantly shifting, with features like short-form videos, once unique to TikTok, now available across other platforms. This suggests banning platforms may not be the most practical way to address social media’s negative aspects. Rather than relying on populist measures, our government should invest in digital literacy and research to create thoughtful, viable regulations.

This new episode of import restriction raises many questions.For example, why have the imports been stopped now even though the BIS certificates were made mandatory in 2020? How can India stop the import of goods with Chinese components when even Indian manufacturers—be they pharmaceutical companies or steel plants—would come to a halt without the import of raw material from China? India agreed to help build a standard certification lab in Nepal, way back in 2009. Why hasn’t the lab been set up yet? And at a time when India-China relations are reported to be warming up thanks to the breakthrough in their border talks, why continue to take such a rigid position on the import of goods with Chinese components? In informal talks, the decision-makers in New Delhi tend to pass the buck to the lower level functionaries when such issues are raised.

India will struggle to be a credible actor on the global stage if it first cannot establish such credibility in its own neighbourhood.

When students there rose up in arms, the Indian political leadership was caught off guard.

Many believe that Kumaris are isolated within the confines of their homes, leading to potential long-term impacts on their mental health and well-being.However, Chanira Bajracharya, chosen as the Kumari of Patan in 2001, challenges this narrative. She says, “It is incorrect to assume that Kumaris are destined to face mental health issues later in life. This is a misconception.”In this conversation with the Post’s Sanskriti Pokharel, Bajracharya reflects on her unique journey, challenging stereotypes of isolation and mental strain associated with Nepal’s Living Goddess tradition.Has being a Kumari contributed to your sense of self and well-being?I was chosen to become a living goddess at five, which meant my childhood was far from typical. While most children experience carefree and playful years, my early life was centred around spirituality, discipline, and fulfilling a sacred role. In Hinduism and Buddhism, the ultimate aspiration is enlightenment—a state of inner peace and liberation from material attachments. Being a Kumari gave me an early start on this journey, helping me develop inner peace and a mindful, spiritual outlook.Throughout my tenure, I was surrounded by immense love and respect. Even today, as an ex-goddess, I still receive the same admiration from those around me. The rigorous discipline I had to follow as a Kumari ingrained a strong sense of perfectionism in me, which has become a defining part of my character.Countless people came to see me during those years, seeking blessings for various reasons. Some wished for career success, others hoped for academic achievements, and many sought healing from illness. It fostered a sense of compassion within me. I realised I was playing a unique role in their lives by contributing to their hopes and well-being. This sense of purpose has stayed with me even after stepping down from my role as Kumari. I still feel connected to those divine traits of compassion and perfectionism.Moreover, my tenure did not hinder my education. I was fortunate to receive focused attention from my teacher, which helped me excel academically. This educational foundation is now supporting me in building my career.Hence, being a Kumari from a young age until my mid-teens has profoundly contributed to my sense of self and well-being. Did you feel any pressure or expectations from others due to your role as Kumari? During my time as Kumari, I wasn’t explicitly “trained” on how to sit, speak, or present myself—it all came to me naturally. Once I wore the Kumari attire, I instinctively understood how to carry myself. I never felt pressured to act a certain way. Even on busy days with many visitors, I could rest if needed. At home, my parents treated me as Kumari rather than just their daughter, thoughtfully considering my needs.What emotional support did you receive during your time as the Kumari?Hearing the stories of former Kumaris who faced barriers to education and struggled to adjust after their tenure, my mother was initially worried. But fate had different plans. My mother became my emotional anchor, providing steady support. Both she and my teacher would sometimes sit with me and gently remind me that soon I would start menstruating and would have to step down as Kumari. They prepared me, explaining that people would no longer worship me and that I’d need to transition to a “normal life.” These informal counselling sessions gave me immense emotional strength.Were there any particular traditions or practices in place to nurture the mental and emotional well-being of a Kumari?There were no formal practices, but emotionally, as Kumari, I was protected. Everything was there in place for me. I was admired, adored, and loved, which nurtured my mental and emotional well-being. Were there moments when you felt isolated or disconnected from the outside world?Living at home during my time as Kumari kept me from feeling disconnected.

","summary":"The Kumari tradition has often faced scrutiny, especially from Western parts of the world, with critics viewing it as a form of child rights violation. Many believe that Kumaris are isolated within the confines of their homes, leading to potential long-term impacts on their mental health and well-being.However, Chanira Bajracharya, chosen as the Kumari of Patan in 2001, challenges this narrative. She says, “It is incorrect to assume that Kumaris are destined to face mental health issues later in life. This is a misconception.”In this conversation with the Post’s Sanskriti Pokharel, Bajracharya reflects on her unique journey, challenging stereotypes of isolation and mental strain associated with Nepal’s Living Goddess tradition.Has being a Kumari contributed to your sense of self and well-being?I was chosen to become a living goddess at five, which meant my childhood was far from typical. While most children experience carefree and playful years, my early life was centred around spirituality, discipline, and fulfilling a sacred role. In Hinduism and Buddhism, the ultimate aspiration is enlightenment—a state of inner peace and liberation from material attachments. Being a Kumari gave me an early start on this journey, helping me develop inner peace and a mindful, spiritual outlook.Throughout my tenure, I was surrounded by immense love and respect. Even today, as an ex-goddess, I still receive the same admiration from those around me. The rigorous discipline I had to follow as a Kumari ingrained a strong sense of perfectionism in me, which has become a defining part of my character.Countless people came to see me during those years, seeking blessings for various reasons. Some wished for career success, others hoped for academic achievements, and many sought healing from illness. It fostered a sense of compassion within me. I realised I was playing a unique role in their lives by contributing to their hopes and well-being. This sense of purpose has stayed with me even after stepping down from my role as Kumari. I still feel connected to those divine traits of compassion and perfectionism.Moreover, my tenure did not hinder my education. I was fortunate to receive focused attention from my teacher, which helped me excel academically. This educational foundation is now supporting me in building my career.Hence, being a Kumari from a young age until my mid-teens has profoundly contributed to my sense of self and well-being. Did you feel any pressure or expectations from others due to your role as Kumari? During my time as Kumari, I wasn’t explicitly “trained” on how to sit, speak, or present myself—it all came to me naturally. Once I wore the Kumari attire, I instinctively understood how to carry myself. I never felt pressured to act a certain way. Even on busy days with many visitors, I could rest if needed. At home, my parents treated me as Kumari rather than just their daughter, thoughtfully considering my needs.What emotional support did you receive during your time as the Kumari?Hearing the stories of former Kumaris who faced barriers to education and struggled to adjust after their tenure, my mother was initially worried. But fate had different plans. My mother became my emotional anchor, providing steady support. Both she and my teacher would sometimes sit with me and gently remind me that soon I would start menstruating and would have to step down as Kumari. They prepared me, explaining that people would no longer worship me and that I’d need to transition to a “normal life.” These informal counselling sessions gave me immense emotional strength.Were there any particular traditions or practices in place to nurture the mental and emotional well-being of a Kumari?There were no formal practices, but emotionally, as Kumari, I was protected. Everything was there in place for me. I was admired, adored, and loved, which nurtured my mental and emotional well-being. Were there moments when you felt isolated or disconnected from the outside world?Living at home during my time as Kumari kept me from feeling disconnected. When my brothers returned from school, they would share stories about their day, their experiences, and what happened in class. My teachers would also talk to me about their students and classroom events. This helped me feel connected.Interestingly, perhaps because of the “power” associated with being Kumari, I never really wanted to go outside, so I didn’t experience isolation or disconnection.What I did feel I missed out on, though, were extracurricular activities.

It will be his first bilateral visit after assuming the office in mid-July. Nepali prime ministers generally go to New Delhi first. Sudheer Sharma, former editor-in-chief of Kantipur daily, has recently published a pair of books on Nepal-China relations—‘Himalpari ko Huri’ and ‘Bhikshu, Byapar ra Bidroha’. He also frequently writes on Nepal’s relations with its two big neighbours. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Sharma on the eve of Oli’s China visit. Prime Minister Oli is all set to visit China next month. Many find it curious that he decided to go to Beijing first before visiting New Delhi. How do you see this development?Traditionally, Nepali prime ministers have given high priority to visits and engagements with our two neighbours–India and China. This is natural. Generally, the prime ministers first visited India and then went to China. I believe Prime Minister Oli tried to do the same. We see regular engagements with New Delhi at various levels. Prime Minister Oli had met his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in the last week of September. In August, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India and met Prime Minister Modi and her counterpart S Jaishankar, among other key officials there. But Delhi has yet to extend the invitation to the prime minister. So he seems to have decided not to defer his foreign visits for long and chose to visit Beijing first. We have to see this in two perspectives. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China at the invitation of Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and he is also going to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. Even in the past, Oli developed good relations with Chinese leaders. So, there are expectations that he may make the visit fruitful. An equally important concern is whether this visit impacts our relations with the southern neighbour India. I think the prime minister should focus on implementing the agreements reached during his previous visits to Beijing and during Chinese leaders’ Nepal visits. He should be mindful of not irking the southern neighbour while reaching any agreement with the northern one. I believe the prime minister is conscious of this.India often seems anxious about Chinese involvement in Nepal. Do you see any risk of this visit increasing the distance between Oli and India?Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal visited China first after he became prime minister in 2008. Even in the past, some Nepali prime ministers including Tanka Prasad Acharya went to China on their first official visit. This is not unusual. The two prime ministers—Oli and Modi—recently met in New York. India doesn’t seem ready to intensify bilateral engagements with Nepal immediately. So it is natural for the prime minister to increase engagements with China, without taking any steps that could provoke India. We should stop seeking Indian signals when dealing with China, and vice versa. We should maintain parallel relations with both the neighbours without antagonising any side.In this context, what should be the prime minister’s priorities during his China visit?We have to end our chronic problem of signing agreements and not implementing them. We make announcements and forget them. There are also some infrastructure projects China pledged to develop but there is little progress. So the prime minister should draw the Chinese leadership’s attention and press them to complete the projects on time. Some important projects such as Mugling-Pokhara and Narayanghat-Butwal road upgradation by the Chinese side have been slow, causing hardships to people. Even such issues should be communicated to the political level. Also, there are several commitments made by the Chinese government but left unimplemented. This creates an impression that China makes big promises but doesn’t keep them. Prime Minister Oli often highlights the Tokha-Chhahare road upgrade project under Chinese support but there is no satisfactory progress. Progress on preparing the detailed project report (DPR) on Nepal-China cross-border railway is unclear as well. Nepal expected some substantive support from China to make the Pokhara international airport financially feasible. Some concrete steps are needed to operate this airport. There are reports that the government has requested China to convert the loan taken to develop the airport into a grant and the prime minister will push for this during his visit. It will be an achievement if the prime minister succeeds in this. In the course of writing your recent books, you extensively interacted with Chinese officials and experts, as well as with their Nepali counterparts. What are the major factors delaying the projects? Is it lack of preparation on the Nepali side or is there any problem on the Chinese side?First, we [Nepalis] sign agreements but don’t work seriously to implement them. This is true in the case of agreements with other countries as well. We are negligent. Red tape is another problem. Third, China gives less priority to small countries like Nepal as it has so many big issues with other countries. We have to constantly follow up with them to speed things up. In the past, the two sides agreed to open more border points. This should be expedited. The people-to-people relations on the border areas were historically based on social interactions at the community level. People used to trade, marry those from the other side and interact in various ways. Of late, despite progress on infrastructure development, social engagement has been hindered. This should be rectified and new border points should be opened at Dolpa, Mustang, Gorkha, Dolakha, Taplejung, and Sankhuwasabha. We should think beyond the Capital-centric approach. This will help strengthen relations at the people’s level and give alternatives in our connectivity. We should put connectivity at the core of our relations with the two neighbours. In the past decade, we have made good progress in improving connectivity with India. A study report has been prepared on the Raxaul-Kathmandu railway project. We are building an expressway linking Kathmandu and the southern belt of the country. Integrated check posts (ICPs) have come into operation along Nepal-India border points. Cross border electricity transmission lines have been built and we have increased energy trade with India. We have thus progressed in deepening connectivity with India. We lack reliable north-south highways. Therefore, the prime minister should make connectivity a major agenda of his China visit. Given the lacklustre performance of past projects, can we be optimistic about big cross-border infra projects under Chinese help?Nepal and China have committed to run some projects under the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) concept. A key component of this concept is to upgrade connectivity between Kathmandu and Kerung that includes roads as well as a railway. The concept also envisions operating other border points. The railway project requires more study and investment and needs to consider various other factors. For now, we should prioritise opening the aforementioned border points. The Korala border point at Mustang has huge potential. Nepal is making a road that connects Mustang with the Sunauli border point with India. Centuries ago, people from Banaras used to travel to Tibet via Mustang through this route. It can be revived and made a trilateral trade route between Nepal, India and China. Similarly, Limi in Humla, Olangchugola in Taplejung, among others places, can be developed as alternative routes. As far as Kerung-Kathmandu connection is concerned, let’s first give priority to building a reliable highway. The railway project should be developed with a broader understanding between Nepal, India and China. Beijing will develop such a big project only with the big Indian markets in mind. More importantly, there are some signs of improvements in India-China relations. We have to use this as an opportunity.There are differences in the way we work and the Chinese do and there are systemic and linguistic differences as well. These factors are often blamed for lack of progress in development activities carried out with Chinese support. Can Nepalis work closely with Chinese, just like we do with Indians?Until a decade ago, several projects developed under Indian support were left in limbo. In 2015, India imposed a blockade against Nepal and that sparked anti-India sentiment. Then, India expedited several projects. This drastic change became possible as the political leadership in India realised its mistake and showed the commitment to improve things.But the same thing is not happening with China because there is a “great wall” between Nepal and China when it comes to understanding each other. The Chinese haven’t understood Nepali context. The northern neighbour should be more open and liberal in helping Nepal. Second, Nepal should also stop approaching China only when our relations with India sour. We have left this impression on the Chinese psyche. First, we should be clear about what exactly we want from China, forge consensus among major political forces and hold talks with the Chinese leaders. Then, we should be equally committed to implementing the agreements reached this way. People now take announcements of building big projects under Chinese support as propaganda. Therefore, this time the prime minister should stress on pushing the pending projects. The prime minister should tell them that even the projects announced during President Xi’s visit have not progressed and that has created a bad impression of China in Nepal.There are some differences between the coalition partners—the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress—about the funding modality of projects under the Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI). Do you think this may cause a problem?The UML wants to expedite the BRI projects while the Congress has insisted that we should accept only grants and not loans under the BRI. The prime minister should clear such dilemmas and come up with common views before he leaves for Beijing. Once they come up with a common view on such key issues, it will give a positive and strong message. The Chinese side will take it more seriously because the strong government led by the two largest parties can implement bilateral agreements.We have instances of Nepal’s political parties standing for and against important projects funded by other countries. This was seen in the case of the US-funded Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and China’s BRI. Moreover, in the past, the Chinese leaders created an impression that they preferred working with communist parties and leaders. This is neither in the interest of Nepal nor of China.There are also discussions on signing the BRI implementation plan during the visit. What are the things Nepal should be careful about while signing BRI-related agreements?Trying to get grants instead of loans is in itself good. But there is no need to be prejudiced against the BRI per se. Nepal reportedly wants to include some points specifying waivers in specific projects. We should be very careful while signing project-based agreements. For instance, what will be the conditions and funding modality of a project, will it be developed under grants or loans etcetera. All our technical experts and other brains should be engaged while signing project-based agreements and specifying conditions and other nitty-gritty to ensure that we will not have unnecessary liability and debt burden in the future. Over time, Nepal has rightly adopted a steadfast position saying that we don’t join a strategic alliance proposed by any country. It stayed away from the US government’s State Partnership Programme (SPP) and China’s Global Security Initiative (GSI) as well as from India’s security umbrella. But we can’t be isolated in development initiatives. We have to take support from India, China, the US and other countries based on our needs.Do you think the Chinese side will show magnanimity on Nepal’s requests, for instance on waiving off the loan to develop Pokhara international airport?Though the Chinese ambassador to Nepal last year claimed the airport project to be under the BRI, the case is different because it was signed years before we joined the BRI. And, converting that loan into a grant is not a big deal for China. They should show magnanimity given the support we have been providing to China for a long time. If you see things historically, Nepal has helped China by suppressing Khampa revolt, preventing free Tibet movements on our soil and showing a steadfast commitment to One-China policy. China, which is now prosperous, should definitely show magnanimity and waive off loan of Pokhara airport. They shouldn’t see relations with Nepal through a purely transactional lens.In your book, you describe 2008 as a watershed after which the engagements between Nepal and China increased drastically. But why couldn’t we benefit from the northern neighbour in terms of development?The Chinese side looks more interested in increasing engagement. They like to showcase their development before foreigners. But more than lavish hospitality, we need substantive support from the neighbour, which has emerged as the world’s second-largest economy. But we should be clear about what we want from our engagements with China.  The Nepali side doesn’t present its proposals clearly. On certain issues, our politicians give mixed signals. This time, if this government of two largest parties reaches a certain agreement with China and remains committed to implement it, other forces can’t hinder it. The same approach can be replicated while dealing with India, the US, Japan or other friendly countries.Is difficult geography still a barrier in developing cross-border infrastructure projects and deepening relations between Nepal and China?In our textbooks we read that the Himalayan range is a natural barrier between the two countries. In my book ‘Bhikshu Byapar ra Bidroha’, I have explored and described how people from Nepal and northern India had been traversing through these mountains and there were interactions and engagements between the people in this part of the world since the 5th and 6th centuries. So, the mountains weren’t barriers even at that time. Now technology has made things easier. We have to think about how to connect with these two big economies. We have multiple east-west highways. Now we need north-south highways connecting the three countries that will help us reap benefits from India and China.At present, relations between these two countries have improved and it is an opportunity for us. We have to forge understanding with both India and China if we have to materialise big projects based on trilateral agreement. One thing we can’t accept is the concept of two-plus-one (India, China plus Nepal). That is unacceptable because it downgrades Nepal to a junior partner. We need trilateral agreements to develop mega connectivity-related and other investment projects but such agreements should be made on an equal-footing between the three countries.

Now we need north-south highways connecting the three countries that will help us reap benefits from India and China.At present, relations between these two countries have improved and it is an opportunity for us. We have to forge understanding with both India and China if we have to materialise big projects based on trilateral agreement. One thing we can’t accept is the concept of two-plus-one (India, China plus Nepal). That is unacceptable because it downgrades Nepal to a junior partner. We need trilateral agreements to develop mega connectivity-related and other investment projects but such agreements should be made on an equal-footing between the three countries.

He resigned from the position in 2009, after which he dedicated himself in the study of national and international politics. The Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed him to serve on several high-level panels—for Bangladesh’s 2008 parliamentary elections and for South Sudan’s referendum process in 2010-11. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Pokharel to better understand Nepal’s own electoral system and the influence of big business on its political parties.The latest episode of Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land to CPN-UML and his announcement of a sophisticated party office building at the land has of late been a topic of hot debate. People see this as an example of how politicians and businessmen work in collusion. How do you see it?Our legal provisions in this connection have some loopholes. The law allows political parties to collect donations to run their organisations, to contest elections and to carry out other activities. The law is silent on who can make such donations and how much they can do it. This is a gap in our law. Our political parties have for long been misusing the loopholes, and now they are doing so openly. The laws have also identified some sources of income for the parties such as the levy by their members, donations they get and the incomes the parties make in various ways. The amount they earn from these sources is negligible. But most major corruption cases, and mainly policy-related corruption, are linked to those who fund the political parties. This in turn is linked to the trend of elections increasingly becoming expensive. Politicians need money and those with money need access to powerful politicians. So, this is mutually beneficial for politicians and businesspeople. Such activities have been taking place for decades, but the level of such collusion has increased significantly of late.Is accepting donations from Gurung problematic as there are pending corruption and fraud cases against him or is accepting donations from business people inherently questionable?Our law hasn’t set clear criteria in this connection. Laws in some countries have categorically defined certain fundamental things such as from whom parties can take donations, how much and what type of money they can accept and how to make the deal transparent. In developed democracies, political financing is strictly monitored and regulated. In our case, we didn’t even fix the limit of the amount a businessperson can donate to a political party and whether that should be linked to the profit and tax the person pays to the state. Even the individuals who haven’t paid tax to the state citing losses in their businesses might be donating big sums to political parties or individual politicians. Therefore, there should be certain criteria to regulate political financing. Certain provisions empower the Election Commission to take action. For instance, if someone wants to help a political party or a candidate financially with more than Rs25,000, the person has to give the money through a bank. The commission can cancel someone’s candidacy or take other actions if the candidate is found to have made excessive expenses in breach of election laws. But our agencies are weak in terms of enforcement. The political parties submit the details of their financial transactions but that is often audited by a chartered accountant who might be a party cadre. The Election Commission hasn’t succeeded in investigating such malpractices. Will a law on conflict of interest help control such malpractices?We need a couple of things soon. First, the state should formulate and enforce a law on conflict of interest. It will define certain issues on conflict of interest involving politicians, business people and other stakeholders and make the officials making decisions accountable. Second, there is a need to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t. Of late, there is tendency of making decisions from Cabinet meetings to avoid prosecution from the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) as the anti-corruption body is not allowed to investigate Cabinet’s policy decisions. The CIAA leadership has an excuse not to get involved in the decisions of the politicians who appoint them. All Cabinet decisions are not policy decisions. So, it has become urgent to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t and what kind of issues the CIAA and other investigating agencies can investigate.People in general say that corruption has of late increased. Is that the case?There is no society completely free of corruption. I have been observing the functioning of our state mechanisms for the past five decades. During the Panchayat [1960-1990], everything was controlled by the palace. And, the royals and their kin were linked when there was a high-level corruption case. In the 1980s, a corruption case involving the procurement of a Boeing surfaced. A commission led by a Supreme Court justice showed the involvement of prince Gyanendra [who later became King] but its report was not implemented as the then King Birendra didn’t muster the courage to take action against his own brother. At the time, politicians didn’t dare to get involved in serious corruption cases as there was a fear of action from the palace. Over time, the volume of corruption increased with the increment in the amount of financial transactions. There is corruption even in countries like Japan and South Korea that have made exemplary progress in development. Leaders including prime ministers, ministers have been prosecuted and even faced jail terms on corruption charges. Based on that, some argue that corruption is somehow attached to development because there is mobilisation of huge resources. But there is a big difference with what is happening here. There, they take action against whoever is involved. Presidents and prime ministers have been jailed, some have even committed suicide. But in our case, top political leadership is not prosecuted. The other aspect is that after the reinstatement of democracy and the start of the republican order, the media made more corruption cases public, which was not the case during the King’s regime.Do you see any connection between the political parties and the rampant corruption in recent decades?Our party organisations became too burdensome. In developed democracies, political parties become active when there is a need for their role. At other times, they go ‘into hibernation’. The party leaders and members return to their regular businesses and remain busy there. For instance, at present, the Democrats and Republicans in the US have concentrated all their energy to help their respective candidates win. Once the election is over, they return to their regular businesses. Similar is the situation in other developed democracies. This happens when a democracy attains maturity. Conversely, in our case, the cadres are totally dependent on their organisations. And even general people want things done through party channels. From the grassroots to the centre, people go to party offices for recommendations to get something done from government agencies. This is how parties have become parallel power centres to the state agencies. The government bodies have been weakened. Hence, the way our political organisations, their leaders and cadres are managed has become the source of corruption. And it has weakened elected governments because they aren’t allowed to work independently. Government officials are also forced to work as per the order given by a head of the local chapter of a political party, not by the elected representatives with people’s mandate.There is another more concerning trend. These days the government’s decisions are influenced by certain interest groups that have huge money. There are around two dozen big business houses who influence the state’s decision-making process no matter which party leads the government. First they make informal decisions on certain key issues. Then, the Parliament, a government agency, or a court, whichever is concerned, endorses it. So now the real power doesn’t lie with elected representatives or state agencies. The interest groups wield real power.How to stop it?The state should fund political parties to cover their genuine expenses such as election expenditures and regular costs needed to run party organisations. This helps break the nexus between politicians and business tycoons and to check corruption. Once the political parties get money from state coffers, their expenditures will be strictly regulated by the law. They won’t be allowed to take outside donations. After that, the Office of the Auditor General will audit their accounts.But how can we ensure the parties and their leaders are taking no donations even after they get state funding?The law will bar both the donors and recipients from being involved in offering and taking donations. Then, the donors can say that they can’t give money to the political parties as that will be a crime of breaching the law. The policy only works if the state agencies strongly enforce the law.Other countries have made huge progress in terms of development despite corruption being rampant there. Why do we lag behind?We adopted the form of governance that accepts Parliament as the most sovereign body. But, in reality, the power lies with the chiefs of three major parties. The Parliament rubber stamps whatever they decide. And, they are influenced by certain interest groups. The legislature seeks political parties’ decisions even to follow its procedures. The other most powerful institution as per our constitution is the prime minister. But, in reality, the prime minister always struggles to appease coalition partners. Another important state pillar is the judiciary, which has been weakened by politicisation. Constitutional bodies could have played an important check and balance role but the politicians wanted to use them to serve their interests. With the weakening and non-functioning of state agencies, misrule prevails. In other countries, laws and state agencies work, and therefore they progressed.Is there a viable way to clean up our corrupt system? First the leaders that messed things up and brought the country to this situation should retire. The leaders who led historic political movements have failed to maintain their height. The narrative of ‘there is no hope’ has spread. This will not stop unless the present leadership retires. Things will improve if they voluntarily retire from politics. But they aren’t ready for that.How do you evaluate the present government’s performance after its 100 days in office?I was optimistic at the beginning and expected that they would work differently and instil hope in the people, mainly on good governance. But they gave continuity to the same mistakes they committed in the past. As the two largest parties are in the government, they have a chance to sow hope in the country, but the signs in the past 100 days aren’t encouraging. They deserve credit for the initiative to amend transitional justice related laws and to begin the process to constitute the two TJ bodies. Also, the government successfully restored connection of the Kathmandu Valley with other parts of the country after the devastating floods and landslides.Our major concern is that if this experiment of a government of two largest parties fails, it will raise questions over our system. It won’t be limited to the failure of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, it will be projected as a failure of the system. A number of groups are unhappy with the system the present constitution adopted in 2015. The governing parties’ failure will give them a ground to raise questions over the system, at a time when a large section of the society is fed up with seeing “the same old faces”. Individual leaders’ failure may push our democratic system in a crisis. This is more concerning. At the time of forming this coalition, they said that they joined hands due to the special circumstances of the country. But they didn’t work as per the special needs.You wrote a book entitled Preventing Election Violence Through Diplomacy in 2020 after a comprehensive research on some African countries. Do you see any similarities between politics of Africa and Nepal?In the course of that research, I studied some elected as well as non-elected dictators in Africa and Latin America. The dictators always think along the lines of ‘me and mine’. Instead of strengthening state agencies, they want to turn the agencies in their favour. Over time, some dictators realise they are making one mistake after another and they reach a point where they want to quit. But the coterie that surrounds the leader doesn’t allow him or her to quit. Those who are benefitting from the rule even threaten to kill the dictator if he/she plans to call it quits. Then, the dictators want some external intervention, beyond the tight circle. I found such circumstances in my case studies. It is so unfortunate that I see something similar happening in Nepal. The way a group of people encircle our top leaders and defend even their wrongdoings, it gives me a feeling of deja vu. In our case, some leaders are advised not to quit as a true successor has not been groomed.  ","summary":"Former chief election commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel successfully conducted the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008.

He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isn’t possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the country’s largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oli’s acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We can’t say anything about the government agencies’ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies can’t enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSP’s concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperatives’ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhane’s case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepal’s development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal can’t progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them weren’t built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people aren’t brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individuals’ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies can’t take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai—were not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers weren’t prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the party’s transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our party’s agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesn’t mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party can’t accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our party’s present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance. ","summary":"During his term as home minister in the previous Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government that was toppled in mid-July, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who is also senior vice-chair of the CPN (Maoist Centre), undertook some bold actions. He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isn’t possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the country’s largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oli’s acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We can’t say anything about the government agencies’ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies can’t enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSP’s concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperatives’ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhane’s case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepal’s development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal can’t progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them weren’t built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people aren’t brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individuals’ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies can’t take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai—were not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent.

But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics.

At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies.

Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies.
