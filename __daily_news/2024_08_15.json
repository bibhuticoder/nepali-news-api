With consent from the top leadership the mechanism on August 7 reached a written agreement on the bill. Based on the tripartite agreement, the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the lower house approved the bill, which was under consideration for over a year, the very next day. The erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal government had in March last year introduced the bill in parliament. It was under consideration for more than a year following differences among the parties on the content until last week’s agreement.The bill that was presented in parliament on Tuesday got endorsed the next day after all the lawmakers except the only one from the Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party stood against it. Addressing the House, before the bill was put to a vote, top leaders of big parties claimed the country was moving towards accomplishing the remaining task of the peace process—the transitional justice. Putting his view before the lower house, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli said Nepal’s transitional justice process would be completed by adopting Nepal’s own homegrown model. “The commissions will get full shape with the new Act in place and they will get a favourable environment to function,” said Oli, who also is the chairperson of the CPN-UML. “Our transitional justice process will be exemplary, setting an example to the world.”The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of the Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons are lying paralysed for over two years in the absence of their office bearers. Although a committee led by Om Prakash Mishra, a former Supreme Court chief justice is in place, it has not been able to function following the National Human Rights Commission’s refusal to send its representative demanding amendment to the Act.Also addressing the lower house, Nepali Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba claimed that the bill ensures truth, justice, reparation and non-occurrence of the conflict. “It adheres to our existing laws, the verdict of the Supreme Court and international standards of transitional justice,” he said.Similarly, CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal said the endorsement in the bill will lead the country towards the conclusion of the peace process. “Our peace process is a model in the world. We are leading it with our own experience and methods,” he said.While the top leaders unanimously claimed that the bill ensures a victim-centric transitional justice process with no amnesty for serious violations of human rights, the victims and the human rights defenders have divided opinions on the bill that got through the lower house. A group of victims united under the National Network of Victims and Survivors of Serious Human Rights and National Association of Conflict Rape Victims have jointly welcomed the endorsement of the bill calling it a historic achievement. Ram Bandari and Devi Khadka coordinators of the two associations respectively have jointly said that the bill is in line with the demands of the grassroots victims for prompt truth, justice and reparation. However, Charan Prasai, a human rights activist said the bill is full of flaws guided by amnesty even in serious violations of human rights. “The parties had in 2015 introduced the law unanimously, but it was struck down by the court. The bill endorsed on Wednesday too is full of problematic provisions,” he said.The bill lists rape or serious cases of sexual violence, intentional or arbitrary killing, enforced disappearances and inhumane or cruel torture as serious violations of human rights and thus non-amnestiable. Other incidents fall under human rights violations and are amnestiable. One of the provisions in the bill clears the way for reconciliation in cases other than serious violations of human rights. The attorney general cannot be forced to press ahead with a legal case in incidents of human rights violations or serious violations of human rights where there has been reconciliation or a recommendation for amnesty, according to the bill.Except in cases of rape or serious sexual violence, there can be a reduction in the sentencing by 75 percent if the perpetrators fulfil some set criteria. Decisions on reduced penalty can be taken after examining whether the perpetrators provide information on the allegations against them, whether they cooperate with the commissions on evidence collection and whether they express remorse for their acts. Similarly, before recommending a reduction in penalty, the commissions need to evaluate whether the perpetrators have apologised to the victims and made commitments to not repeat such acts. All disqualified Maoist combatants including child soldiers, along with the families of security personnel who died or got injured during the insurgency, will get reparation and compensation, as per the agreement. However, the issue of child soldiers, which is considered a war crime, along with crimes against humanity and other acts of war crime is not mentioned in the agreement.Now the bill will be forwarded to the upper house for approval. It will come into force after the authentication from the President.Meanwhile, some Kathmandu-based diplomatic missions have welcomed the development. Within hours after the House endorsed the bill, the envoys took to social media to congratulate Nepal terming it a historic achievement.US Ambassador Dean R Thompson congratulated the people of Nepal on the occasion. \"This is a meaningful moment in Nepal’s journey to shaping its own peaceful, prosperous, resilient, and democratic future,\" he wrote on X.United Nations Resident Coordinator Hanaa Singer-Hamdy described the passage of the bill as a crucial step in the peace process. “Engaging victims is imperative - 'nothing for us without us' - for successful implementation,\" she wrote on X. “The UN stands ready to support inclusive TJ aligning with international human rights commitments and standards.\"Also, Veronique Lorenzo, the ambassador of the European Union to Nepal, congratulated Nepal and Nepali people for the historic achievement.

Jha, a prime suspect in the high-profile Bhutanese refugee scam, faces charges of cheating, forgery, state fraud, and organised crime. “Today, the court recorded Jha's statement, and the hearing will start on Thursday,” said a lawyer at the District Public Prosecutor’s office. Nepal Police, which has been investigating the scam for over a year, arrested Jha on June 28. Santosh Raj Katwal, an officer with the District Public Prosecutor’s Office, filed a supplementary case against Jha. “A case has been filed against Jha similar to those of previous defendants who were arrested and charged with fraud for falsifying identities to send individuals to the US as Bhutanese refugees,” Katwal told the Post. The government is calling for Jha to be punished for multiple offences. The indictment states, “Since it is apparent that he has committed several offences in a single, organised and planned incident, additional punishment should be given in accordance with Section 43 (1) of the National Penal (Code) Act 2017.” Earlier, in a statement to the police, Jha had claimed: “I have no knowledge about Bhutanese refugees [scam].” Jha had also denied his affiliation with any political party and said he did not know Teknarayan Pandey, the former home secretary implicated in the scam.During the investigation, police found a cheque for Rs20 million issued in Jha’s name by another suspect, Ramsharan KC. Jha denied any knowledge of this transaction. In a further twist, investigators presented an audio recording of a conversation between Jha and KC, but Jha insisted that the voice on the recording was not his.However, according to statements collected from other defendants, Jha received a cheque for Rs20 million from Ramsharan KC, claiming that the money would be used to secure the endorsement of a forged document on Bhutanese refugee resettlement through the Council of Ministers. Jha, in his statement, has stressed, “I am not aware of the cheque for Rs20 million.” The report submitted by the District Police of Kathmandu to the District Public Prosecutor mentions that Jha declined to take a polygraph test. According to the Kathmandu District Police Office, Jha's refusal to undergo the test has heightened further concerns over his role in the scam.When the police attempted to administer a polygraph test, Jha refused to participate, according to Dan Bahadur Karki, spokesperson for the Nepal Police.“The accused can refuse a polygraph test, but that does not stop the case from proceeding,” Karki told the Post. “More details about his involvement in the scam will emerge in court, as the case now has been filed in the district court.” Senior inspector of Nepal Police, Anju Kandel, who works in the polygraph branch of the police headquarters, reported to the Kathmandu District Police Office that Jha refused to take the polygraph test. A report documenting Jha's reluctance to take the polygraph test has been included in the case against him filed in the District Court of Kathmandu, says the police officer.On June 16 last year, the Kathmandu District Court ruled that 16 people, including former deputy prime minister Top Bahadur Rayamajhi and former home minister Bal Krishna Khand, should be jailed after a hearing in the fake Bhutanese refugee scam case.Along with Rayamajhi, who was also the secretary of the CPN-UML, and Nepali Congress senior leader Khand, home secretary Pandey, former home minister Ram Bahadur Thapa’s security adviser Indrajit Rai, Khand’s personal secretary Narendra KC, former Congress lawmaker Aang Tawa Sherpa, and Bhutanese refugee leader Tek Nath Rizal, among others, were sent to judicial custody following the court's decision. Khand and Rizal were later released on bail. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees closed the third-country resettlement of Bhutanese refugees in December 2016 after most of the refugees left for Western countries. In 2019, the government led by KP Sharma Oli, had formed a task force under then joint secretary Bal Krishna Panthi to recommend ways to manage the Bhutanese refugees who remained in Nepal after the third-country resettlement programme ended. The task force submitted a report that included 429 Bhutanese refugees who had been left behind. Later, the racketeers, in collusion with some top government officials, prepared another report and fraudulently added hundreds of others people to the list of refugees. The scam came to light after many individuals, mostly Nepalis, who had paid the racketeers large sums to be included in the Bhutanese refugee resettlement programme, were unable to go to the US and subsequently lodged complaints with the police and reported the matter to the media.Several media reports suggest Jha is one of the kingpins of the scam with connections to powerful politicians in Nepal. He reportedly possesses citizenships of both Nepal and India.  ","summary":"Hearing on the case against Bechan Jha, filed by the District Public Prosecutor's Office in the Kathmandu District Court on Tuesday, is set to begin on Thursday.

The World Health Organisation’s report on integrated influenza and other respiratory virus surveillance for week 31 of 2024 shows a SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate of 13.68 percent in Nepal. Also, the latest data from the National Public Health Laboratory indicates a sharp increase in cases. Of the 5,373 tests conducted since January, 341 came out positive for Covid. The test positivity rate is 6.3 percent, which is concerning, according to experts.Doctors say that the number of people suffering from fever, sore throat, body aches, and common cold has risen.The COVAX facility, the United Nations-backed international vaccine-sharing scheme, supplied Nepal with 1.6 million monovalent vaccine doses in the first week of July.Officials said that around 100,000 children with underlying conditions—cancer, HIV, and others will be administered the vaccine.Along with these children, pregnant women, people with compromised immunity, those with chronic diseases, and people over the age of 55 have been designated as vulnerable groups, officials said.Since the end of the second wave of Covid in 2021, health authorities across Nepal have stopped active case finding, including contact tracing and free testing. Hospitals now only conduct tests for those seeking polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for travel abroad or for seriously ill patients with respiratory conditions. Multiple doctors the Post spoke with said that the circulation of coronavirus has never stopped and is unlikely to stop in the near future.Infectious disease experts and virologists urge the public to take precautions to protect the elderly and people with comorbidities from the deadly virus. They warn that even if most people may not show severe symptoms from Covid infection, the elderly and people with underlying conditions remain at high risk.“We saw elderly people requiring intensive care during the previous surge in April,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “It’s time to return to the basics—washing hands, wearing face masks, avoiding crowds—to save at-risk groups like the elderly and those with underlying conditions.”Over 12,000 people died, and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic.Meanwhile, the National Public Health Laboratory said that an Omicron sub-variant of the coronavirus is responsible for the surge in new infections of late. According to the latest update issued by the laboratory, the Omicron variant has been found in all 42 swab samples in the whole genome sequencing.Whole-genome sequencing is a comprehensive method of analysing the entire DNA sequence of an organism’s genes. Researchers believe this approach could be instrumental in tracking the virus’s severity and properties.This time, however, the laboratory has not provided information about the specific Omicron sub-variant.

A circular has been sent via the Saarc Secretariat to the seven member states.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has started the groundwork for Nepal’s participation in the 79th UN General Assembly. Officials said that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is likely to lead the Nepali delegation to the general assembly.On Tuesday, Saarc Secretary General Md Golam Sarwar held talks with Foreign Minister Arzu Rana and discussed the upcoming meeting of the Saarc Council of Ministers on the margins of the UNGA in New York. Sarwar congratulated her on assuming the responsibility of foreign minister and the chair of the SAARC Council of Ministers, the Saarc secretariat said in a statement. The two officials are said to have discussed issues of regional cooperation.The meeting needs the consent of the seven member states to convene, which Nepal is hopeful about, a joint-secretary at the foreign ministry said. “Since we recently sought their concurrence, it will take some time for approvals to arrive from all member states.”Saarc is holding the meetings of the programming committee and others, but to ensure a higher level of engagement, it needs to hold the meetings of the Council of Ministers, said the joint-secretary. “As the longest-serving chair of Saarc, we want to hand over the baton to the next member by holding the 19th Saarc Summit.”The 19th Summit was scheduled to take place in Pakistan, but due to cross-border terrorism and an attack on the Indian Army base, the summit was cancelled. In the last eight years, the Nepali side has made no serious effort to hand over the grouping’s chair. Due to the longstanding rivalry between India and Pakistan, the entire SAARC process has stalled since 2016.The New York meeting, considered a “tone-setter” to high-level meetings, including the summit, could not occur in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023.In 2019, the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan boycotted each other’s addresses at a meeting of the SAARC Council of Ministers organised on the margins of the 74th UN General Assembly.In 2020, the meeting was held virtually, and the member states pledged to enhance regional integration, but it could not end the logjam in the SAARC process. In 2021, the meeting was called off at the last minute, after member states did not agree to attend. Then-prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba had hurriedly appointed Narayan Khadka as foreign minister, in preparation for the New York meeting.In 2022, the meeting did not happen as Khadka did not travel to New York, owing to the general elections at home. Last year, too, the sidelines meeting did not go ahead after representatives of the member states did not show up. As per the Saarc tradition, any meeting or summit cannot proceed if one member state objects.There have been occasional technical meetings at different levels led by bureaucrats, but they are insufficient to revitalise the regional grouping. “Committee-level small meetings have been taking place regularly,” a senior foreign ministry official said. “If there can be some kind of breakthrough in the upcoming meeting, the SAARC process will undoubtedly move ahead.”Nepal hosted the last SAARC summit in Kathmandu in 2014, and it was Pakistan’s turn to host the 19th Summit, but the event was cancelled after an attack on an Indian military camp in Kashmir. This led to a standoff between India and Pakistan, and the summit was postponed until further notice.Clouds hang over BIMSTEC SummitThe emerging political turmoil in Thailand has cast doubt over the fate of the sixth summit of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC).According to The Nation newspaper, the Constitutional Court on Wednesday unseated Srettha Thavisin from the post of prime minister, stating in its verdict that he lacked integrity to hold the top government position because he had decided to appoint an unqualified person as a Cabinet member. According to media reports, Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai will serve as acting prime minister until the House of Representatives elects a new premier. With the political confusion in Thailand, the fate of the upcoming Bimstec Summit has also become uncertain, said a Nepali diplomat based in Bangkok.Besides, other member states of the Bimstec grouping also have difficult domestic situations. With the political upheavals in Bangladesh and Myanmar and the upcoming presidential elections in Sri Lanka, most Bimstec members face some sort of domestic trouble.The political timeline in Thailand looks uncertain with new government formation likely to take some weeks. The summit is slated for September 4 and 5.Since the caretaker government is running Thai affairs, the nation’s official position remains unknown, said the Nepali diplomat. A decision on whether the Bimstec summit will happen on schedule or will be postponed could take some more days to come. ","summary":"After failing to hold the annual informal meetings of SAARC foreign ministers on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly for four consecutive years, Nepal has scheduled a similar Regional Council of Ministers meeting for September 26 in New York.Nepal has been chairing the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation since 2014, becoming the longest-serving chair in the regional grouping’s history.A senior foreign ministry official confirmed to the Post that the SAARC Council of Ministers involving seven member states, except Afghanistan, has been scheduled to meet on September 26. A circular has been sent via the Saarc Secretariat to the seven member states.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has started the groundwork for Nepal’s participation in the 79th UN General Assembly. Officials said that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is likely to lead the Nepali delegation to the general assembly.On Tuesday, Saarc Secretary General Md Golam Sarwar held talks with Foreign Minister Arzu Rana and discussed the upcoming meeting of the Saarc Council of Ministers on the margins of the UNGA in New York. Sarwar congratulated her on assuming the responsibility of foreign minister and the chair of the SAARC Council of Ministers, the Saarc secretariat said in a statement. The two officials are said to have discussed issues of regional cooperation.The meeting needs the consent of the seven member states to convene, which Nepal is hopeful about, a joint-secretary at the foreign ministry said. “Since we recently sought their concurrence, it will take some time for approvals to arrive from all member states.”Saarc is holding the meetings of the programming committee and others, but to ensure a higher level of engagement, it needs to hold the meetings of the Council of Ministers, said the joint-secretary. “As the longest-serving chair of Saarc, we want to hand over the baton to the next member by holding the 19th Saarc Summit.”The 19th Summit was scheduled to take place in Pakistan, but due to cross-border terrorism and an attack on the Indian Army base, the summit was cancelled.

As a filmmaker, what genres of books do you usually read? Nonfiction plays an essential role in my filmmaking. I am drawn to books about historical events. These broaden my knowledge and help germinate new ideas that I can incorporate into the films I work on. I also read books that attempt to blur the line between fiction and nonfiction. I tried such an approach in my film, ‘Dasdhunga’, which I have called docufiction.How do you integrate themes from literature into the narratives of your films?Literature has offered me decisive conflicts that I have integrated into my films. Both fiction and nonfiction provide individual and collective challenges, societal dilemmas, and struggles for resolution. These literary themes shape the discourse within my movies and give the foundational ideas that drive the narratives I create. Beyond just themes, literature also fuels my imagination, allowing me to create worlds my characters inhabit and bringing depth to the stories I create.What role do books play in helping filmmakers develop a deeper understanding of human emotions and relationships, as explored in ‘Chhayan’?Books, news reports and journals written about the victims of child sexual abuse became my source for movies like ‘Chhayan’.Books serve as valuable resources for filmmakers who seek to explore the complex dimensions of human emotions and relationships, which are central themes in many narratives, including this film.Literature is, in a way, a bank of subjective and objective data. It encapsulates human experiences and emotions and provides insights into human needs, desires, and dilemmas. It also guides us to delve into the coexistence of contradictions, which helps filmmakers understand the nature of life in different times and spaces. Such an understanding is crucial for filmmakers, as it allows us to create characters and stories that resonate with audiences emotionally, similar to ‘Chhayan’.How do you think reading has shaped your perspective on social and political issues, as seen in your films like ‘Greater Nepal In Quest Of Boundary’ and ‘Dasdhunga’?Reading has profoundly shaped my understanding of social and political issues, which is evident in my films, such as ‘Greater Nepal In Quest Of Boundary’ and ‘Dasdhunga’. ‘Teestadekhi Satalaj (Kagada) Samma’ and ‘Nepalko Simana’ were the books that inspired me to make the ‘Greater Nepal In Quest Of Boundary’. Additionally, the investigative news reports and historical documents published about the Dasdhunga incident that took the life of politician Madan Bhandari instilled a fire-like passion in me to make a movie about this. Literature has allowed me to empathise with various perspectives—those of victims, perpetrators, and the resilient. Through reading, I have gained a deeper understanding of the nature of power, politics, the human psyche, and the history of civilisation. This awareness has shaped my approach to storytelling and allowed me to portray the multifaceted nature of social and political issues with greater authenticity.

For aspiring filmmakers, the journey toward creating impactful cinema begins with a deep engagement with philosophy rather than merely focusing on narrative.Understanding your philosophical beliefs is crucial to shaping the themes, premises, and stories you tell.

In May 2022, he visited Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha.His visit drew thousands of Indian visitors, particularly for pilgrimage purposes.Nepal has been a centre for Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims. It is considered the dwelling place of Lord Shiva and the birthplace of Buddha and Goddess Sita. A fraction of tourists visit Nepal for religious purposes, but Nepal has never realised the potential of spiritual products that have not been branded, marketed, and promoted.Various studies have shown that religion has become a niche product in a society overrun by commercial clutter, and it could boost the economy.Now, two brothers in Janakpur, in Nepal’s southern plain, the birthplace of Sita, have devised a unique project: The construction of Janak Dham.“The work has already started. The Dham will be spread over 22 bigas (148,998 square meters) in Chhireshwarnath Municipality-8, Dhanusha,” said Kausalendra Jha, a chartered accountant.“The project costs Rs2 billion, and it looks like a palace of King Janak. The five-year project plans to produce, promote and market religious goods and services, the first of its kind in Nepal,” said Kausalendra, who has his brother Ragvendra Jha, a hotel entrepreneur, as his investment partner.Currently, 100 cows are kept in Janak Dham. The Jha brothers plan to commercially sell more than a dozen products made from cow’s milk, including urine and dung.Under the project, agriculture and industry based on cows will be built, an Ayurveda and natural hospital, a meditation and Janak Darshan Centre, a convention hall with the capacity for 1,000 people, a resort, a children's park, and an audio-video hall will be established.Pilgrimage tourism has a higher scope in Nepal. Since Nepal has become a key gateway for the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra in Tibet, China, developing and marketing religious products could primarily benefit the local economy. Annually, 40,000 to 50,000 Indians visited Tibet using Nepal’s route before the Covid-19 pandemic. Lumbini used to host nearly 1.5 million visitors, including Nepalis, before the Covid and is now gradually recovering. In 2023, about 1.2 million people visited Lumbini, especially with a significant influx of 70,000 Indian tourists. Annually, millions visit Pashupatinath temple in Kathmandu.“We also plan to sell the products through our outlets in Sankhamul, Kathmandu and Janaki temple, Janakpur,” said Kausalendra.The construction of Janak Dham is expected to be over in five phases. The first phase has almost been completed, and cow-based agriculture and industry have already started. Preparations are ready to introduce 12 products of Janak Dham to the markets of Kathmandu and Janakpur in the first phase. Kausalendra said buttermilk, takrarishta, a traditional Ayurvedic fermented buttermilk, and five varieties of ghee, including one that can be put in the nose, will be produced.Similarly, the Dham will produce colostrum, sugar-free sweets, paneer, incense sticks, gomutra ark, a distilled form of cow urine and punarnava ark, an Ayurvedic medicine used in the treatment of jaundice, anaemia, abdominal diseases, diabetes and bleeding disorders.It will also produce organic fertiliser, jackfruit flour, kolhu edible oil, and food grains prepared traditionally. “All our products are made with cow’s milk, urine and dung. Made from A2 milk, which contains lactose and is chock-full of key nutrients like protein and calcium, all our production has Ayurvedic characteristics,” said Kausalendra.He said that as the production of Janak Dham is limited, it is currently targeted at two cities.The Dham started with 100 cows of different breeds, such as hariyana, sahibal, gir, and achhami, and plans to increase the number of cows by 400.“Madhesh is the foodgrain basket. However, the application of toxic pesticides has been impacting people’s health. The food grains nurtured by cow dung fertiliser are healthy,” Kausalendra said.The farmer of Digambarpur, where the Dham is located, has started using organic manure.Kausalendra, who worked for a long time in agriculture projects under the World Bank, said they decided to change their lifestyle during the Covid-19 period. So, the Jha brothers decided during a coronavirus lockdown to make Janak Dham.“We do not need to bring raw material from other places to produce our goods. Everything is produced here,” they said. “We plan to introduce our products to the elite class in the initial phase.

All seven athletes returned empty handed, having failed to break the 60-year spell of participating in Olympics without winning a medal. Those scratching their heads as to why Nepal has had a dry run all these decades needn’t look further than the Dasharath Stadium, located at the nerve centre of Kathmandu. The country’s most famous stadium was a sight to see on Tuesday. Nepal’s Church Boys United lost to Bhutan’s Paro FC, which was a shock for Nepali fans. But the match result was hardly a topic of discussion on Tuesday evening. Rather, it was the ground of the country’s only international-standard stadium hosting an international match. It was a messy affair on the ground as the 22 boys jostled for the ball, slipping on the puddled, muddy ground all the time. As the Nepali players struggled to clinch a win against the visiting team, the photographs circulating on social and mainstream media, of the players drenched in sludge, gave an early indication that Nepal was set to lose an image war internationally. The Japanese football icon Keisuke Honda, a member of the Bhutan squad, was right on point when he called the Bhadrakali ground a joke. It’s not clear whether Nepali authorities have taken Honda’s remark as an insult to Nepal or ignored it completely, but Honda, who has played three world cups for Japan, should be thanked for pointing out our pathetic state. The tamasha at the stadium exposed the state of our sports infrastructure and the insincerity of our authorities even when it comes to organising an international event.Alarmingly, the situation is no different in cricket, volleyball or martial arts. Nepali youths have tremendous interest and potential in sports, in addition to a fan base envied by the world. Impressed by our young talents, the international sports fraternity has shown unprecedented interest towards Nepal in recent years. But the authorities remain as lethargic as ever even to cash in on the international goodwill.There is no dearth of literature on the lackadaisical attitude of Nepali sports authorities. But there are some basics they should do immediately if Nepali sports is to get any better. First, the authorities must work to strengthen the financial security of the players. Only then we can expect better results from them. If the sportspeople are playing for the country, it is the country that should look after their needs. The prime ministers, ministers and other officials who compete to make big announcements after a Nepali team’s win in an international match should learn to walk the talk.Second, the authorities should work immediately to improve sports infrastructure. If the Dasharath Stadium is muddy, the Kirtipur Cricket Ground has no light. The Mulpani Cricket Stadium has taken decades to complete, and there are hardly any decent stadiums outside the capital city, and players are deprived of training and international exposure. The authorities must therefore ensure that the sports bodies strictly follow a calendar of events throughout the year from federal to the grassroots level to ensure a holistic development of the sector. If we continue to make the players dodge the sludge on their training ground, we cannot expect them to return home with international medals.  ","summary":"With the Paris 2024 Olympics concluding earlier this week, Nepali players have returned home.

The Japanese football icon Keisuke Honda, a member of the Bhutan squad, was right on point when he called the Bhadrakali ground a joke. It’s not clear whether Nepali authorities have taken Honda’s remark as an insult to Nepal or ignored it completely, but Honda, who has played three world cups for Japan, should be thanked for pointing out our pathetic state. The tamasha at the stadium exposed the state of our sports infrastructure and the insincerity of our authorities even when it comes to organising an international event.Alarmingly, the situation is no different in cricket, volleyball or martial arts. Nepali youths have tremendous interest and potential in sports, in addition to a fan base envied by the world. Impressed by our young talents, the international sports fraternity has shown unprecedented interest towards Nepal in recent years. But the authorities remain as lethargic as ever even to cash in on the international goodwill.There is no dearth of literature on the lackadaisical attitude of Nepali sports authorities. But there are some basics they should do immediately if Nepali sports is to get any better. First, the authorities must work to strengthen the financial security of the players. Only then we can expect better results from them. If the sportspeople are playing for the country, it is the country that should look after their needs. The prime ministers, ministers and other officials who compete to make big announcements after a Nepali team’s win in an international match should learn to walk the talk.Second, the authorities should work immediately to improve sports infrastructure. If the Dasharath Stadium is muddy, the Kirtipur Cricket Ground has no light. The Mulpani Cricket Stadium has taken decades to complete, and there are hardly any decent stadiums outside the capital city, and players are deprived of training and international exposure. The authorities must therefore ensure that the sports bodies strictly follow a calendar of events throughout the year from federal to the grassroots level to ensure a holistic development of the sector. If we continue to make the players dodge the sludge on their training ground, we cannot expect them to return home with international medals.  "},{"hash":"f16493bef6d995cec3ef5e53ca6f403b46ebc2bfbf629d2462e0aa48cdeecb7d","title":"sri-lanka-s-presidential-race","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/08/15/sri-lanka-s-presidential-race","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/srilanka-1723682490.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1723680000000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"Sri Lanka’s presidential election, scheduled for September 21, is taking an interesting turn. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peremuna (SLPP), which initially planned to nominate Ranil Wickramasinghe as the presidential candidate, has now nominated Namal Rajapakse, the son of former President Mahinda Rajapakse. Wickremesinghe was delaying his candidature announcement, giving rise to speculation that he was not interested in becoming the official nominee of SLPP, which would undermine the future of the United National Party (UNP) he heads. SLPP demanded that if Wickremesinghe wants to contest the position, he must resign from the UNP. The problem started after some of his supporters from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) proposed to sideline the Rajapakses. Moreover, Namal Rajapakse opposed Wickremesinghe’s contest from SLPP, forcing the party to reconsider its decision.Yet, Wickremesinghe has garnered support from many SLPP and Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) parliamentarians for his candidature. He has decided to contest as an independent candidate, stating that a non-party, common candidate is the need of the hour. He expects people to vote based on his performance in the last two years. The Freedom People’s Congress (FPC), a breakaway faction of SLPP, has decided to join the SJB, while another faction joined the UNP headed by Wickremesinghe. One is witnessing several permutations and combinations. At the first Ekwa Jayagamu (Victory through Unity) rally in Matara, the President called on other parties to put their personal agendas aside and work for the country. The presidential frayApart from the sitting president Wickremesinghe, who the SLPP supports at present, and Namal, the party’s official candidate in this election, Sajith Premadasa—son of former President of Sri Lanka Ranasinghe Premadasa of SJB—and Anura Kamara Dissanayake, also known as AKD of National People’s Power (NPP)—the new avatar of JVP with its notorious violent past—are also contesting. Both had contested the last presidential election and lost to Gotabaya Rajapakse. Sajith had broken away from the UNP and formed the SJB with others after having serious differences with Ranil Wickremesinghe. But Wickremesinghe benefited from the 2022 Jana Aragalaya (people’s movement). Wickremesinghe, who was the prime minister, took over as President after Gotabaya was forced to quit. Other actorsThe Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) established by the Bandaranaike family is faction-ridden, with three leaders claiming party presidency, and one faction has extended support to Sajith Premadasa. P Ariyanethiran is a Tamil candidate representing the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchchi (ITAK), part of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). After the death of the TNA supremo, it is ridden with factionalism. The Tamils have previously voted for major political parties in the presidential election. They form a crucial vote bank that can determine the outcome of the September election, as seen in the past. Many attribute the LTTE’s boycott of the 2004 election contributed to the victory of Mahinda Rajapakse.Campaign strategiesWickramasinghe’s campaigning strategy is based on Sri Lanka’s economic recovery. According to the World Bank, it is on the road to recovery, even though it considers debt restructuring inadequate and emphasises structural reforms. He wants to capitalise on this. In May, the Sri Lankan government introduced three Bills—the Economic Transformation Bill, the Public Debt Management Bill and the Public Financial Management Bill, which faced significant opposition from the SJB and the NPP. The government’s effort has been debt restructuring to utilise valuable foreign currency for economic development and attract investment. Wickramasinghe has asked all the political forces to join and, interestingly, has offered Sajith restoration of his UNP membership if he cooperates. Wickremesinghe is going to address his second rally on August 17 in Anuradhapura. His supporters, drawn from several political parties, want to form a new front to support his election. A main advantage for him is that he came to lead the country at a time when others, especially SJB’s Sajith—who came second in the 2019 Presidential election—were not prepared to take responsibility. Wickramasinghe, in his first Anuradhapura rally in July, also said that Sri Lanka’s GDP is $85 million, which should be increased to $350 million by 2028. Whether he will receive the support of the minorities is yet to be seen.Sajith Premadasa had lost the election to Gotabaya in 2019. Yet, unlike R Premadasa, he is not a charismatic leader who keeps ears to the ground. The SJB, which has formed a coalition of seven parties, will fight the election under the Samagi Jana Sandanaya (SJS) platform. Sajith has promised to continue with the IMF reforms to bring the economy back on track. The party has prioritised anti-corruption as its main plank. It is looking for the support of the minorities and has been able to enlist the support of the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) headed by Mano Ganesan, who represents Malaiyaha Tamils spread across the Central, Southern and Western provinces and that of Sri Lanka Muslim Congress.The left-leaning NPP (formerly JVP) is a strong contender in this presidential election. Its leader, Anura Kumara Bandaranaike, has visited India and other Western countries to ally the fear of these countries, given JVP’s violent past and its anti-India and anti-Western stances in the past. JVP’s leader Bandaranaike is leading in various opinion polls. In recent rallies, he has drawn massive crowds with his slogan of ushering in a ‘new renaissance’. His promises include political and economic reforms.Among all these candidates, Namal Rajapakse bears the burden of everything that has gone wrong with Sri Lanka recently. Namal has previously been a sports minister and thus has political experience. The removal of his uncle Gotabaya Rajapakse and the alleged corruption his family was involved in are still etched in people’s minds. Namal may not find an easy way, and the opinion poll puts him in a distant third.Difficult choiceWith political fragmentation across all the political parties except for the NPP, it would be difficult for voters to choose. Wickremesinghe stood a good chance and perhaps could have pulled through with the support of the SLPP and his performance in the last two years. But the NPP appears stronger and more focussed, and has a clear vision for the country. Unlike other political parties, it is not tried and tested. Its violent past and radical left ideology perhaps would not help the IMF reform plans on which Sri Lanka depends. Holding a position of power may help Anura Kamara Dissanayake to moderate his stance on economic recovery and the unemployment problem and to secure the rights of the working class.

However, there are five distinct categories of women's empowerment: social, educational, political, economic, and psychological. Unfortunately, the general perspective overlooks the essential contributions made by women in a wide range of sectors, including but not limited to childcare and house management. The realisation that women's empowerment entails more than merely engaging only in external workplaces emphasises the need for a clear and established definition of empowerment.True empowerment is built on empowering women to make life decisions free from outside pressures like discrimination, constraints, or societal standards. Women should have the freedom to pursue their interests and ambitions, regardless of whether that coincide with conventional gender stereotypes. Regardless of the route women choose, empowering them requires acknowledging and appreciating their efforts. This can involve dedicating oneself to domestic duties and family obligations or pursuing a career or engaging in both. Women will gain personally from having the autonomy to make their own decisions, as will their families and society at large. Therefore, we must acknowledge that while it is common for women to choose to work outside, it is also acceptable for other women not to make that decision.

This will be the first commercial work an unmanned aerial vehicle does in Nepal’s high-altitude zone.The heavy lifter from China’s biggest drone maker, Da Jiang Innovations (DJI), will take on tasks traditionally handled by Sherpas. Officials believe it will help reduce casualties on Everest.Then, in spring (March-May), DJI drones, which make sounds similar to a swarm of bees, will be put to work on Everest.It will fly to Camp I (5,943 metres) to supply ropes and ladders to prepare routes and bring garbage to the Everest base camp at 5,364 metres.On Sunday, a tripartite memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee, the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, and the Airlift Technology Pvt Ltd for the use of advanced drone technology to efficiently manage garbage in the mountains of the Khumbu region.In April, Chinese drone maker DJI conducted the world’s first drone delivery test on Everest.“After a successful test in April, we plan to use drones commercially in the Everest region,” said Jagat Bhusal, chief administration officer of the rural municipality that hosts Everest. The test result showed that the DJI FlyCart 30, the long-distance heavy lifter drone, could airlift 234 kg per hour between Camp I and Base Camp, a task usually accomplished by at least 14 porters in six hours. Drone manufacturer DJI is under the microscope as US lawmakers push for a ban on Chinese drones, amid deteriorating relations between the US and China, the world’s largest trading nations.Nepali officials and mountaineers, however, see the drone as a life-saving vehicle.Traditionally, local Sherpa guides are responsible for transporting supplies and clearing trash on Everest. They may need to cross the icefall over 30 times a season to transport supplies such as oxygen bottles, gas canisters, tents, food, and ropes.All climbers and guides must navigate the icefall on the route to the world’s tallest peak. The icefall is so notoriously dangerous that even experienced Sherpas hesitate to move when the sun shines.The Khumbu Icefall, a river of ice a kilometre or so long, is usually crossed at night or early morning, with climbers putting headlamps on their helmets.Normally, the route is crossed early in the morning, when the ice blocks and the hanging glaciers are stable and avalanche risks are low.During the day, as the sun warms the mountain, the hanging glaciers melt, and ice crumbles, increasing the risk of avalanche.“Using drones will help us avoid the dangers in the Khumbu Icefall,” said Bhusal. On April 18, 2014, an avalanche resulting from a falling serac buried 16 Sherpa guides in the Khumbu Icefall, eventually leading to the cancellation of the season’s expeditions.Last year, three Sherpa guides mobilised to prepare the routes were buried under the ice masses triggered by an avalanche in the Khumbu Icefall. Their bodies are yet to be recovered.The Himalayan Database and the government records show that nearly 50 individuals died on the icefall between 1953 and 2023.The climb from Everest Base Camp to Camp I takes six hours. Between these two camps lies the Khumbu Icefall, the most treacherous part of the route.The most exciting and easiest part of the route is reaching Camp II (6,400 metres), which takes four hours from Camp I.There is a set of restrictions in the mountains for carrying loads.According to government rules, workers climbing high altitudes must not carry loads exceeding 20kg between 5,000 and 6,000 metres, 17 kg between 6,001 and 7,000 metres, 14 kg between 7,001 to 8,000 metres, and 12 kg for altitudes above 8,000 metres.“Yes, there are concerns that the machines may actually cut jobs. But our sole purpose is to reduce potential deaths in the Khumbu Icefall, the danger zone,” said Bhusal.“We will train Sherpas, as drone operators cannot handle tasks at the higher camps. In the future, all work will be done by Sherpas.” In the trial phase, the drone could lift 30 kg from Camp I. However, its performance dropped to 18 kg from Camp II. “Based on the MoU framework, we will soon sign a commercial agreement with the drone supplier,” said Bhusal. “The municipality will monitor all the activities.”The municipality has, so far, spent Rs800,000 on the trial. Climate change is melting snow and ice, exposing even more garbage and bodies that have been covered for decades on Everest. This waste pollutes the natural environment and poses a severe health risk to everyone who lives in the Everest watershed.Nearly 100 tonnes of garbage were collected during this spring climbing season from Everest and Lhotse, which share the same base camp.According to the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee (SPCC), 77.19 tonnes of waste was collected from the Everest base camp alone during the Spring 2024 climbing season. With 8-9 tonnes coming from the higher camps brought down by the expedition agencies, the SPCC collected 85 tonnes of waste this spring.The breakdown of collected waste shows burnable garbage at 27.99 tonnes, recyclable garbage at 7.51 tonnes, human waste at 27.53 tonnes, and kitchen waste at 14.15 tonnes. The Nepal Army also collected over 11 tonnes of garbage. In Spring 2023, the SPCC managed nearly 70 tonnes of waste from expedition groups.Insiders say the Everest Base Camp has become more luxurious, leading to an accumulation of people and garbage. Nearly 60,000 people trek to the Base Camp annually.Since 2015, the SPCC has enforced the 8 kg garbage rule, requiring every climber ascending the Everest base camp to return with at least 8 kg of garbage. Visitors to Everest must also pay a $4,000 garbage deposit, which is refunded if the person returns with 8 kg.Before this year’s climbing season, the Supreme Court issued a mandamus order directing the government to regulate the rising number of expeditions on the world’s tallest mountain.The court order followed frequent traffic jams and increasing trash on Everest, which has even been called the ‘world's highest garbage dump’.“Drones can replace helicopters as a relatively low-risk transport vehicle to supplement supplies on the plateau, which will greatly expand the application space of UAVs,” Cai Yong, a senior engineer at East China Normal University, told Xinhua, the state news agency of China, after the April test.In recent years, more electric drones have been used in agriculture and forestry, power line inspection, logistics, and emergency rescue, and each breakthrough will help save human and material resources and protect the safety of life and property, Jin Wei, deputy secretary-general of the China UAV Industry Innovation Alliance, told Xinhua.The April tests used the DJI FlyCart 30 to fly three bottles of oxygen and 1.5 kg of other supplies from the base camp to Camp I of the world's highest peak and to carry garbage down on the return trip.During the tests, the DJI FlyCart 30 flew up to 6,191.8 metres on Everest, which straddles the Nepal-China border.  ","summary":"Come autumn, Nepal will deploy heavy lifter drones to transport garbage from the 6,812-metre tall Ama Dablam, south of Everest.

But our sole purpose is to reduce potential deaths in the Khumbu Icefall, the danger zone,” said Bhusal.“We will train Sherpas, as drone operators cannot handle tasks at the higher camps. In the future, all work will be done by Sherpas.” In the trial phase, the drone could lift 30 kg from Camp I. However, its performance dropped to 18 kg from Camp II. “Based on the MoU framework, we will soon sign a commercial agreement with the drone supplier,” said Bhusal. “The municipality will monitor all the activities.”The municipality has, so far, spent Rs800,000 on the trial. Climate change is melting snow and ice, exposing even more garbage and bodies that have been covered for decades on Everest. This waste pollutes the natural environment and poses a severe health risk to everyone who lives in the Everest watershed.Nearly 100 tonnes of garbage were collected during this spring climbing season from Everest and Lhotse, which share the same base camp.According to the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee (SPCC), 77.19 tonnes of waste was collected from the Everest base camp alone during the Spring 2024 climbing season. With 8-9 tonnes coming from the higher camps brought down by the expedition agencies, the SPCC collected 85 tonnes of waste this spring.The breakdown of collected waste shows burnable garbage at 27.99 tonnes, recyclable garbage at 7.51 tonnes, human waste at 27.53 tonnes, and kitchen waste at 14.15 tonnes. The Nepal Army also collected over 11 tonnes of garbage. In Spring 2023, the SPCC managed nearly 70 tonnes of waste from expedition groups.Insiders say the Everest Base Camp has become more luxurious, leading to an accumulation of people and garbage. Nearly 60,000 people trek to the Base Camp annually.Since 2015, the SPCC has enforced the 8 kg garbage rule, requiring every climber ascending the Everest base camp to return with at least 8 kg of garbage. Visitors to Everest must also pay a $4,000 garbage deposit, which is refunded if the person returns with 8 kg.Before this year’s climbing season, the Supreme Court issued a mandamus order directing the government to regulate the rising number of expeditions on the world’s tallest mountain.The court order followed frequent traffic jams and increasing trash on Everest, which has even been called the ‘world's highest garbage dump’.“Drones can replace helicopters as a relatively low-risk transport vehicle to supplement supplies on the plateau, which will greatly expand the application space of UAVs,” Cai Yong, a senior engineer at East China Normal University, told Xinhua, the state news agency of China, after the April test.In recent years, more electric drones have been used in agriculture and forestry, power line inspection, logistics, and emergency rescue, and each breakthrough will help save human and material resources and protect the safety of life and property, Jin Wei, deputy secretary-general of the China UAV Industry Innovation Alliance, told Xinhua.The April tests used the DJI FlyCart 30 to fly three bottles of oxygen and 1.5 kg of other supplies from the base camp to Camp I of the world's highest peak and to carry garbage down on the return trip.During the tests, the DJI FlyCart 30 flew up to 6,191.8 metres on Everest, which straddles the Nepal-China border.  "},{"hash":"d9b69f6747d992752403be55768aa2ea59b2e8c70021311d14addc84617c26bf","title":"congress-general-secretaries-thapa-and-sharma-struggling-to-assert-themselves","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/08/06/congress-general-secretaries-thapa-and-sharma-struggling-to-assert-themselves","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/congress-1722905189.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1722902400000,"source":"kp","category":"politics","content":"In Nepali Congress, the position of general secretary is considered the second most powerful after the party president.Historically, some charismatic leaders have held the position in the country’s grand old party: from Krishna Prasad Bhattarai in the 1950s, to Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, Girija Prasad Koirala, to now the duo of Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma.When two relatively younger and popular leaders—Thapa and Sharma—got elected as general secretaries in December 2021, they had kindled hope among young Congress members and well-wishers of the party.But over time, they have failed to implement their agendas as the establishment led by party chief Deuba is dominant. Political analysts and observers, too, say that Thapa and Sharma have failed to reflect the strength of their popular mandate in the party decision making process.Prior to its 14th general convention, the party had the provision of one elected general secretary whereas the other was nominated by the party President after the general convention. In the last convention, the party amended its statute and made it mandatory to elect both the general secretaries and other party bearers through voting.With Thapa and Sharma elected as the Congress general secretaries, they were expected to challenge the septuagenarian party President Sher Bahadur Deuba.However, as a party insider claims, the general secretary duo themselves are struggling to create their space in party leadership. This struggle is a testament to the challenges they face in cementing their influence in the Congress, says a party leader.“The party’s general secretary is usually occupied with official work,” Prakash Sharan Mahat, a Congress spokesperson, told the Post. “How active they are in the party’s internal affairs is not something I can comment on.”After being elected as the party’s general secretaries, Thapa and Sharma have publicly spoken about being kept in the dark on vital matters. For instance, while speaking at the 42nd BP Memorial programme held on July 20, Thapa said the July 1 agreement between Congress and CPN-UML reached to form a new coalition government came as a surprise.Purushottam Dahal, a senior journalist close to the Congress, says the two general secretaries didn’t understand their exact role.“The general secretary’s role is to make the party’s central secretariat functional, but they are trying to be reactionary, which is inappropriate,” Dahal told the Post. “To make the party functional, they should not wait for a green signal from the party president.”However, General Secretary Sharma rubbishes such a claim.“There have been some transformative changes in the party after we assumed the role of general secretaries,” Sharma told the Post. “From establishing a library in the party’s central office to holding the BP Koirala Literature Festival, we have made the party more vibrant.”He argued that what has happened is that the duo have failed to publicise some of their important works.The general secretaries claim they are facing difficulties because of the party leadership’s working style, but some leaders don’t buy that argument.Sharma further claims that their work is often hindered by the generational gap with Deuba.“In addition, both of us general secretaries were elected from different panels during the general convention, which caused some misunderstanding among party leaders,” Sharma said.But there are other Congress leaders who accuse the general secretaries of suddenly turning risk-averse. “They are bound by the party statute as the party follows a presidential system where the president prevails over others,” Govinda Pokharel, a newly appointed head of the Economic Policy and Planning Department of the Congress, told the Post. “However, the two general secretaries cannot accommodate all groups in the party, and hence their difficulties.” According to Pokharel, after becoming the party’s office bearers, they are slowly turning cautious. “Although they have a very popular base and they also have content-based knowledge on development, they are not being able to use their potential.” Sharma differs.“We have challenged the party leadership on many issues to establish our agenda,” Sharma said. “At the party’s Mahasamiti meeting in February, we successfully proposed contesting the upcoming election with the party’s own strength… The party's central committee meeting, which will commence on Wednesday, will pass our proposal as it is.” A Congress leader close to General Secretary Thapa, however, acknowledged that Thapa is sometimes clueless about the party’s functioning.“From the beginning, the general secretaries have not been able to mobilise the leaders in their fold effectively,” Shankar Tiwari, a Congress youth leader close to Thapa, told the Post. “Sometimes they prevail over the party president, but on many other occasions they are also at his mercy.”Meanwhile, a few Congress leaders claim that the popularity of the general secretaries duo is diminishing, which could make it difficult for them to elevate themselves in party politics in the coming days. There are ample examples where Congress leaders lost their revolutionary spirit after becoming general secretary, says the leader.Only three past general secretaries of Congress have succeeded in becoming party chief and the prime minister. Krishna Prasad Bhattarai was the general secretary of the party soon after the establishment of democracy in Nepal in 1950. Likewise, Girija Prasad Koirala, another general secretary during the 1990s, later became the prime minister as well as the party President. Sushil Koirala was the third general secretary to become party president, and the prime minister. Jagat Nepal, a long-time Congress observer, says that apart from the prime minister, two of the Congress’s general secretaries have become the country’s President, if not party president and prime minister. “Ram Baran Yadav, the first President of the country, and Ramchandra Paudel, the current President, both were once the party’s general secretary,” Nepal told the Post. Besides, Taranath Ranabhat, the former general secretary of the party, and Paudel became Speakers of the House of Representatives in the 1990s.Nepal added that despite not being elevated to the party’s top position, a few former general secretaries of Congress had played an important role in national politics. “We can’t draw a sweeping conclusion that leaders lose their influence after becoming general secretary,” he said.Apart from the leaders mentioned above, Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, Krishna Prasad Sitaula, Prakash Man Singh, Sashank Koirala, and Purna Bahadur Khadka were the few among others who took up the responsibility of the general secretary.“As far as why they were not able to lift themselves to the top position is concerned, sometimes, despite their personal efficiency, circumstances might not be favourable,” Dahal, the senior journalist, said.General Secretary Sharma echoes Dahal.In the past, the party president used to nominate one of the two general secretaries.

The committee had endorsed the bill unanimously on August 8 after considering it for over a year.The bill will see a detailed discussion on Wednesday before it is put to a vote. As the three major parties unanimously passed the bill in the House committee, there is no barrier to its endorsement from the federal parliament. However, not every stakeholder has accepted it. While hailing the bill as progressive, the Conflict Victims Women National (CVWN) Network has expressed its reservations over the classification of crimes, the proposed provision of reduced sentencing and not listing war crimes and crimes against humanity as serious violations of human rights.The bill lists rape or serious cases of sexual violence, intentional or arbitrary killing, enforced disappearances and inhumane or cruel torture as serious violations of human rights and thus non-amnestiable. Other incidents fall as human rights violations and are amnestiable. One of the provisions in the bill clears the way for reconciliation in cases other than serious violations of human rights. The attorney general cannot be forced to press ahead with a legal case in incidents of human rights violations or serious violations of human rights where there has been reconciliation or a recommendation for amnesty, according to the bill.Except in cases of rape or serious sexual violence, there can be a reduction in the sentencing by 75 percent if the perpetrators fulfil some set criteria. Decisions on reduced penalty can be taken after examining whether the perpetrators provide information on the allegations against them, whether they cooperate with the commissions on evidence collection and whether they express remorse for their acts. Similarly, before recommending a reduction in penalty, the commissions need to evaluate whether the perpetrators have apologised to the victims and made commitments to not repeating such acts. “Narrowing down the definition of serious violations of the human rights poses risk that the victims can be deprived of the rights to truth, justice and reparations,” reads a statement from the CVWN.However, another group of victims united under victims and survivors of serious human rights violations have welcomed the bills saying the agreement in the bill has generated hope for justice. They, however, have demanded their participation in the mechanisms for finalising the reparations. Now the focus of the victims should be towards ensuring that the two transitional justice commissions get the right persons to lead them.However, the Accountability Watch Committee, a rights group, has demanded the authorities concerned address serious errors in the bill before it is endorsed by the federal parliament.All disqualified Maoist combatants including child soldiers, along with the families of security personnel who died or got injured during the insurgency, will get reparation and compensation, as per the agreement. However, the issue of child soldiers, which is considered a war crime, along with crimes against humanity and other acts of war crime is not mentioned in the agreement. The rights group has expressed its reservations about the provision as well.Those who have followed the process closely say there is no denying that the present bill is progressive and three parties coming together has given a positive message for its conclusion.“Now how honest the parties are towards concluding the process will be seen through what type of people get appointed to the commissions,” Chiranjibi Bhandari, assistant professor of Conflict, Peace, and Development Studies at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post. “If competent persons with higher social acceptance get to the position, they can take the process ahead finding pragmatic ways.” ","summary":"The bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act has landed in the House of Representatives amid mixed reactions from the victims and human rights activists.Bimala Subedi, chairperson of the Law, Justice, and Human Rights Committee of the House, presented a report on the bill that was endorsed by her panel a week earlier.

While hailing the bill as progressive, the Conflict Victims Women National (CVWN) Network has expressed its reservations over the classification of crimes, the proposed provision of reduced sentencing and not listing war crimes and crimes against humanity as serious violations of human rights.The bill lists rape or serious cases of sexual violence, intentional or arbitrary killing, enforced disappearances and inhumane or cruel torture as serious violations of human rights and thus non-amnestiable. Other incidents fall as human rights violations and are amnestiable. One of the provisions in the bill clears the way for reconciliation in cases other than serious violations of human rights. The attorney general cannot be forced to press ahead with a legal case in incidents of human rights violations or serious violations of human rights where there has been reconciliation or a recommendation for amnesty, according to the bill.Except in cases of rape or serious sexual violence, there can be a reduction in the sentencing by 75 percent if the perpetrators fulfil some set criteria. Decisions on reduced penalty can be taken after examining whether the perpetrators provide information on the allegations against them, whether they cooperate with the commissions on evidence collection and whether they express remorse for their acts. Similarly, before recommending a reduction in penalty, the commissions need to evaluate whether the perpetrators have apologised to the victims and made commitments to not repeating such acts. “Narrowing down the definition of serious violations of the human rights poses risk that the victims can be deprived of the rights to truth, justice and reparations,” reads a statement from the CVWN.However, another group of victims united under victims and survivors of serious human rights violations have welcomed the bills saying the agreement in the bill has generated hope for justice. They, however, have demanded their participation in the mechanisms for finalising the reparations. Now the focus of the victims should be towards ensuring that the two transitional justice commissions get the right persons to lead them.However, the Accountability Watch Committee, a rights group, has demanded the authorities concerned address serious errors in the bill before it is endorsed by the federal parliament.All disqualified Maoist combatants including child soldiers, along with the families of security personnel who died or got injured during the insurgency, will get reparation and compensation, as per the agreement. However, the issue of child soldiers, which is considered a war crime, along with crimes against humanity and other acts of war crime is not mentioned in the agreement. The rights group has expressed its reservations about the provision as well.Those who have followed the process closely say there is no denying that the present bill is progressive and three parties coming together has given a positive message for its conclusion.“Now how honest the parties are towards concluding the process will be seen through what type of people get appointed to the commissions,” Chiranjibi Bhandari, assistant professor of Conflict, Peace, and Development Studies at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post. “If competent persons with higher social acceptance get to the position, they can take the process ahead finding pragmatic ways.” "},{"hash":"fbe35942ec9382e438c94d36d8b6edcdf27ad1b758baa000cd66aa9b5820437d","title":"chairman-dahal-faces-unprecedented-challenge-in-party","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/08/13/chairman-dahal-faces-unprecedented-challenge-in-party","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/Dahal-1723508971.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1723507200000,"source":"kp","category":"politics","content":"Internal strife is not unusual in political parties, and the CPN (Maoist Centre) is no exception. However, the party’s standing committee meeting, which started on August 9 in Kathmandu, saw a notable twist. Party office bearers have demanded that the party leadership make way for the new generation.“I have been attending party meetings for a long time, but never before have leaders openly pushed for a change in leadership,” a leader present in the meeting told the Post requesting anonymity. On the first day of the meeting, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal presented a verbal proposal on the current political affairs, party development and other pertinent issues. After Dahal’s speech, many leaders questioned the party’s policies and leadership. Among them, Janardan Sharma, a deputy general secretary of the party, submitted a written proposal on August 10, calling for a review of Dahal’s leadership and suggesting that the party chair be demoted to a ceremonial role as patron. Likewise, Barshaman Pun, another deputy general secretary of the party, called for setting a clear deadline before the transition to new leadership. “No one should stay as party chief forever, now let’s set a term limit for the next leadership,” the standing committee member told the Post, quoting Pun. The leader also told the Post that in the past, when Babaram Bhattarai and Mohan Baidya were part of the party leadership and had disagreements, they never asked Dahal to step down. However, this time Deputy General Secretary Sharma has openly asked Dahal to do so.“We can sense that Dahal is under pressure, as party leaders are openly challenging his leadership,” another Maoist Centre standing committee member, who is also the Bagmati provincial assembly member, told the Post. Party spokesman Agni Sapkota denies any such pressure on the leadership. “It is true that the ongoing standing committee meeting is discussing new leadership, but there is no internal strife,” he told the Post.Maoist Centre chair Dahal has long been navigating internal conflicts, manoeuvring between them to bolster his position. Earlier, when Bhattarai and Baidya were in the party, Dahal used to play one against the other to maintain control. “This time, with deputy general secretaries Sharma and Pun, two of the strongest figures, openly challenging him, Dahal is in trouble,” another Maoist Centre leader told the Post.Sharma leads the Maoist Centre’s Rukum district organisation and Pun heads Rolpa. These two district organisations are among the strongest in the party. In the past, Dahal always used Rukum and Rolpa against each other whenever he was in trouble, but now that they have united, his old tactics will be ineffective, the leader added. With all the party leaders under scrutiny, the leadership itself is also being questioned, says Yubraj Chaulagain, a leader of the party. “However, the issues raised will be addressed by the leadership, as our party is mature enough to handle internal disputes and their potential outcomes,” Chaulagain told the Post.There are some problems in the party, but they are manageable, says Ram Karki, a standing committee member of the party.“These proposals [of the two deputy general secretaries] have gained some traction among standing committee members, but they alone won’t be enough to change the party leadership,” Karki told the Post. There are some theoretical ambiguities in communist parties on leadership transfer, Karki said. “Communist parties have traditionally practised person-centric leadership under the pretext of strengthening it,” Karki said. “This only brings more difficulties.”“Internal discussions in the Maoist Centre got a lot of hype this time, particularly because the leaders who previously refrained from criticising the leadership are now openly doing so. But for those of us in the party, this is nothing new,” Karki said. Many leaders at the standing committee meeting criticised the party’s weaknesses and Dahal’s leadership. They argued that current party policies are failing to garner public support and called for a change, according to the standing committee leader. However, not all of those speaking at the meeting were critical of Dahal. Those supporting him did not acknowledge any flaws in the current party policies or in Dahal’s leadership. Party Secretary Ganesh Shah says party leadership is not in as much trouble as the media suggests. He explained that individual leaders have their own styles of expression. “Some leaders may have appeared stern in the meeting, but there are no issues,” claims Shah. “In the Maoist Centre, there is a tendency to publicly criticise the leadership by day and resolve issues behind closed doors by night. I don’t expect things to be any different this time,” Shah told the Post. Based on discussions within the party, Karki suggests that while there has been some speculation about a potential split, the likelihood is low. “If a split were imminent, the discussions would be focused on ideological and political issues, but that is not the case now.” After the party was removed from government on July 12, the Maoist Centre has been focussed on strengthening the party. It has also vowed to contest the next general elections on its own strength, without forging any electoral alliances. The Maoist Centre standing committee meeting started on August 9 and will continue until August 14. As of Monday, 32 out of 44 standing committee members have spoken.

I demand that this Central Committee meeting make a decision ensuring the next general convention is held in December next year,” said Koirala. The Congress has a history of delaying its general conventions. As per the party charter, the Congress should hold its periodic general convention every four years. The 13th general convention that elected Sher Bahadur Deuba as party president was held in March 2016. Going by the party statute, the convention must have been held by March 2020. Owing to internal differences and citing the domestic political situation, the party postponed the event by a year and a half. The 14th national convention was held only in December 2021, which reelected Deuba as party president.The party’s statute allows an extension of the convention by a year, and the Constitution of Nepal also envisions that political parties hold their conventions every five years. Article 269 (4) (b) of the constitution requires a political party to hold its general convention at least once every five years. In special circumstances, the constitution allows postponement of the event for a maximum of six months.The party leadership made the maximum extension allowed before holding its 14th general convention.Fearing that Deuba could repeat the history, the Koirala faction wants a formal decision to stick to the party charter’s four-year gap between two conventions. Putting his views in the meeting, Ajaya Babu Shiwakoti, a central committee member, demanded the ongoing meeting come up with a concrete schedule for the next general convention.Seemingly dissatisfied, party president Deuba, interrupted Koirala, and asserted that the general convention would be held on time and there was no plan to postpone it, according to a leader present in the meeting.Koirala, who is an aspirant for party presidency, not only wanted assurance for the timely convention but also criticised the performance of the party leadership in his 10-point comments.“I am not here to analyse the role the Congress played in national politics under your leadership in the last eight years,” he said. “Election results have clearly shown that the party’s base has shrunk. I leave it to history to objectively assess why the Congress fared poorly in earlier elections, and though it is the largest party in parliament now, it is only due to the electoral alliance.” The Congress came in second after the CPN-UML in the 2017 general election. In the 2022 elections, the party forged an electoral alliance with the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the CPN (Unified Socialist). With 88 seats, the Congress is the largest party in the lower house, though it trailed behind the UML in popular votes.Koirala used the party meeting as a platform to criticise the performance of the incumbent Congress-UML alliance. “The Congress and the UML have repeatedly promised good governance when forming governments. However, their selection of ministers at the federal level and in provinces has made a mockery of good governance,” he said.He suggested that the incumbent alliance of the big parties work towards equipping the provinces with the constitutional authority that they have yet to enjoy even nine years after the promulgation of the statute. “The provinces are struggling to prove their relevance in lack of fiscal and administrative federalism. The two major parties must work to resolve the problems facing the provinces,” he said.Stating that mentioning good governance in party documents is meaningless as long as people don’t feel it, he said, “If our friends in the government cannot win the hearts of people through their works, I see the unexpected downfall of the party in the days to come.” ","summary":"More than a year before the scheduled general convention, the dissident faction within the Nepali Congress has started exerting pressure on the leadership for a timely jamboree, as it has a history of not sticking by the party charter for the national gathering.Addressing the party’s Central Working Committee meeting on Sunday, party leader Shekhar Koirala drew the attention of the establishment faction to ensure the party’s 15th general convention is not delayed. “I request that the 15th general convention not be prolonged under any pretext.

President Paudel also said that Nepal and India have had a relationship from the time immemorial and acknowledged India’s big contribution to Nepal’s development. President Paudel mentioned that there is a lot of potential for hydropower development, sustainable and easy energy trade in Nepal.On the occasion, Indian Foreign Secretary Misri expressed his commitment to working together with Nepal as the issue of reducing the impact of climate change is a challenge for both the countries, says Pokharel.Quoting Misri, Pokharel further said, “Among the plans of the Nepal government, India would like to work on Nepal’s priorities such as energy, agriculture and tourism.”The visiting Indian foreign secretary also paid a courtesy call on Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Sunday at Singha Durbar. During their meeting various matters of mutual interest were discussed, says the foreign ministry of Nepal. A source at the Prime Minister’s Office said that during the meeting Prime Minister Oli strongly urged that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi should soon visit Nepal. He also extended a formal invitation. Earlier, Indian Prime Minister Modi was expected to come to Nepal on one of the Mondays of Shawan to pay homage to Lord Pashupatinath. But that window closes in five days.During his first and second tenures, Indian Prime Minister Modi visited Nepal five times in total. After the Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition got the majority in the 14th Lok Sabha election in June, Modi was appointed the prime minister of India for the third time. While Modi first became the prime minister in 2014, Oli became the prime minister of Nepal in 2015. During the second tenure of Modi, which started in 2019, Oli was against the prime minister, following the 2017 elections. Relations between the two countries are at present considered to be at a low, according to experts.Earlier in 2018, Indian Prime Minister Modi had visited Nepal at the invitation of Oli the prime minister.This is a familiarisation visit of Secretary Misri, said spokesperson for the foreign ministry in Kathmandu Amrit Rai. “Therefore, no issues other than those of bilateral interest were discussed.”However, Rai refused to categorically mention the issues of mutual interest.

He is scheduled to attend the sixth summit of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) starting September 4.Nepal and Thailand are also working to make Prime Minister Oli’s visit bilateral. After Thailand, Prime Minister Oli will take part in the 79th session of the United National General Assembly in September. The Prime Minister’s Office claimed that both India and China had invited Prime Minister Oli. Indian Foreign Secretary Misri, apart from President Paudel and Prime Minister Oli, also met Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba at his residence in Budhanilkantha. Among other things, they discussed ways to strengthen bilateral relations, according to a press release issued after the meeting.Also on Sunday Misri also paid a courtesy call on CPN (Maoist Centre) chair and former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. During the meeting both sides discussed issues of mutual interest, said Dahal’s personal secretary Ramesh Malla.“Since it was an introductory visit, the discussion was casual,” Malla told the Post. The visiting foreign secretary reportedly vowed to work on the agreement reached between the two countries when Dahal was the prime minister.When Dahal visited India as the prime minister of Nepal in June 2023, India had agreed to import 10,000 MW of hydroelectricity from Nepal.Indian Secretary Misri came to Kathmandu on a two-day visit at the invitation of Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal. Misri was welcomed by his Nepali counterpart Lamsal at the Tribhuvan International Airport.Misri took up his new role last month, succeeding Vinay Mohan Kwatra, who served as Indian ambassador to Nepal from March 2020 to April 2022. Misri undertook his first familiarisation visit, to Bhutan, on July 18.Foreign ministry officials said that it is customary for new foreign secretaries to tour South Asian countries after assuming office to update themselves and assess bilateral relations.

Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” ","summary":"The rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers.

While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesn’t just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. “They need options that won’t affect their income; a crackdown won’t work.”Dawadi emphasises that KMC shouldn’t view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure ‘disabled-friendly.’ Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. “People with disabilities should be involved in planning,” she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.“On many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,” he explains. “The footpath has become just a showpiece.”Rishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmandu’s footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministry’s Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMC’s recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishi’s organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.“The constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,” Adhikari said. “Forget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.”Rishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, “forcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.” This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.“Despite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,” Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. “This reflects a major failure of the state’s duty,” he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the country’s road infrastructure. “We don’t know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,” she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. “Without clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, it’s hard for us to find our destinations,” Ray says. “As I can’t hear, I rely on signs for guidance.”Ray also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. “Crossing the road can be chaotic,” he notes. “With drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.”Ray was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didn’t suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMC’s new footpaths and railings are a step forward but “they are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.”According to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term ‘disabled-friendly’ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an ‘inclusivity checklist’ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. “What about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?” he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. “There’s no guidance or facilities for us,” she said.Shrestha criticises the KMC’s approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. “Construction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,” he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. “While we’re committed to making footpaths accessible, we’re not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,” he said.“We’ve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we can’t address every issue alone.”Baburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. “We are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,” he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.“We’ve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmandu’s pavements and roads, but that doesn’t mean they’re not problematic,” Kumal says. “Accessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.” ","summary":"In Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions.

For months, dairy farmers have been waiting for the government to make both state-owned and private dairies liable to pay their dues. Since December, the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation and private dairies have not paid farmers, and according to rough estimates by the National Peasants' Coalition Nepal, a group of farmers, the dues have now piled up to Rs6.5 billion. Most farmers pay their children’s school fees, hospital bills, and food bills with their income from selling milk. Some of their earnings go to buying animal fodder.“The government changed, but the issues have not been resolved,” said Ganesh Chandra Timilsina, coordinator of the National Peasants' Coalition Nepal. “Farmers will make a last-ditch effort now. They will hit the streets.”“The total dues now amount to Rs6.5 billion, even after farmers have received partial payment.”Farmers are holding a meeting on August 19 to announce various protest programmes. “Since it’s a new government, we decided to wait if it could address our grievances,” said Timilsina.The issue has been raised in Parliament, too. On Tuesday, lawmaker Gagan Thapa said the government would soon release Rs600 million to the DDC to pay the farmers. Thapa’s party, Nepali Congress, is the biggest partner in the KP Sharma Oli-led coalition.“It’s a good beginning for the new government. But the government should also realise that problems will recur, particularly in the dairy sector,” Thapa told the House of Representatives.He said that the Agriculture and Industry ministers should discuss exporting milk to Bangladesh and China. If Nepal is able to export milk to these countries, farmers can get better prices.Ramnath Adhikari, minister for agriculture and livestock development, has asked the farmers’ group to wait for 10–15 days more. The farmers' group met with the agriculture minister last Friday. “We don’t have much hope from the minister as well,” said Timilsina, adding that they have received lofty promises from several governments, but their issues remain unresolved.Former agriculture minister Jwala Kumari Sah, too, had promised to address the issue.The private dairy associations say their dues to farmers have reached over Rs2 billion.Prahlad Dahal, president of the Nepal Dairy Association, said they (private dairy) owe Rs2 billion to the farmers. “There are rumours in the market that we owe farmers Rs4.5 billion. It’s not true.”“We have been paying the farmers partially.”He said that the demand for dairy products has grown. “We are not able to pay farmers the whole sum. We are gradually clearing their dues,” said Dahal.“As big dairies fail to pay the farmers, the amount has become bigger.”On March 4, three private dairy associations—Central Dairy Cooperatives Association, Nepal Dairy Association, and Dairy Industry Association—the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development had signed a trilateral agreement to pay farmers' their dues by April 3.Dairy farmers, however, said there were no representatives from their side during its signing.However, the government failed to commit to requiring the dairy associations to pay the farmers' dues.According to the dairy association, the state-owned dairy supplier covers 30 percent of Nepal’s dairy market, and the rest is catered by private dairies. Private dairies have around 2,000 tonnes of butter in stock. Nearly 3,000 tonnes of milk, valued at Rs90 million, arrives in the market daily across the country through private and state-owned diaries.The informal milk trade—from farmers to customers—is even bigger.Surya Prasad Paudel, general manager of the Dairy Development Corporation, said that the corporation has 750 tonnes of butter and 850 tonnes of powdered milk in stock.“We requested a loan of Rs600 million with the agriculture ministry a few months ago, but we have not received it yet.

The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.At least 50 people from four districts—38 in Lalitpur, eight in Kailali, and two each in Kathmandu and Pyuthan districts—have contracted cholera so far this year. Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients.Public health experts said that detected cases of cholera infection could be just a tip of the iceberg, as most of the positive cases are being reported from the districts having active surveillance, including the three districts of the Kathmandu Valley and Kailali.Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s wards 11, 12, and 13, which were highly affected by the outbreak. Vaccines against the deadly disease were administered in Kapilvastu and Rautahat districts in the past after all efforts to contain the spread of the disease failed.Health officials concede that even if they have discussed the issue of inoculating people from the disease hit areas with anti cholera vaccine, it is easier said than done. They said that finding an anti-cholera vaccine is challenging, as production of the vaccine itself is very low. Moreover, the government has not allocated a budget for the programme.“We have also talked with representatives of the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI), which provides vaccines free of cost to Nepal,” Ghimire said. “But they told us that the chance of supplying vaccines in the near future is low. We have to prepare for cholera vaccination for next year.”Cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season are not a new thing in Nepal, as hundreds of people throughout the country suffer from diarrhoeal infections that continue for months every year and scores contract the disease.In 2022, a total of 77 cholera cases were confirmed in the Valley.Public health experts say that due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, the country as a whole is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.They say sheer negligence from authorities concerned is responsible for ongoing outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases including the deadly cholera.Health authorities in most local units had stopped the testing of drinking water just before the start of the monsoon season, citing lack of funds, although deadly microbes such as faecal coliform and E coli were frequently detected in drinking water samples.Most of the water sources contaminated with deadly microbesOfficials at the Health Office, Lalitpur said that contamination of most of the sources of water—tap water, ground water, tanker water—is a main challenge to contain the spread of the cholera.“We have yet to check the quality of the jar water, which is widely used in offices, hotels and homes for drinking,” said Dr Bhuwan Paudel, chief of Health Office, Lalitpur. “But faecal coliform has been found in most of the samples of tap water, ground water and tanker water being used in Lalitpur.”Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, is found in human faeces. According to doctors, the presence of faecal coliform in drinking water means it is contaminated with sewage.Doctors say bottled water, which is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley, is generally considered safe, but water quality of several companies have been found questionable. Dangerous microbes are detected in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.They say consumption of contaminated water not only can cause diarrhoeal infections and deadly cholera but also increases the risk of contracting dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.They stress that awareness drives and ensuring safe drinking water are crucial to protect people from water-borne diseases.A combination of careful surveys, provision of safe drinking water, good sanitation and hygiene standards, social mobilisation and treatment is required to contain the spread of infection, according to doctors.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.To contain the spread of the infection, a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required, according to experts.The World Health Organisation has also said that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths.

But doctors and experts, including virologists and officials at the Ministry of Health and Population, say cases of coronavirus in the country are steadily ticking up.“We won’t know the situation in communities without testing,” said Dr Janak Koirala, an infectious disease expert. “But what is true is that the number of people suffering from fever, sore throat, body aches and common cold have risen of late and some might be due to Covid.”The World Health Organisation’s report on integrated influenza and other respiratory virus surveillance for week 31 report of 2024 shows SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate of 13.68 percent.Also the latest data of the National Public Health Laboratory indicates a sharp increase in cases. Out of 5,373 tests conducted since January, 341 came out positive for Covid. The test positivity rate is 6.3 percent, which is concerning, according to experts.“Precaution should be taken if the positivity rate exceeds five percent,” said Koirala. “But we don’t know the actual condition, as neither testing nor active case finding are being conducted.”Besides the surge in coronavirus cases, coinfection of multiple viruses including coronavirus has also been detected, according to the lab report.The report shows that swab samples of 11 people having influenza-like symptoms were found to have been infected with A(H1N1) also known as swine flu, and Covid. One sample was found to have co-infection of influenza B virus and Covid. Along with Covid, influenza positivity rate is also on an upward trend. The NPHL’s report shows that the overall influenza positivity rate is 17.1 percent, meaning that 17 out of every 100 samples tested positive for influenza viruses. Specifically, 713 people tested positive for swine flu, 47 for A(H3), also known as Hong Kong flu, and 223 for influenza B virus. Since the end of the second wave of Covid in 2021, health authorities across Nepal have stopped active case finding, including contact tracing and free testing. Hospitals now only conduct tests for those seeking polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for travel abroad or for seriously ill patients with respiratory conditions. Multiple doctors the Post spoke with said that the circulation of coronavirus has never stopped and will not stop in coming days either.Infectious disease experts and virologists urge the public to take precautions to protect the elderly and people with comorbidity from the deadly virus. “Testing and other preventive measures have stopped,” an official at the Health Ministry said, asking not to be named, as he is not authorised to speak on the issue. “But just look around: in our homes and neighbourhood, we can easily find cases of fever, common cold and people with other Covid-like symptoms.”Experts say that even if people are not getting severe from Covid infection, the elderly and people with underlying conditions remain at high risk.“We saw elderly people requiring intensive care during the previous surge in April,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “It’s time to return to basics—washing hands, wearing face masks, avoiding crowds—in order to save at-risk groups like the elderly and those with underlying conditions.”Experts say the overall high positivity rate suggests the virus has spread faster than expected. There could be many people with Covid who have not gone for tests, according to them.As the coronavirus symptoms are similar to those of seasonal flu, many opt not to get tested, which doctors say could prove costly, because they can be carriers and could spread the virus to those coming in contact.Doctors warn that authorities’ reactive approach—taking preventive measures only after hospitals start witnessing massive patient flow could result in more severe consequences.Meanwhile, a highly placed source at the Health Ministry confirmed detection of a new sub-variant of the coronavirus in the country apart from previous variants including the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4.The National Public Health Laboratory had recently carried out whole-genome sequencing on swab samples of 42 coronavirus-infected persons. The report is expected to be published on Tuesday.Whole-genome sequencing is a comprehensive method of analysing the entire DNA sequence of an organism’s genes. Researchers believe whole-genome sequencing of coronavirus could be instrumental in tracking the virus’s severity and properties.“The trend of previous years shows infection of influenza virus including coronavirus surge in August and September,” said Dr Ranjan Bhatta, director at the NPHL. “This surge has been seen in recent days as well. But this does not mean you should panic, only that you should take enough precautions against the risk.” ","summary":"Although the extent of coronavirus spread in communities remains unclear, neither health authorities nor the public see a need for more testing. But doctors and experts, including virologists and officials at the Ministry of Health and Population, say cases of coronavirus in the country are steadily ticking up.“We won’t know the situation in communities without testing,” said Dr Janak Koirala, an infectious disease expert. “But what is true is that the number of people suffering from fever, sore throat, body aches and common cold have risen of late and some might be due to Covid.”The World Health Organisation’s report on integrated influenza and other respiratory virus surveillance for week 31 report of 2024 shows SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate of 13.68 percent.Also the latest data of the National Public Health Laboratory indicates a sharp increase in cases. Out of 5,373 tests conducted since January, 341 came out positive for Covid. The test positivity rate is 6.3 percent, which is concerning, according to experts.“Precaution should be taken if the positivity rate exceeds five percent,” said Koirala. “But we don’t know the actual condition, as neither testing nor active case finding are being conducted.”Besides the surge in coronavirus cases, coinfection of multiple viruses including coronavirus has also been detected, according to the lab report.The report shows that swab samples of 11 people having influenza-like symptoms were found to have been infected with A(H1N1) also known as swine flu, and Covid. One sample was found to have co-infection of influenza B virus and Covid. Along with Covid, influenza positivity rate is also on an upward trend. The NPHL’s report shows that the overall influenza positivity rate is 17.1 percent, meaning that 17 out of every 100 samples tested positive for influenza viruses. Specifically, 713 people tested positive for swine flu, 47 for A(H3), also known as Hong Kong flu, and 223 for influenza B virus. Since the end of the second wave of Covid in 2021, health authorities across Nepal have stopped active case finding, including contact tracing and free testing. Hospitals now only conduct tests for those seeking polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for travel abroad or for seriously ill patients with respiratory conditions. Multiple doctors the Post spoke with said that the circulation of coronavirus has never stopped and will not stop in coming days either.Infectious disease experts and virologists urge the public to take precautions to protect the elderly and people with comorbidity from the deadly virus. “Testing and other preventive measures have stopped,” an official at the Health Ministry said, asking not to be named, as he is not authorised to speak on the issue. “But just look around: in our homes and neighbourhood, we can easily find cases of fever, common cold and people with other Covid-like symptoms.”Experts say that even if people are not getting severe from Covid infection, the elderly and people with underlying conditions remain at high risk.“We saw elderly people requiring intensive care during the previous surge in April,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “It’s time to return to basics—washing hands, wearing face masks, avoiding crowds—in order to save at-risk groups like the elderly and those with underlying conditions.”Experts say the overall high positivity rate suggests the virus has spread faster than expected. There could be many people with Covid who have not gone for tests, according to them.As the coronavirus symptoms are similar to those of seasonal flu, many opt not to get tested, which doctors say could prove costly, because they can be carriers and could spread the virus to those coming in contact.Doctors warn that authorities’ reactive approach—taking preventive measures only after hospitals start witnessing massive patient flow could result in more severe consequences.Meanwhile, a highly placed source at the Health Ministry confirmed detection of a new sub-variant of the coronavirus in the country apart from previous variants including the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4.The National Public Health Laboratory had recently carried out whole-genome sequencing on swab samples of 42 coronavirus-infected persons. The report is expected to be published on Tuesday.Whole-genome sequencing is a comprehensive method of analysing the entire DNA sequence of an organism’s genes. Researchers believe whole-genome sequencing of coronavirus could be instrumental in tracking the virus’s severity and properties.“The trend of previous years shows infection of influenza virus including coronavirus surge in August and September,” said Dr Ranjan Bhatta, director at the NPHL. “This surge has been seen in recent days as well. But this does not mean you should panic, only that you should take enough precautions against the risk.” "},{"hash":"4d702befaca379d2fa9f94f08ef49dfa9fda6a0d7a44b163a88923797b8ac70e","title":"dhulikhel-hospital-launches-new-training-to-boost-staff-communication-and-behaviour","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/health/2024/08/12/dhulikhel-hospital-launches-new-training-to-boost-staff-communication-and-behaviour","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/Picture1-1723423084.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1723420800000,"source":"kp","category":"health","content":"At the Dhulikhel Hospital in Kavrepalanchok, the suggestion box is overflowing with complaints of rude behaviour.People are unhappy not only with doctors, nurses and paramedics serving at the hospital, but also with security guards, administrative staff and those manning the hospital’s ticket counter.“Sometimes, the behaviour of health workers and other staffers towards patients and their visitors escalates and leads to conflicts,” said Dr Biraj Karmacharya, administrative head of the Hospital. “The issue is not just the complaints made by the patients and their visitors, hospital officials have also noticed behavioural problems among health workers and other staffers.”To address growing complaints from patients and visitors, the hospital administration has decided to impart behavioural and communication skills training to its entire staffers, including doctors, nurses, paramedics and others.Officials hope this training will help lessen the growing grievances.“Proper communication and good behaviour are essential for all hospital staff including doctors,” said Dr Karmacharya. “These skills are also taught in universities and medical courses, but it seems some health workers have not paid much attention to these basics.

The presence of faecal coliform indicates that the drinking water being used by the residents of Thaiba in Godawari Municipality in Lalitpur is contaminated with sewage, according to doctors.Of the 30 cholera cases reported from across the country, 19 were from various areas of Lalitpur and the remaining from Kailali (8), Kathmandu (1) and Pyuthan (2).Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, leading to dehydration and or even death within a few hours if untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient.Faecal coliform had also been detected in the study carried out on water samples collected from Godawari Municipality before the onset of monsoon.As the monsoon is an epidemic season, when most drinking water sources become contaminated due to flooding, presence of deadly microbes—E coli and faecal coliform—in drinking water is not unusual, health officials say. Even jar water, which is generally considered safer compared to water from other sources, often gets contaminated during the monsoon season.What concerns officials most is the apathy of the responsible agencies in launching awareness drives about the risks and other preventive measures. Most local authorities across the country halted testing of drinking water just before the start of monsoon citing budget constraints.Officials at the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL) said that it is the responsibility of consumers themselves to ensure that water is safe before drinking, as the utility cannot guarantee the safety of drinking from every tap.“We request consumers to boil water properly before drinking, as water gets contaminated during the monsoon season due to leakage in pipes and mixing of drainage and rainwater,” said Sailaja Acharya, assistant manager of the KUKL. “We have increased the level of chlorine at the treatment plant and in reservoirs, but water could get contaminated when it reaches household taps.”The KUKL has started supplying water from the Bagmati river to household taps after supply from the Melamchi River was halted.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it.

But our investment and preparation for the Olympics and other international events are woefully inadequate,” said former Olympican Deepak Bista, who currently serves as the president of Nepal Olympians Association and the director of national team preparation, at the National Sports Council. “There are no proper venues for players to train and practice, So how do you compete against elite athletes from around the world?” Athlete Santoshi Shrestha completed the difficult 41.195km track of the women’s marathon event in the 79th position out of 91 athletes. Her timing of 2 hours 55 minutes and 06 seconds was far from her previous best and national record of 2 hours 46 minutes and 23 seconds, which she set on the way to marathon debut gold at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Dhaka Marathon earlier this year.After the women’s marathon, Santoshi said she could have set a new national record in Paris had she pushed herself more in an endurance-testing track, but she chose not to because of fear of possible injury.“I could not take the risk because the track was very steep after 15 km. I was comfortable and could have made a new record there [in Paris] but I chose to stay in the comfort zone. I want to compete in other tournaments as well,” said Santoshi.But Santoshi’s story could have been different had her preparations and training back home been better. “Further, players, coaches and team management all need to work hard with complete focus and dedication all round the year if they are to bring medals. Sadly, the state of our players is not good enough. They are compelled to find other jobs so that they can look after their families. How can we expect them to win medals at big tournaments?” added Bista, who was the second Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, Beijing 2008.“The players need physical, mental and financial support.”Former Nepali Olympian Sangina Baidya also points to poor investment and preparation in sports for Nepal’s underperformance at the Olympics.“There is a lack of extensive investment in sports infrastructures. The state should be interested in the development of sports. If there is sufficient investment at the youth level, and they get substantial funding, resources and infractures, they can undoubtedly perform better in the international competitions including the Olympics,” said taekwondo practitioner Baidya, who was the first Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, in Athens 2004, through a selection tournament.“In comparison to other successful countries, here in Nepal, preparations for the Olympics start late. They get only a few months of training, which is not enough,” she added.Judoka Manita Shrestha Pradhan has a similar story. She got a training room only two months before the Olympics and she was still expected to win at least one or two bouts in Paris—which is a lot to ask for. Shrestha Pradhan could not progress beyond the first round of women’s 57 kg weight category event.There is no targeted budget for the Olympics programme despite the sports sector getting Rs3.5 billion for the fiscal year 2024/25. Only Rs9 million was allocated for the transport, lodging and food of athletes and officials participating in the Paris Olympics and Paralympics.The Nepal Olympic Committee provides $750 per person to the 10 athletes of the 10 sports under the International Olympic Committee’s Solidarity scholarship, which is insufficient. Swimmers Alexander Shah and Duana Lama trained abroad, in the United States and Thailand, respectively, but the scholarship amount was not enough for them to train at top-class facilities. Lama finished last in her Heat and 30th overall in women’s 200m freestyle.Shah, who was competing at the Olympics for a second consecutive time, will at least return home with some joy. His 51.91 seconds in the men’s 100m freestyle Heat shattered his own previous national record of 52.17 seconds set during the World Aquatic Championship in Doha, Qatar.Badminton star Prince Dahal trained in Sri Lanka and had to travel to Paris 2024 without a coach as Nepali authorities did not send the name of the coach for accreditation and visa process on time.Prince Dahal could not win a single match in the men’s singles group stage. Shooter Sushmita Nepal finished 42nd in the women’s 10m air rifle qualification event. Table tennis player Santoo Shrestha also exited the Olympics from the men’s singles preliminary round.But big investment in sports may not always do the trick.Santoo Shrestha, who competed in the men’s singles table tennis at Paris Olympics, was the only third player in Nepal’s Olympic history to qualify for the Olympics through the selection stage—which is a perfect demonstration of how poor the country is technically.Take Jamaica and Kenya. Athletes in these countries are highly successful in athletics.Jamaica—the home of sprinter Usian Bolt, eight time Olympic gold medallist and world record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 4 × 100 metres relay—has won a total of 87 medals at the Olympics. Of them 86 have come from track and field.Kenya is the most successful African country at the Olympics, with a total of 124 medals so far. Of them 117 are from track and field and seven from boxing.Ethiopia is another nation which focuses on long-distance events. Their total of 58 Olympic medals have all come in long-distance events in athletics.India was once a dominant country in field hockey and won a record 11 Olympic medals, including eight golds between 1928 and 1980. Although the country experienced a drought in hockey medals, the sport is gradually finding new success after its team picked two consecutive hockey bronze medals in Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024. Wrestling and shooting are the other sports Indian athletes specialise in.“The government should learn from how other countries prepare their athletes,” said Bista, suggesting that Nepal should target some sports for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and prepare accordingly.Nepal has won a total of 26 medals at the Asian Games. Of them, it has bagged 24 medals in martial arts, which include karate (4), taekwondo (14) and boxing (6). “Nepal should select sports in which Nepal is historically good, for instance martial arts. After that, the government should allocate a significant budget just for the Olympics programme and train the players from the beginning if it expects our athletes to do better,” Bista added.Technically, Nepal’s only medal at the Olympics came in 1988 in Seoul when Bidhan Lama won a bronze medal in the men’s 50kg weight category taekwondo competition. But his medal was counted as unofficial as the sport was then an exhibition event. Taekwondo entered the Olympics programme only at Sydney 2000.But the 2026 Asian Games in Aichi-Nagoya, Japan could be a head start.The National Sports Council has launched Mission 2026 as part of the preparations for the next Asiad and has targeted at least 10 medals. But, sadly, the government has only approved Rs20 million for the programme.“We don’t have enough funding for the programme. This amount will support our athletes for only five to six months. It is unfortunate that the government could not embrace the NSC’s mission.” Bista said, adding that he fears Mission 2026 will just be an ambitious dream.But Bista hopes Palesha Goverdhan may change history despite the odds. Goverdhan became the first Nepali paralympian to pass the selection stage when she qualified for the Paris Paralympics. She won a gold medal in the Asian Qualifiers in China.Govardhan also won a bronze at the 2022 Asian Para Games, becoming the first Nepali para athlete to win a medal at the event.“Palesha is training in London under one of the best trainers,” said Bista who added that the NSC is paying her training fees.

It is a direct risk to the economy,” said Nuttachart Mekmasin, a strategist at Trinity Securities, outlining key policies including a 500 billion baht ($14.3 billion) cash handout plan may be stalled.“Consumer and business confidence will be affected,” he said, “Spending and investment will slow down until the next government is formed.”The government has estimated growth of just 2.7% for 2024, lagging regional peers, while Thailand has been among Asia's worst-performing markets.The index slipped 1.29% after the court decision, before recovering to close 0.4% down.UNCERTAIN TRUCESrettha's Pheu Thai Party and its predecessors have borne the brunt of Thailand's turmoil, with two of its governments removed by coups in a long-running grudge match between the party's founders, the billionaire Shinawatra family, and their rivals in the conservative establishment and royalist military.“I am saddened to leave as a prime minister who was found to be unethical,” Srettha told reporters at Government House, adding it was possible the new government could change his policies.“I performed my duties with integrity and honesty.”Deputy premier Phumtham Wechayachai is expected to take over as caretaker prime minister.The ruling could rock a fragile truce between political heavyweight Thaksin Shinawatra and his enemies among the conservative elite and military old guard, which enabled the tycoon’s return from 15 years of self-exile in 2023 and ally Srettha to become premier the same day.Srettha had maintained his appointment of former Shinawatra lawyer Pichit Chuenban, who was briefly imprisoned for contempt of court in 2008 over an alleged attempt to bribe court staff, was above board.

It is a direct risk to the economy,” said Nuttachart Mekmasin, a strategist at Trinity Securities, outlining key policies including a 500 billion baht ($14.3 billion) cash handout plan may be stalled.“Consumer and business confidence will be affected,” he said, “Spending and investment will slow down until the next government is formed.”The government has estimated growth of just 2.7% for 2024, lagging regional peers, while Thailand has been among Asia's worst-performing markets.The index slipped 1.29% after the court decision, before recovering to close 0.4% down.UNCERTAIN TRUCESrettha's Pheu Thai Party and its predecessors have borne the brunt of Thailand's turmoil, with two of its governments removed by coups in a long-running grudge match between the party's founders, the billionaire Shinawatra family, and their rivals in the conservative establishment and royalist military.“I am saddened to leave as a prime minister who was found to be unethical,” Srettha told reporters at Government House, adding it was possible the new government could change his policies.“I performed my duties with integrity and honesty.”Deputy premier Phumtham Wechayachai is expected to take over as caretaker prime minister.The ruling could rock a fragile truce between political heavyweight Thaksin Shinawatra and his enemies among the conservative elite and military old guard, which enabled the tycoon’s return from 15 years of self-exile in 2023 and ally Srettha to become premier the same day.Srettha had maintained his appointment of former Shinawatra lawyer Pichit Chuenban, who was briefly imprisoned for contempt of court in 2008 over an alleged attempt to bribe court staff, was above board. The bribery allegation was never proven and Pichit resigned in May.According to some political experts, it is likely Pheu Thai would still have the clout to lead the next administration, after a period of horse-trading and uncertainty over who will be in charge.“The coalition remains united,” said Olarn Thinbangtieo, deputy dean of Burapha University's Faculty of Political Science and Law.“There may be some impact on confidence, but that would be in the short term.”The next premier would need to have been nominated a prime ministerial candidate by their parties prior to the 2023 election, with Thaksin’s 37-year-old daughter and party leader Paetongtarn Shinawatra among Pheu Thai’s options.If successful, she would be Thailand’s third Shinawatra premier after Thaksin and her aunt, Yingluck Shinawatra.Other potential candidates include Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, Energy Minister Pirapan Salirathavibhaga and Prawit Wongsuwan, opens new tab, an influential former army chief who was involved in the last two coups.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. ","summary":"What animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.)

He first travelled to Karachi to transfer power to Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and Pakistan became an independent country on August 14, 1947. It is said that Quaid-i-Azam Jinnah was so jubilant that he hosted a lunch for Lord Mountbatten when many Muslims of the newly created Islamic country were observing Ramzan fast. The paradox of pre-1971 Pakistan was that its most populous flank in Bengal never got its due share in the power structure. The All-India Muslim League (AIML) was conceptualised in 1906 at the initiative of the Khwaja Salimullah Bahadur, the Nawab of Dhaka. The amalgamation of two distant territories with their different cultures within one union, based purely on shared religion, must have appeared incongruous even to the founders of Pakistan.The poet and philosopher Allama Muhammad Iqbal tried to encapsulate the idea of an independent Islamic country in South Asia in the early 1930s.

He succumbed to the pressure of religious fanatics and is mostly remembered for taking Pakistan firmly into the Western alliances of Cold War, such as the Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation, as its Prime Minister in 1956-57. It took almost a quarter of a century for his mentee in the Awami League, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, to win the independence of Bangladesh in 1971 at the cost of nearly 3 million lives lost in its struggle against the genocidal campaigns of the Pakistani Army.Intense antecedentsThe British first divided Bengal into several governance units and then created a united Bengali province in 1911 after further reorganisation. The economic and cultural elite of Bengal were predominantly Hindus. They chose the relatively cosmopolitan Calcutta to reside, and large parts outside of Dhaka in the eastern region remained rural and impoverished. The seeds of self-rule for Bengal had been sown in the minds of an emergent middle class in the early 20th century. The AIML succeeded in deflecting popular aspirations towards Muslim emancipation. Perhaps it’s fatalism that makes South Asians overlook their tragedies and the forgotten disaster of the Bengal Famine during World War II remains to be well documented. Conservative estimates of death due to hunger and deprivation stand between 3 to 5 million, most of it in the eastern part of the province. When told about the catastrophe brought about by colonial policies of denial and neglect, Churchill is reported to have blamed the victims for “breeding like rabbits”.

Perhaps what forced everyone’s hand to accept the inevitability of partition was the gruesome violence in the month of Ramzan in 1946. Responding to Jinnah’s call for the Direct Action Day on August 16, almost entire Bengal and parts of Bihar erupted into brutal confrontations between Hindus and Muslims. Estimates of casualties vary from 5,000 to 20,000 deaths and an unaccounted number of injured. After the Bihar Massacre of 1946, Bihari and Bengali Muslims, along with the Sikhs of Punjab, became some of the biggest losers of power games played out in New Delhi.Violent upheavalsThe colonial attitude of West Pakistan towards its eastern wing—the imposition of Urdu as its national language, the vicious suppression of the Bengali language movement in the 1950s and the neglect of devastation wrought by Cyclone Bhola in 1970—forced Bengalis of East Pakistan envisage an independent future despite its attendant uncertainties in the geopolitical reality of South Asia.

This historical process, a representation of the universally beneficial, inclusive and balanced \"re-globalization\", embodies the economic takeoff of developing countries and the diversification of the global power structure. Against such a background, the countries in the Global South are pushing, in a way that has never been seen before, to form a new economic order that better reflects fairness and win-win efforts.Data from the International Monetary Fund show that in 2023, the GDP of emerging economies and developing economies accounted for 58.9 percent of the global economy, a 7.6 percent increase after they first surpassed the developed economies in 2008. From 2000 to 2023, the emerging economies and developing economies averaged an economic growth rate of 5.2 percent, 3.3 percentage points higher than the average growth of developed economies. The rapid economic growth in the countries and regions of the Global South has contributed to the diversification of global economic growth and played a major part in boosting the world economy. The Global South, represented by BRICS, is making greater contributions to global economic growth than developed economies represented by the G7. According to statistics, China continued to contribute 30 percent of the world's economic growth in 2023, and will remain the largest contributor over the next five years.Regarding trade in goods, in 2022, the export and import of goods of developing economies accounted for 45.1 percent and 40.4 percent of the global total respectively, while the proportion of developed economies shrank drastically. In terms of investment, foreign direct investment to developing economies, with a 4.0 percent increase, accounted for 70.8 percent of the world's total FDI. At the same time, to improve the regional consistency in trade and investment policies, developing countries have signed many bilateral, multilateral and regional economic and trade agreements. This has steadily removed the trade and investment barriers among countries of the Global South, given rise to new international trade routes and new models of capital flow, and advanced the depth and breadth of global economic integration.The huge consumer market in the Global South, with the Chinese market as the locomotive, has been effectively activated, offering new pivots for the global industry and supply chains. The markets of the Global South countries will be connected to create a more open and inclusive business environment, provide high-quality supply to meet the world's new demands, and help optimize the global allocation of resources and production capacity.Countries in the Global South, sharing a common position, have deepened their cooperation in various forms to enhance their collective discourse power. These countries, upholding true multilateralism, have engaged more actively in reforming the multilateral system. They advocate independent political rights and interests, mutually beneficial cooperation for win-win results, fair and rational rules and regulations, an open and inclusive governance system, and green and sustainable development models. As such, they are sure to play a more important role in global economic development and governance.As leading representatives of emerging markets and developing economies, BRICS countries made up only 10.4 percent of the global economy in 1980, but the figure shot up to 31 percent in 2020, higher than the proportion of G7. At the 15th BRICS Summit in August 2023, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Argentina, Iran, and Ethiopia were invited to become new BRICS members. In January 2024, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, and Ethiopia became official members of BRICS, meaning the organization now has 10 members, whose economic aggregate accounts for 36 percent of the global total. The expansion of BRICS has magnified the voice of the Global South countries, reinforced their negotiating capability, given them more power to fight for the right to development in the international system, and enhanced their economic resilience as a whole. By working more closely together, the Global South countries have become the stabilizer of international economic order.The Global South countries are committed to the people-centered sustainable development enshrined in the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. They played an active part in the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27) in 2022 and the Group of 77 plus China Summit in 2023, vowing to strengthen unity and collaboration among themselves to jointly cope with the international challenges. In addition to economic benefits, the Global South countries, in their cooperation and development, place more stress on inclusive growth and integration of diversities, shedding new light on the path of global development.After World War II, the US-led Western countries spearheaded neoliberal globalization. This, however, has evidenced a series of drawbacks and increased the global economic governance deficit. In 2013, China put forward the Belt and Road Initiative and its vision of global governance featuring extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. Countries in the Global South will have a bigger say in global governance and consequently push the revision of international rules and standards in order to better represent developing countries' appeals and core interests. With their rising national strengths and international influence, those countries have already become a key force in propelling reforms in the global governance system, playing a positive role in climate response, energy governance and many other aspects.Statistics show that in 2023, China exported 4.91 million automobiles, of which 1.2 million were new energy vehicles, a year-on-year increase of 77.6 percent and marking the ninth consecutive year when Chinese NEV production and sales volume topped the world. NEVs have become a highlight of China's auto industry. China's success in this sector is solid proof that the Global South countries are able to be pioneers in high-tech domains. As the digital, green and inclusive trend of globalization prevails, they will join hands in refining their toolbox of economic policies to bridge the gap in the digital economy and the green and low-carbon economy.Some Western developed countries have been trying to output a single road of modernization to the world. Now the appearance of the Chinese path to modernization is showing the world that there is more than one way to do that. The Global South countries, based on their cultural traditions, systems and mechanisms, and reality of development, can pursue development paths suiting their own conditions, thus helping create a more diversified and just new order of global development and governance. It is with respect for diversity and inclusiveness that they have risen as a group. In the meantime, they have increased the understanding and support for each other through cultural exchanges and mutual learning, promoting the global exchange and integration of different cultures and laying the cultural foundation for building a more inclusive and equitable world. The Global South will be an indispensable driver of the \"re-globalization\" process and the mainstay in building a new international economic order.-China Daily/ ANN ","summary":"The rise of countries in the Global South is reshaping the international economic landscape and pushing the profound transformation of the global economic order.

As such, they are sure to play a more important role in global economic development and governance.As leading representatives of emerging markets and developing economies, BRICS countries made up only 10.4 percent of the global economy in 1980, but the figure shot up to 31 percent in 2020, higher than the proportion of G7. At the 15th BRICS Summit in August 2023, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Argentina, Iran, and Ethiopia were invited to become new BRICS members. In January 2024, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, and Ethiopia became official members of BRICS, meaning the organization now has 10 members, whose economic aggregate accounts for 36 percent of the global total. The expansion of BRICS has magnified the voice of the Global South countries, reinforced their negotiating capability, given them more power to fight for the right to development in the international system, and enhanced their economic resilience as a whole. By working more closely together, the Global South countries have become the stabilizer of international economic order.The Global South countries are committed to the people-centered sustainable development enshrined in the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. They played an active part in the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27) in 2022 and the Group of 77 plus China Summit in 2023, vowing to strengthen unity and collaboration among themselves to jointly cope with the international challenges. In addition to economic benefits, the Global South countries, in their cooperation and development, place more stress on inclusive growth and integration of diversities, shedding new light on the path of global development.After World War II, the US-led Western countries spearheaded neoliberal globalization. This, however, has evidenced a series of drawbacks and increased the global economic governance deficit. In 2013, China put forward the Belt and Road Initiative and its vision of global governance featuring extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. Countries in the Global South will have a bigger say in global governance and consequently push the revision of international rules and standards in order to better represent developing countries' appeals and core interests. With their rising national strengths and international influence, those countries have already become a key force in propelling reforms in the global governance system, playing a positive role in climate response, energy governance and many other aspects.Statistics show that in 2023, China exported 4.91 million automobiles, of which 1.2 million were new energy vehicles, a year-on-year increase of 77.6 percent and marking the ninth consecutive year when Chinese NEV production and sales volume topped the world. NEVs have become a highlight of China's auto industry. China's success in this sector is solid proof that the Global South countries are able to be pioneers in high-tech domains. As the digital, green and inclusive trend of globalization prevails, they will join hands in refining their toolbox of economic policies to bridge the gap in the digital economy and the green and low-carbon economy.Some Western developed countries have been trying to output a single road of modernization to the world. Now the appearance of the Chinese path to modernization is showing the world that there is more than one way to do that. The Global South countries, based on their cultural traditions, systems and mechanisms, and reality of development, can pursue development paths suiting their own conditions, thus helping create a more diversified and just new order of global development and governance. It is with respect for diversity and inclusiveness that they have risen as a group. In the meantime, they have increased the understanding and support for each other through cultural exchanges and mutual learning, promoting the global exchange and integration of different cultures and laying the cultural foundation for building a more inclusive and equitable world. The Global South will be an indispensable driver of the \"re-globalization\" process and the mainstay in building a new international economic order.-China Daily/ ANN "},{"hash":"adbb4d404d36ed4ca24702afc3cfa853aafe0af7b196e57460513fb64511529c","title":"Democracies in South Asia are facing challenges:\n\n- **Economic inequality:** Large wealth gaps and poverty undermine democratic institutions.\n- **Weak rule of law:** Corruption, impunity, and lack of accountability erode public trust.\n- **Political polarization:** Populist and nationalist movements exploit divisions, leading to political instability.\n- **External interference:** Foreign powers may meddle in elections or support authoritarian regimes.\n- **Threats to media freedom:** Journalists are silenced or attacked, limiting access to independent information.","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/08/12/south-asia-s-battered-democracies","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/LeadReuters-1723476568.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1723420800000,"source":"kp","category":"columns","content":"**Freedom and Democracy Decline Worldwide**\n\nRecent reports show a global decline in freedom and democracy.

Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them.

The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource. ","summary":"Scores of people have been killed in landslides, floods and other monsoon-induced disasters within a month of the monsoon entering Nepal in the second week of June. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service.

Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy.

The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy.
