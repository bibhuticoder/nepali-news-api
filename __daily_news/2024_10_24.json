We are preparing to operate cargo railway service also in the coming days,\" he added.\nThe Physical Infrastructure and Transport Minister arrived in Janakpurdham for inspecting the already constructed and the under-construction roads as well as the Nepal Railway. \nDescribing the Nepal Railway as a 'dream project', he asserted that efforts are on to expand the railway service up to Bardibas of Mahottari. The railway service currently is operated from Jayanagar-Janakpur to Bijalpura of Mahottari.\nAccording to him, the operation of railway service up to Bardibas is delayed due to the dispute over compensation of land acquired for the project.\nGeneral Manager of the Railway Company, Niranjan Jha, said they will recruit permanent employees soon to address the shortage of staff, expand the capacity of the station and construct the required infrastructures. He informed that the preparations for operating the railway service from Janakpurdham to Ayodhya of India have reached the final stage.   \nMeanwhile, Minister Dahal conducted an onsite inspection and monitoring of the Railway Service (Company) in Janakpurdham today to take stock of the Company's activities and progress. \nOn the occasion, he acquired necessary information from General Manager Jha and other officials and discussed on railway development and construction. \nHe boarded on a train compartment at the railway station in Janakpurdham and took a train ride up to Jayanagar of India in course of the inspection. \nNepal Railway Company has stated that it carried out transactions worth over Rs 77.5 million in the Fiscal Year 2023/24. More than 1.5 million passengers used the railway service last year.\nNine hundred thousand Nepali passengers and more than 600 thousand Indian passengers travelled using Nepal Railway Service which is currently operating from the Indian border town Jayanagar to Bhangaha of Mahottari via Janakpur, the capital of Madhes province.\nThe train service used to operate on 35 kilometres from Kurtha to Jayanagar of India since April 3, 2022 and it was extended on additional 17 kilometres up to Bhangaha of Mahottari on July 15, 2024. \nIt is said that the number of passengers is growing since the commencement of the railway service.  More than 3,000 passengers travel daily by Nepal Railway Service. \nThe Railway is operated with the financial and technical assistance of the Government of India. Indian technical employees are working for the railway service even till date. Twenty employees are working at present.\nNepal Railway has to pay Rs 7 million monthly to an Indian company in lieu of the employees' salary, cleaning of the compartments and repair and maintenance of the railway. \nAt present, the Indian side is carrying out the technical works for expanding the railway from Kurtha to Bardibas. Nepal Railway Company has expressed commitment to operate railway service on this 17 kilometres section within three years. The railway service will run on 69 kilometres once the construction works on this section are completed.\nThe Government of Nepal and the Government of India had signed an agreement, in 2010, to operate the railway service from Jayanagar to Bhangaha, Bardibas. As per the agreement, the Nepal government will provide the land while the Indian government will carry out all the works like construction of the track, station building, halt, bridges, drinking water, electricity supply, among other infrastructures.\nMeanwhile, addressing a press meet organized by the Press Chautari Mahottari at Lalgadh earlier today, Minister Dahal said the federal government has devised the necessary plans and was in the process of implementing them for building a 'prosperous Madhes province'. \nHe arrived here in connection with observing the projects implemented under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport in Mahottari and Dhanusha districts.\n"},{"hash":"fb7fd91d470dfd75cb906399e5e7a85be2ba346d1a0825d81bbb905d0813958c","title":"two-killed-due-to-lightning","date":1727222400000,"source":"nn","link":"https://nepalnews.com/s/issues/two-killed-due-to-lightning","imageLink":"https://web.nepalnews.com/storage/story/1024/lightning_1200x560_202006251416301693732952_1024.jpg","category":"issues","content":"\n    Two people have died when lightning struck them in Dodhara Chandani Municipality of Kanchanpur today.The deceased are 34-year-old Yam Bahadur Sunar of the Municipality-6 and 28-year-old Hiramati Rana of Laljhadi Rural Municipality-1 in the district, said Umesh Joshi, the Deputy Superintendent at the District Police Office. \nThirty-seven years old Jagadish Sunar of Dodhara Chandani Municipality was injured in the incident and is receiving medical treatment at the local Primary Health Centre.

The book named 'The Age of AI and Our Human Future' was co-authored by Henry A. Kissinger, Eric Schmidt and Daniel Huttenlocher.The book brings to light the trepidation associated with the defining topic of the hour, AI; the past technological endeavours and computer engineering to usher us in the present advancement, and the future prospects and potentials. The writers make clarion calls: Ensure human rights in AI development and deployment. \"Created by humans, AI should be overseen by humans,\" they underscore. They are for the prevailing human conscience over AI activities.\nThe book is divided into seven chapters: a) Where We Are, b) How We Got Here: Technology and Human Thought, c) From Turing to Today- and Beyond, d) Global Network Platforms, e) Security and World Order, f) AI and Human Identity, and g) AI and Future. Every chapter succinctly provides related information and evolution that relates to AI.\nThe first chapter 'Where We Are' has a vivid description of the current stage. It finely summarizes the achievements of AI we are enjoying, and concurrent fear and obsession of panacea and doom. \"While the number of individuals capable of creating AI is growing, the ranks of those contemplating this technology's implications for humanity- social, legal, philosophical, spiritual, moral- remain dangerously thin,\" the trio warned. As we gradually outsource AI for almost every aspect we behave with, the utter absence of 'self-awareness' in AI is the point where the human role is urgent. The references to AlphaZero's victory, a spurt of GPT-3, and the discovery of 'halicin' by AI are some significant subjects explained in this chapter. \nThe discovery of 'halicin' was a milestone in medicine made possible by deep learning. \"The AI that discovered halicin has expanded human researchers' concepts both narrow (bacteria eradication, drug delivery) and broad (disease, medicine, health)\", they observed. The discovery will certainly revolutionize these sectors, thereby hugely benefiting human life. AlphaZero had a pivotal role in expanding the human conception of chess, while GPT-3 bewildered humans with previously unfeasible tasks easily doable- translation, editing, content writing, text and pictures, films. \nSimilarly, the second chapter 'How We Got Here' reminds the readers that technological progress and prowess have an adequate background of the society that fosters discourse and debates on emerging issues. \"During the revolutionary era, innovative technology, novel paradigms, and widespread political and social adaptations reinforced one another,\" they argued. It suggests that technological development does not advance piecemeal, but is bolstered by other factors in society. Indeed, the societies that failed or slowed to whet adequate discussions on the social and political fronts did not witness IT progress as compared to the societies that favoured an atmosphere open and free for exchanges of innovative ideas. The Western world's revolutions in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries formed concepts on roles of the human mind and conscience that helped cope with reality, according to them.\nChapter four: 'Global Network Platforms' is another compelling study on the digital networks that have spanned across the world- people stuck to these for many activities. Initially launched to connect the people and foster a borderless society, the network platforms have emerged so mighty that their presence began threatening national and international governance. The adoption of AI by these networks with gradual sophistication is behind the trepidation. With the vast gathering of users' data and customization, the users are lured to glue to these platforms, and victimized by the manipulation and disinformation in many cases. \"As AI becomes increasingly critical to network platforms functioning, it is also becoming, gradually and unobtrusively, a sorter and shaper of reality- and, in effect, an actor on the national and global stage.\" As the writers have suggested and cautioned in this chapter, the subsequent activities of the Meta and X prove their observation. \nThey also bring the references of TikTok ban in different countries, reasoning the breach of users' data and privacy. With references to the perception of the US, China, Europe, India, Russia, and South East Asia towards network platforms, the writers made analyses of the platforms from the geopolitical perspective as well. \n\"In Beijing, Washington, and some European capitals, concern has been expressed (and articulated obliquely elsewhere) about the implications of conducting broad aspects of the national economic and social life of network platforms facilitated by AI designed in other, potentially rival, countries,\" they stated. \nThe chapter: 'Security and World Order' also captivates the readers by showing the security dimension is changing with AI adoption which ultimately affects the world order. In the absence of security, human society cannot function smoothly and in a peaceful manner. The society remains an organized whole once the security is in place. But when security is defined and determined by evolving issues like AI, the society warrants new approaches to cope with and survive in an order. \"The AI era risks complicating the riddles of modern strategy beyond human intention- or perhaps complete human comprehension,\" they mentioned, showing an urgency of taming the use of AI for humankind.\nMoreover, they project and recommend that within some decades, it is essential to secure a balance of power, taking into account the intangibles of cyber conflicts, massive disinformation and characteristic qualities of AI-fueled war.   \nIn the chapter 'From Turing to Today- and Beyond', there is a description of the Turing test which is a remarkable topic and moment in the thought experiment. It was however interpreted in both extremes of good and bad. British mathematician Alan Turing's inquiry: 'Can machines think?' emerged in the mid-twentieth century spurred intense debates and research on the human mind and behaviour, and saw additions to arrive at the present age of AI. Turing's article 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence' created a revolution in the interpretation of human thoughts (intelligence) and its potential. The writers meticulously shed light on the chronological development of intelligence since then to the present and beyond. However, the AI could not evolve in a gradual pace. It was an 'AI winter' from the late 1980s to the 1990s. \"For decades, a lack of computing power and sophisticated algorithms slowed the development of all but rudimentary neural networks. Advances in both fields, however, have now liberated AI developers from these restrictions\" (pg 63). \nThe allusion to Rene Descartes and his foundational philosophy of reality and reason make the book further gripping. 'I think therefore I'm' is a quintessential view of Descartes that dominated the Renaissance in the West and paved a way for further development of science and technology. Writers Kissinger, Schmidt and Huttenlocher wonder if reality and reason are hijacked by AI, what would be the future of humanity? What's the meaning of our existence? They cautioned over growing anthropomorphism.\nAI has no creativity \nIrrespective of the sheer disruption and transformation caused by AI, it has no creativity, no common sense, no sentiment, no self-awareness and no reflection of its discovery. It is human for creativity, emotion and conscience. The writers' observation: \"It (AI) does not know what it doesn't know\" speaks volumes and endorses human superiority. \nUnderlining the urgency of a guiding philosophy of AI, the writers make an emphatic recommendation: \"The AI age needs its own Descartes, its own Kant, to explain what is being created and what it will mean for humanity.\" It is stated in the chapter 'AI and the Human Future'.\nThe book written by three colossus persons- Kissinger, now the late Nobel laureate, and defining person of international relations and strategy; Schmidt, once a Silicon Valley egghead; and Huttenlocher, MIT Professor on Computing, undoubtedly prompt the entire world to ruminate on AI. Since the publication of the book in 2021, the AI revolution has been further augmented, forcing the national, regional and international bodies, including the UN, to prepare future policies and strategies to navigate this realm. \nThe text is an essential read for the present generation. It was first published by John Murray, a Hachette UK company. It cost 20 Pounds. \n","summary":"\n    Three formidable figures came together to write a book on an epoch-making concern- artificial intelligence (AI).

I would also like to reaffirm Nepal’s full support as you undertake the important responsibilities entrusted to you.\nWe extend our deepest appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis, the outgoing President, for his commendable leadership in successfully guiding the 78th Session of the Assembly.\nOur highest accolades are due to the Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres, for his tireless dedication to reinforcing multilateralism in tackling global challenges. \nI fondly recall your visit to Nepal last year, Mr. Secretary-General, and your message of peace from the sacred birthplace of Gautam Buddha, and the message of climate catastrophe of mountains from the Everest region. \nMr. President,\nThe world is at a watershed moment in history. \nThe contrast between rich and poor, harmony and hatred, and economic development and environmental destruction have never been as stark as they are today.\nBoth people and planet stand on the brink of climate catastrophe.\nGeopolitical rivalries are resurging. \nMilitary expenditures are skyrocketing along with an unabetted arms race. \nThe spectre of nuclear conflict looms larger than ever before.\nOn one hand, our economy remains frail, still grappling with the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, on the other, nationalism and protectionism have re-emerged, even before we have reaped the benefits that liberalisation and globalisation were meant to deliver. \nEven after three hundred years of industrialization and modernization journey, it is deeply troubling that in our so-called civilized world of 21st century, wealth and prosperity are concentrated mostly at the hand of Global North and the poverty and destitution are heavily concentrated in the Global South, particularly in the least developed countries (LDCs). \nTo overcome these travesties, we must demonstrate our leadership that promotes meaningful cooperation and collaboration. \nIt is only through collective will and unified action that we can turn the tide and usher in an era of enduring peace and shared prosperity for all.\nIn this context, the theme of this Session “Leaving No One Behind: Acting Together for the Advancement of Peace, Sustainable Development and Human Dignity for Present and Future Generations,” could not be more timely or relevant.\nWe have reaffirmed our commitment through the ‘Summit of the Future’ to build a safe, just, and sustainable world for both present and future generations.  \nThis pledge is embodied in the three pivotal documents we have adopted: Pact of the Future, Declaration on Future Generation, and the Global Digital Compact. \nWe must demonstrate our determination to implement these documents for the wellbeing of present and future generations.  \nMr. President,\nAllow me to underline that the principle of ‘Leaving No One Behind’ has long been the cornerstone of Nepal’s approach to development across all sectors.\nThis philosophy is enshrined in our Constitution which upholds the values of democracy by guaranteeing inclusivity, equality, justice, proportional representation, human rights, and social protection for the most vulnerable sections of society.\nI am determined to lead my country with my deep conviction to ‘comprehensive democracy’. \nFor me, comprehensive democracy ensures equal rights, equal access to opportunities, social justice, protects the vulnerable communities, and provides the security and dignity for all individuals. \nDemocracy goes far beyond the right of the people to choose their leaders. It is about leading the people towards prosperity and happiness so that they could feel highest level of dignity. \nAt the international level, sovereign equality and mutual respect constitute the bedrock of comprehensive democracy. \nThese principles are essential for building the frameworks of a just, inclusive, equitable, representative, and accountable global order. \nMr. President,\nAs a nation emerging from conflict, Nepal deeply understands the profound value of peace and political stability. \nSince the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006, Nepal has been firmly focused on completing the peace process at the earliest. \nImmediately after the formation of my government, parliament passed a Transitional Justice bill to settle transitional justice issue once and for all. \nWhile we implement the law, we will uphold victims’ rights, including truth and justice. \nWe will also use reparations and reconciliation to heal the wounds and scars of conflict period. We appreciate support from international community including the UN system in this regard. \nThe present government, formed by the collaboration of our two major political parties, is determined to secure stability while driving economic transformation for the inclusive and equitable prosperity to our people. \nAt this juncture, stability and economic transformation are paramount to us than our periodic competition in elections. \nWe have dedicated ourselves to realizing our national aspiration: ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali.’\nNepal will be graduating from its LDC status by 2026. We are diligently working towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 and aspire to become a developed country by 2043, despite facing significant economic headwinds. \nHowever, our path to achieving the SDGs remains fraught with difficulties. We are confronted with a substantial financial gap of about 24 billion US dollars to attain the 2030 Agenda. \nIn this backdrop, Nepal hosted the IDA 21 replenishment meeting last June, underscoring the crucial need for continued and enhanced support from the International Development Association along with other development partners. \nIn this pursuit, we strongly reiterate our call for enhanced, predictable, and sustained international support. \nMr. President,\nClimate change has emerged as the gravest threat to our planet, people, and prosperity. \nMy own country, Nepal, is particularly hard hit. We stand as one of the most vulnerable nations to climate change and are ranked as the 20th most disaster-prone country in the world.\nOf utmost concern is the alarming rate at which the pristine Himalayas, often referred to as the Third Pole, are losing their vast snow reserves. \nThis loss threatens water availability for billions of people living downstream, extending far beyond the borders of my country.\nNepal has hugely been contributing to the health of our planet through its forests, mountains and rivers. \nYet, despite these efforts, we continue to bear the brunt of climate change. In this context, we call for climate justice. \nOur mountains play a crucial role in regulating the climate and ecosystem of oceans, with their snow-fed rivers flowing down to the oceans. \nNepal’s Himalayas, as a natural climate stabiliser, help maintain a cooling system in a region situated in the hottest zone of the planet between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.\nGiven their significance, it is essential that the mountain agenda should receive due attention in climate negotiations. \nNepal is steadfast in its commitment to the Paris Agreement and aims to achieve net zero target by 2045, five year earlier than global target. \nAs climate change is a global challenge, it demands global action and collaborative efforts to address its widespread and cascading impacts.\nAdequate climate financing including ‘Loss and Damage’ fund is crucial to support climate-resilient measures and infrastructure for adaptation in developing countries not least in LDCs. \nMr. President,\nNepal’s land is blessed with the wisdom of enlightened great sages from both the Hindu and Buddhist faith, particularly the teachings of Gautam Buddha. \nThis profound legacy has shaped our world view to seek global harmony, peace, and security.\nThe values of love, harmony, tolerance, and empathy as espoused by Gautam Buddha, hold even greater relevance today than they did over two thousand five hundred years ago.\nBut, to our deep dismay, the world is increasingly distressed by division, suspicion, hatred, and enmity. \nNepal firmly believes that dialogue and diplomacy are the sole means to resolve conflicts, including in Ukraine and the Middle East. It is through love and compassion that hostility and hatred can be overcome, paving the way for lasting peace.\nOn the issue of Israel-Palestine conflict, we continue to support a two-state solution, where Israel and Palestine coexist peacefully and securely within internationally recognised borders, in line with relevant United Nations resolutions.\nWe must address the worsening humanitarian crises in regions such as Libya, Syria, Sudan, South Sudan, Yemen, and elsewhere.\nIt is vital to uphold the principles of sovereign equality, non-interference as enshrined in the UN Charter to ensure peace and stability. Consequently, we staunchly oppose any form of unilateral intervention or sanctions.\nMr. President,\nDisarmament and non-proliferation issues must be prioritised. \nNepal strongly advocates for the general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction. As the host country to the UN Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, Nepal firmly believes that regional efforts, including the Kathmandu Process, serve to strengthen the global disarmament regime. \nTechnology presents a double-edged sword, especially for the Least Developed Countries. \nIf we harness it, we can make remarkable progress.

I would also like to reaffirm Nepal’s full support as you undertake the important responsibilities entrusted to you.\nWe extend our deepest appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis, the outgoing President, for his commendable leadership in successfully guiding the 78th Session of the Assembly.\nOur highest accolades are due to the Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres, for his tireless dedication to reinforcing multilateralism in tackling global challenges. \nI fondly recall your visit to Nepal last year, Mr. Secretary-General, and your message of peace from the sacred birthplace of Gautam Buddha, and the message of climate catastrophe of mountains from the Everest region. \nMr. President,\nThe world is at a watershed moment in history. \nThe contrast between rich and poor, harmony and hatred, and economic development and environmental destruction have never been as stark as they are today.\nBoth people and planet stand on the brink of climate catastrophe.\nGeopolitical rivalries are resurging. \nMilitary expenditures are skyrocketing along with an unabetted arms race. \nThe spectre of nuclear conflict looms larger than ever before.\nOn one hand, our economy remains frail, still grappling with the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, on the other, nationalism and protectionism have re-emerged, even before we have reaped the benefits that liberalisation and globalisation were meant to deliver. \nEven after three hundred years of industrialization and modernization journey, it is deeply troubling that in our so-called civilized world of 21st century, wealth and prosperity are concentrated mostly at the hand of Global North and the poverty and destitution are heavily concentrated in the Global South, particularly in the least developed countries (LDCs). \nTo overcome these travesties, we must demonstrate our leadership that promotes meaningful cooperation and collaboration. \nIt is only through collective will and unified action that we can turn the tide and usher in an era of enduring peace and shared prosperity for all.\nIn this context, the theme of this Session “Leaving No One Behind: Acting Together for the Advancement of Peace, Sustainable Development and Human Dignity for Present and Future Generations,” could not be more timely or relevant.\nWe have reaffirmed our commitment through the ‘Summit of the Future’ to build a safe, just, and sustainable world for both present and future generations.  \nThis pledge is embodied in the three pivotal documents we have adopted: Pact of the Future, Declaration on Future Generation, and the Global Digital Compact. \nWe must demonstrate our determination to implement these documents for the wellbeing of present and future generations.  \nMr. President,\nAllow me to underline that the principle of ‘Leaving No One Behind’ has long been the cornerstone of Nepal’s approach to development across all sectors.\nThis philosophy is enshrined in our Constitution which upholds the values of democracy by guaranteeing inclusivity, equality, justice, proportional representation, human rights, and social protection for the most vulnerable sections of society.\nI am determined to lead my country with my deep conviction to ‘comprehensive democracy’. \nFor me, comprehensive democracy ensures equal rights, equal access to opportunities, social justice, protects the vulnerable communities, and provides the security and dignity for all individuals. \nDemocracy goes far beyond the right of the people to choose their leaders. It is about leading the people towards prosperity and happiness so that they could feel highest level of dignity. \nAt the international level, sovereign equality and mutual respect constitute the bedrock of comprehensive democracy. \nThese principles are essential for building the frameworks of a just, inclusive, equitable, representative, and accountable global order. \nMr. President,\nAs a nation emerging from conflict, Nepal deeply understands the profound value of peace and political stability. \nSince the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006, Nepal has been firmly focused on completing the peace process at the earliest. \nImmediately after the formation of my government, parliament passed a Transitional Justice bill to settle transitional justice issue once and for all. \nWhile we implement the law, we will uphold victims’ rights, including truth and justice. \nWe will also use reparations and reconciliation to heal the wounds and scars of conflict period. We appreciate support from international community including the UN system in this regard. \nThe present government, formed by the collaboration of our two major political parties, is determined to secure stability while driving economic transformation for the inclusive and equitable prosperity to our people. \nAt this juncture, stability and economic transformation are paramount to us than our periodic competition in elections. \nWe have dedicated ourselves to realizing our national aspiration: ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali.’\nNepal will be graduating from its LDC status by 2026. We are diligently working towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 and aspire to become a developed country by 2043, despite facing significant economic headwinds. \nHowever, our path to achieving the SDGs remains fraught with difficulties. We are confronted with a substantial financial gap of about 24 billion US dollars to attain the 2030 Agenda. \nIn this backdrop, Nepal hosted the IDA 21 replenishment meeting last June, underscoring the crucial need for continued and enhanced support from the International Development Association along with other development partners. \nIn this pursuit, we strongly reiterate our call for enhanced, predictable, and sustained international support. \nMr. President,\nClimate change has emerged as the gravest threat to our planet, people, and prosperity. \nMy own country, Nepal, is particularly hard hit. We stand as one of the most vulnerable nations to climate change and are ranked as the 20th most disaster-prone country in the world.\nOf utmost concern is the alarming rate at which the pristine Himalayas, often referred to as the Third Pole, are losing their vast snow reserves. \nThis loss threatens water availability for billions of people living downstream, extending far beyond the borders of my country.\nNepal has hugely been contributing to the health of our planet through its forests, mountains and rivers. \nYet, despite these efforts, we continue to bear the brunt of climate change. In this context, we call for climate justice. \nOur mountains play a crucial role in regulating the climate and ecosystem of oceans, with their snow-fed rivers flowing down to the oceans. \nNepal’s Himalayas, as a natural climate stabiliser, help maintain a cooling system in a region situated in the hottest zone of the planet between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.\nGiven their significance, it is essential that the mountain agenda should receive due attention in climate negotiations. \nNepal is steadfast in its commitment to the Paris Agreement and aims to achieve net zero target by 2045, five year earlier than global target. \nAs climate change is a global challenge, it demands global action and collaborative efforts to address its widespread and cascading impacts.\nAdequate climate financing including ‘Loss and Damage’ fund is crucial to support climate-resilient measures and infrastructure for adaptation in developing countries not least in LDCs. \nMr. President,\nNepal’s land is blessed with the wisdom of enlightened great sages from both the Hindu and Buddhist faith, particularly the teachings of Gautam Buddha. \nThis profound legacy has shaped our world view to seek global harmony, peace, and security.\nThe values of love, harmony, tolerance, and empathy as espoused by Gautam Buddha, hold even greater relevance today than they did over two thousand five hundred years ago.\nBut, to our deep dismay, the world is increasingly distressed by division, suspicion, hatred, and enmity. \nNepal firmly believes that dialogue and diplomacy are the sole means to resolve conflicts, including in Ukraine and the Middle East. It is through love and compassion that hostility and hatred can be overcome, paving the way for lasting peace.\nOn the issue of Israel-Palestine conflict, we continue to support a two-state solution, where Israel and Palestine coexist peacefully and securely within internationally recognised borders, in line with relevant United Nations resolutions.\nWe must address the worsening humanitarian crises in regions such as Libya, Syria, Sudan, South Sudan, Yemen, and elsewhere.\nIt is vital to uphold the principles of sovereign equality, non-interference as enshrined in the UN Charter to ensure peace and stability. Consequently, we staunchly oppose any form of unilateral intervention or sanctions.\nMr. President,\nDisarmament and non-proliferation issues must be prioritised. \nNepal strongly advocates for the general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction. As the host country to the UN Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, Nepal firmly believes that regional efforts, including the Kathmandu Process, serve to strengthen the global disarmament regime. \nTechnology presents a double-edged sword, especially for the Least Developed Countries. \nIf we harness it, we can make remarkable progress. If we fail, it will leave us further behind. We call for technology transfer to enable us to catch up. \nMr. President,\nNepal has always adhered to a peaceful, independent, balanced, and non-aligned foreign policy, based on the principles of Panchsheel, the UN Charter, international law, and norms of world peace.\nWe conduct our foreign policy with profound belief in ‘Amity with All, Enmity with None.’\nNepal remains committed to further strengthening its close, cordial, and constructive relations with its immediate neighbours and beyond, rooted in the principles of mutual respect, sovereign equality, territorial integrity, non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, and peaceful co-existence.\nAs the largest contributor of troops and police to UN Peace operations, Nepal stands ready to further enhance its contribution to global peace and security.\nNepal believes it is our rightful call for having commensurate representation in the leadership positions, both at the UN headquarters and in the field, reflecting our significant contribution.\nMr. President,\nNepal firmly advocates for the reform of the UN System to make it more effective, democratic, transparent, and accountable.\nWe firmly believe that stronger multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core, is the only path forward to tackle the numerous global crises we face.\nWe echo a call for substantial reform of the global financial system, as aptly described it by Secretary-General Mr. António Guterres as “morally bankrupt.”  \nThe voice and representation of countries in special situations including the LDCs, Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs), and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) must be ensured. \nMr. President,\nNepal firmly upholds the belief that all human rights are universal, inalienable, indivisible, interdependent, and interrelated. \nIt is with this conviction that we have become a party to twenty-four international human rights-related conventions and protocols, including seven of the nine core instruments.\nWe are fully committed to promoting gender equality and ensuring equal rights for women.

He also asserted that the economy is showing signs of improvement and that the government is not going to compromise on issues like national interest, good governance and development. “The economy was in chaos when we joined the government. Today there are signs of improvement. Confidence in the private sector has increased, and as per their demand, the government has formed the Economic Reform Commission,” he said.Earlier this month, the government announced a five-member high-level commission led by former finance secretary Rameshore Khanal to recommend reforms to revitalise the economy.Meanwhile, leaders from opposition parties have drawn the attention of President Ramchandra Paudel towards the ‘wrongdoings’ of the government.A group of leaders including CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who is also the leader of the main opposition in the House of Representatives, on Wednesday met the President. Their meeting came two days after they submitted a 13-point memorandum to Prime Minister Oli warning him against, among other things, revising the Political Party Act, allegedly to facilitate party splits, through an ordinance.The leaders urged the President to play a role of guardian and the custodian of the constitution while stating that the government was scheming against the constitution and pluralism, said Kiran Pokharal, press adviser to the President.The President assured them that he was committed to fulfilling his constitutional duties and would work for national unity, Pokharel said. However, an opposition leader who participated in the meeting told the Post that the President explained to them about the limitations of a constitutional head of state. “You know well about the limitations of my office. If the government forwards any such ordinance, I will consult you all on the matter,” the leader quoted the President as saying.Leaders from the Rastriya Swatantra Party, Rastriya Prajatantra Party, CPN (Unified Socialist) and Aam Janata Party accompanied Dahal during the visit.The opposition parties have accused Prime Minister Oli of preparing to ease the split of other political parties by amending the Political Party Act-2017 through an ordinance. Oli, however, has denied the claims.Opposition leaders, meanwhile, took aim at the government, accusing it of spending its first 100 days protecting corrupt individuals.“The government has completed 100 days, and it has proven exactly what we feared when it was formed,” said Maoist Centre Chairman Dahal while receiving a memorandum from the Nepal Intellectual Organisation, which is affiliated to the Maoist Centre, on Wednesday.“Ruling party members, civil society groups and even some people within the government have voiced dissatisfaction with the government’s performance,” Dahal said.Other opposition party leaders have also expressed similar frustrations at ‘the poor performance of the government’.In his address to the nation on Wednesday, the prime minister said that the government was committed to reining in corruption from any time.“The government has begun action against cooperatives fraud. Over 600 people have already been prosecuted and as many as 575 are in jail,” he said.But Oli avoided mentioning the arrest of Rabi Lamichhane, the president of the Rastriya Swatantra Party who is currently in police custody on charges of misusing funds from credit cooperatives in Kaski, Rupandehi, and Chitwan districts.“Besides taking legal action, we are also trying to set up a cooperative authority in order to ensure that depositors get their money back, as well as a cooperative credit information centre, and credit tribunal to provide justice to the victims of cooperatives fraud,” said the prime minister.He went on to claim that 70 percent of the government’s planned tasks have already been completed within the first 100 days. He took office on July 15. Just three weeks ago, over 391 people were killed in floods and landslides across the country. Two days of continuous rainfall across the country caused extensive damage to both private and public property, including roads, highways, and several infrastructure projects.The 391 bereaved families have received Rs200,000 each in compensation, and an additional Rs40.5 million has been distributed to another 2,555 families affected by the disaster, the prime minister said. The government has allocated Rs430 million to flood-affected 71 local units around the country, he said.He also claimed that the government was working “on a war footing” to rebuild the damaged infrastructure, including bridges and highways, and disbursed millions of rupees in various districts to carry out the reconstruction work, repairing the bridges and highways, among others. The prime minister also stated that the government has left no stone unturned to compensate the victims of last November’s earthquake in Jajarkot, West Rukum, Bajhang, Bajura and Doti districts.Speaking about other sectors, the prime minister said that over three million farmers in 35 districts had not received payments for their milk supplies, but his government has provided half of the farmers their outstanding payments in the 100 days. He also said the government has released the dues to 75,000 sugarcane farmers.Highlighting the achievements of his government, the prime minister claimed that his government has secured chemical fertilisers for the upcoming winter, released Rs800 million for agriculture insurance, and paid Rs6.75 billion dues to contractors. It also provided startup funds to 165 youths for innovative ventures. Likewise, the government has received Rs34 billion in commitment for setting up various industrial units, the share market has rebounded, and Nepal’s sovereign credit ratings evaluation is in its final stage, the prime minister added. Earlier in the morning, the ruling parties held a meeting to evaluate the performance of the government and discuss contemporary issues. At the meeting, the ruling coalition emphasised the need for an impartial investigation into the cooperatives scam.The prime minister’s secretariat said the coalition parties have agreed to issue separate statements calling for fair judicial proceedings and adherence to democratic norms. RSP chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane was arrested by a Central Investigation Bureau team from his party office in Kathmandu on Friday and subsequently taken to Pokhara for trial for cooperatives fraud and organised crime.A complaint has been registered at the Kaski District Police Office accusing Lamichhane of misusing millions of rupees from a Pokhara-based cooperative. RSP leaders, activists, and supporters have staged demonstrations in Pokhara and other places for the past few days, demanding the release of its chairman, Lamichhane. Lamichhane and several others are accused of misappropriating funds from the Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Savings and Credit Cooperative. His arrest followed a parliamentary probe that linked him and others to the embezzlement of millions of rupees from the cooperative. The probe panel submitted its report a month ago and the government had immediately decided to implement its findings.  ","summary":"Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has warned his opponents against ‘daydreaming’ of toppling the government.Presenting the achievements of the government’s 100 days in office, the prime minister on Wednesday said that any attempts to break up the coalition of the two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—from power would be futile.Opposition parties, however, claim that the Oli government has been a total failure and is only focussed on protecting the corrupt.“Some are spreading rumours that the government could collapse anytime—today or tonight or by next morning,” said Oli. “These rumours are aimed at undermining the government’s functioning.”The prime minister also claimed that the government has good rapport with the bureaucracy.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) announced that the Montreal Convention liability limits for death, injury, delays, baggage, and cargo issues will increase on December 28, 2024. Nepal implemented the Montreal Convention for the first time on December 15, 2018. Millions of air passengers worldwide are entitled to compensation for yearly flight delays, cancellations, and overbooking. Because passengers are unaware of their rights and airlines make it so hard to get their money, less than 2 percent receive their flight compensation, according to a study. Here is what you need to know about the Montreal Convention and your air passenger rights. Claim what you owe.What is the Montreal Convention 1999 or MC99?The Montreal Convention is a multilateral treaty adopted by a diplomatic meeting of International Civil Aviation Organisation member states in 1999. Ratified in 1999 and enacted in 2003, the Montreal Convention was a successor to the Warsaw Convention 1929.Formally known as the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, the Montreal Convention 1999 (or MC99) has established a comprehensive and unified framework for the international carriage of passengers, baggage, and cargo by air. It introduced several elements to balance the interests of travellers, cargo shippers, and the aviation industry. The Convention sets liability limits for airlines, ensuring fair compensation for consumers in cases of injury, death, delay, baggage and cargo issues. ICAO has informed the 140 State Parties that the limits will increase in line with the Convention’s built-in review mechanism, which adjusts for inflation every five years. This ensures that passenger and cargo compensation remains appropriate over time. This is the fourth review since the treaty came into force in 2003. \"ICAO continues to advocate for the universal ratification of MC99,\" said Juan Carlos Salazar, the ICAO secretary general, in a statement. \"This Convention is fundamental in protecting consumer interests in international air travel. By promoting harmonisation and codification of rules governing international carriage by air, MC99 benefits passengers and cargo shippers while enabling the unified and equitable development of air services.\"What are the liability provisions?The liability limits are indicated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), a unit of account defined by the International Monetary Fund. For indicative purposes, 1 SDR has been valued at US$ 1.33318 on October 18, 2024. What are the revisions? The limits will be revised as follows: 1. The death or bodily injury limit will increase from 128,821 SDRs to 151,880 SDRs (about US$202,500). It originally was 100,000 SDRs in 2003. 2. The limit for passenger transport delays will rise from 5,346 SDRs to 6,303 SDRs (about US$8,400). 3. The limit for baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay will increase from 1,288 SDRs to 1,519 SDRs (about US$2,000). 4. The limit for cargo destruction, loss, damage, or delay will rise from 22 SDRs to 26 SDRs per kilogram (about US$35). ICAO has invited the States Parties to MC99 to make provisions as necessary in accordance with their domestic legal requirements, to give full effect to the revised limits as of December 28, 2024.What’s the case of Nepal?The Montreal Convention allows air passengers on international flights to claim compensation for damages caused by travel disruptions and luggage problems. Since travellers in Nepal are not aware that they can file a compensation claim, many passengers protest at the airport against the delays, cancellations, baggage damages and other issues caused by the airlines' negligence. For example, if the passengers' baggage is damaged, under the rule, passengers can claim up to $2,000 with the particular airline.However, the Montreal Convention waives the airline’s liability in cases where extraordinary circumstances caused the flight disruption. Such cases include adverse weather, Air Traffic congestion and restrictions, lightning strikes, bird strikes, strikes at the airport, medical emergencies, security threats, and political unrest, etc. You can also claim when … ?On November 30 last year, Flight RA229 of the state-owned Nepal Airlines flew two hours before its scheduled departure, leaving 31 passengers stranded at midnight at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport. The reason for the rushed departure was the flight’s VVIP status. Then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal was on the same flight. The flight was planned for Dahal, who left for Dubai leading the Nepali delegation to the 28th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 28). According to experts, the case is severe negligence by the airline company, and passengers can still file compensation cases as per the Convention.The MC99 extends a time frame within which a passenger can claim compensation for damages – up to two years following the occurrence of the flight disruption. If the claim pertains to damaged, lost, or delayed luggage, it's imperative to report the issue expeditiously. Claims for damaged baggage should be filed within seven days, while claims for delayed baggage must be initiated within 21 days. If your bags remain unclaimed for more than 21 days and are considered lost, you still can file a claim within two years.Where to file the claims?According to Vijay Shrestha, vice-president of administration at Himalaya Airlines, passengers can file a compensation claim by filling out a “property irregularity form” at the airline office or the airline’s ground handling agent in any destination airport.Luggage will be categorised as lost if the airline cannot trace it for 21 days from filing the property irregularity report. All claims shall be substantiated with an itemised list of contents, description, age, and proof of purchase or ownership of all items. At Kathmandu airport, passengers can file compensation claims for loss, delay, or damage at the lost and found unit of Nepal Airlines. “The compensation provision used to be printed on tickets, but since airlines issue e-tickets nowadays, passengers can go to the ‘contract of carriage by air’ on the airline's website to know the information regarding the loss, delay, or damage,” said Shrestha. Is MC99 applicable to domestic airlines? The MC99 makes only international airlines liable in case of passenger death or injury.A year after Nepal adopted the MC99, preparations for adopting a similar law started but could not proceed, although the draft had been prepared.Tourism ministry officials say the process was stalled multiple times as governments changed. Since 2019, there have been six fatal plane and helicopter crashes that killed 130 people, and all the families of the victims have been barred from a justifiable compensation that would be $100,000 as per the proposed provisions.The air carriers’ liability and insurance draft bill for domestic airlines has been sent to the finance ministries for their comments before being tabled by the Cabinet. After the Cabinet nod, the bill will be tabled in Parliament.What’s the provision in the proposed domestic law? As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost and damaged shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the airlines, it says. The cargo damage is limited up to $5,000.The compensation for the hand baggage, if lost or damaged, shall be $400.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons.

Registrar duo Bimal Poudel and Bhadrakali Pokharel are its members.“The full court agreed to constitute the panel to implement the report,” a justice told the Post.Amid complaints of corruption, then-chief justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana in August, 2020 constituted the eight-member committee to study the allegations and recommend solutions. Chief Justice Prakash Man Singh Raut, then a justice, too was a member of the committee. Ever since assuming office as the chief of judiciary on October 7, Raut has pledged to implement the Karki panel’s report.He called the full court a week after the Supreme Court returned to work following a two-week Dashain holiday. All the justices of the top court are present in the full court meeting chaired by the chief justice. The 21-strong court has 15 justices at present. The full court can make policy decisions relating to the apex court or the entire judiciary.If the claim of Supreme Court officials is anything to go by, all the justices unanimously agreed to take the report in implementation.“The chief justice is committed to implementing most of the recommendations in the report. The full court has paved the way for it,” Govinda Prasad Ghimire, information officer at the court, told the Post. “It has already been implemented partly. Now it needs to be implemented further.” In December 2021, the top court started adopting a lottery system to assign cases to justices. As per the long-standing tradition, the chief justice had been assigning benches to the justices. Currently, the cause list is finalised in an automated system. The new measure was as prescribed by the Karki-led panel.The report has proposed several measures to curb the malpractices right from the selection of the justices. Several of the recommendations need revision in the laws and even in the constitution for their implementation.The report has outlined the sectors in need of reform, specifying eight areas including the Supreme Court, Judicial Council, Judicial Service Commission, Office of the Attorney General, law enforcement agencies (such as the police and the anti-corruption commission), the Nepal Bar Association, the Nepal Law Practitioners' Council, and the Government of Nepal, among others. The report proposed both policy and legal reforms for these sectors.It has suggested review of the jurisdiction of all tiers of courts, including specialised courts and tribunals, to minimise the workload of the top court. Currently, it has 25,000 cases to settle. The report proposed amending the law to grant district courts the authority to hear original cases in almost all circumstances, with some exceptions. Additionally, it suggested expanding the writ jurisdiction of High Courts.It has also raised serious questions about the structure of the Constitutional Council, though it has not given exact measures to restructure it.“The fact that all members of the Constitutional Council, except for the chief justice, are political office holders raises concerns that political influence could affect the appointments recommended by the council. Moreover, the council’s decisions have often become controversial and subject to judicial review, leading to the question of whether the presence of judicial leadership in the council is appropriate,” reads the report.“A detailed study should be conducted to determine whether judicial leadership is necessary on the Constitutional Council, and conclusions should be drawn based on the findings.”It has also questioned the need for a parliamentary hearing. It has argued that such hearings could introduce political influence into the judiciary.“The arrangement for parliamentary hearings for Supreme Court justices has raised serious concerns about the political influence on the judiciary. Therefore, it would be appropriate to conduct a separate, detailed study to conclude this matter,” it says.The provision for parliamentary hearings, as set out in the constitution, was intended to prevent arbitrary judicial appointments and ensure that justices are approved by the people. However, the report questioned whether the hearings serve this purpose, as some individuals with questionable backgrounds have still been appointed despite the process.

Lamichhane and Joshi, who were initially held in Pokhara police custody, have been under investigation for their involvement in misappropriating funds from Supreme Savings and Credit Cooperative in Butwal.Meanwhile, the district court in Kaski has extended the custody of Lamichhane and Joshi for seven days to facilitate further investigation. Former DIG Joshi, who was brought to Rupandehi for a 13-hour interrogation, has been sent back to Pokhara, while preparations are underway to bring Lamichhane to Rupandehi on Friday.Authorities are probing into the illegal transfer of Rs25 million under Joshi’s name and Rs20 million under RSP chair Lamichhane’s name from Supreme Cooperative to Gorkha Media Network. Additionally, an investigation report by a special parliamentary committee led by lawmaker Surya Thapa revealed that Rs142.9 million was transferred unlawfully from the Butwal-based Supreme Cooperative to the accounts of the media company, co-founded by Lamichhane and GB Rai, among others.Out of the Rs1.07 billion deposited by 10,391 account holders in Supreme Cooperative, Rs780 million was found to have been misappropriated. Following initial investigations, Rupandehi police had already filed a case against 28 individuals, including the cooperative’s chairman, Om Prakash Gurung, who is in custody, while other key figures such as Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, Bhupendra Babu Rai, and manager Sagar KC remain at large. Several others have been released on bail. ","summary":"The Rupandehi District Court has granted permission to investigate Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who is also former managing director of Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd, and Chhabilal Joshi, vice-chair of the media company, in connection with an organised crime case. The court on Thursday also allowed police to arrest 12 other individuals involved in the case, according to sources.Judge Shyam Prasad Shrestha’s bench approved the arrest and investigation of Lamichhane, Joshi, and others in connection with a large-scale cooperative fraud. Lamichhane and Joshi, who were initially held in Pokhara police custody, have been under investigation for their involvement in misappropriating funds from Supreme Savings and Credit Cooperative in Butwal.Meanwhile, the district court in Kaski has extended the custody of Lamichhane and Joshi for seven days to facilitate further investigation.

A central secretariat meeting of the party that Oli chaired on October 20 decided to seek clarification from the party’s standing committee member Binda Pandey, central committee member Ushakiran Timsena, and former vice-chair Bhim Rawal for “speaking against the party’s interest”. Their crime? Criticising the chair’s decision to accept donation from a controversial businessman. Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the largest retail chain in Nepal, the Bhatbhateni Supermarket, had just provided land and announced plans to build a sophisticated office building for the communist party. This didn’t sit well with some UML leaders as Gurung is someone against whom multiple corruption and forgery cases are sub-judice in the court.Nepal’s top politicians don’t tire of preaching to people about their commitment and contribution to democracy, freedom of expression and equality. They often boast of fighting for decades against kings’ autocratic rule. “We fought for democracy and we accept only democracy”, Oli said in a meeting of the ruling parties on Wednesday. In his televised address to the nation later in the afternoon, he spoke of “the long struggle and contribution of Nepali Congress and CPN-UML for democracy”. But waning intra-party democracy in his own party gives a lie to such commitments. Oli however was a different leader before he became the party chief in 2014. He fought against the autocratic tendencies of the then UML leadership and strongly criticised some decisions of the party establishments when Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal led the party. At times, he even challenged the party’s official decisions and forced the establishment to correct them with the backing of a strong faction he led. Those from the party establishment often blamed him for running a parallel organisation within the mother party. But when he took the helm a decade ago, he suddenly started displaying authoritarian tendencies, much more so than his predecessors. In the Chitwan general convention held in November 2021, aspiring to be the unopposed party chair, he attempted to bar any leader from challenging his candidacy. He instructed party delegates to rubber stamp the list of office bearers he had prepared. A group of leaders led by Bhim Rawal and Ghanashyam Bhusal insisted on election of the leadership through voting. Later, Oli ruthlessly sidelined the two leaders. Eventually, Bhusal quit the party while Rawal’s role was curtailed. In private conversations, some UML leaders, who used to strongly support Oli in the past, now express frustration over his arbitrary and autocratic working style. They say they earlier supported Oli as he fought against the party establishment and helped democratise the UML. Before him, the party was hailed for its rigorous democratic practices in leadership selection and decision making, from the local to the top level. Frustrated, even staunch supporters of Oli such as Gokul Baskota and Karna Bahadur Thapa have now distanced themselves from him. Standing committee member Pandey, who always supported Oli in intra-party struggles, is now Oli’s latest target. It will be hard for people to believe that their prime minister, who brutally suppresses dissent in his own party, is committed to democratic norms and values when it comes to governing the country.

This meeting is important as countries constantly align and realign their interests, trying all opportunities to cooperate while avoiding strategic entanglement in great power rivalry. The SCO, which emerged and entered into force in 2003 in the post-Soviet space, has expanded over time. Originally mooted by China and Russia to counter Western strategic influence in the Central Asia and Eurasian region, it was designed as a geo-strategic organisation to succeed the Shanghai Five formed in 1996. Its focus was on countering the ‘three evils’—terrorism, extremism and separatism. The organisation later expanded, including India and Pakistan as its members in 2017. It is now a regionally anchored multifaceted cooperation with a 10-member organisation responsible for playing a key role as regional multilateralism becomes the norm in international politics. There are three observer countries and 14 dialogue partners, including Nepal and Sri Lanka. India has strongly advocated ‘reformed multilateralism’ and has longstandingly advocated UN Security Council reform. It also emphasises that member states must demonstrate commitment to the SCO Charter rather than cherry-picking issues.Enhancing economic cooperationInitially, the organisation focused on economic cooperation and established transport linkages to bolster trade and economic ties. Except for India, all other member states are part of China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). India continues to emphasise that any transport corridor requires respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty. China’s economic push to the Central Asian Region, at times, has made the Russians uncomfortable. However, given the dynamics of the West, mainly the United States’ approach to both Russia and China, which is believed to be a containment strategy, has brought the two countries closer in the strategic realm. In this context, the SCO is seen as a vehicle for expanding economic relations with an underlying strategic content. India, which has a deeper economic interest, is also concerned about terrorism and extremism that branches out of this geo-political space. It can potentially destabilise India’s efforts to advance the ‘Connect Central Asia policy’ of 2012 and the proposed International North South Transport Corridor (INSCTC) to connect to the larger Eurasian region. India’s access to Central Asia has been through Iran, where it has invested in the Chahbahar Port, a strategic gateway to enhance its economic engagement with the Eurasian region.According to media reports, the SCO countries possess “25 percent of the world's oil reserves, over 50 percent of the world's gas reserves, 35 percent of the world's coal reserves, and roughly 50 percent of the world's known uranium reserves”. India has emphasised collaborative connectivity, which includes industrial cooperation to enhance competitiveness and expand labour markets, micro, small and medium enterprises collaboration and access to affordable pharmaceutical capabilities. Though Pakistan emphasised the ‘SCO connectivity framework’ in the recent summit, it has remained a major stumbling block in allowing India overland connectivity to Central Asia and Afghanistan through Pakistan due to geopolitics and regional rivalry.Evolving strategic spaceThe emergence of the Central Asian Republic for the first time provided the US with a window of opportunity to expand its geo-strategic influence over this region. However, Russia was extremely careful in nurturing its geo-strategic space. It did not want the Central Asian Republics to emerge as a challenge to Russia’s hegemonic presence and influence in the region. The Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) emerged as a forum to have a coordinated effort to deal with security challenges confronting the region. Nonetheless, Russia’s war with Ukraine has limited its ability to come to the rescue of other countries in the region, especially Armenia, in its border conflict with Azerbaijan. This has provided Beijing with an opportunity to step up security cooperation. In May 2023, it convened the first China-Central Asia summit in Xi'an to cooperate on security matters.The United States’ exit from Afghanistan allowed the SCO to emerge as an effective regional player. It has a Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS), SCO-led military exercises, a SCO Contact Group for Afghanistan and Cooperation on combatting drug trafficking. Afghanistan remains a major security concern for the SCO members, and RATS has been at the forefront of combating such security challenges. Several terrorist and extremist groups operating out of Afghanistan pose a threat to the internal stability of the member countries, given the international terror network that has spawned to carry out attacks. International terrorist groups like Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), Daish and al-Qaeda are entrenching their base in Afghanistan, which is believed to be under the patronage of the Taliban. Yet, the SCO has a cautious approach to Afghanistan. Some countries have preferred to engage the Taliban to deal with terror threats. The recent attacks in Moscow and Pakistan illustrate why engaging Afghanistan is important for some member states. Anti-terrorism Interaction-2024 joint exercise of the SCO member states held in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region also demonstrates the growing threat of terrorism.Relevance of the SCOAnalysts have often differed on the relevance of the SCO from the member-country’s perspectives. In the post-Cold War period, such regional multilateral organisations mushroomed and were seen as forums to advance collective interest. The SCO needs to be taken into account in the larger geopolitical context. The competitive interests of member countries certainly hinder the potential of any multilateral organisations, as there is a balancing game when granting membership to certain countries. However, it is important to recognise the relevance of such organisations, especially in combatting transnational crime. The SCO’s relevance as a Eurasian organisation is poised to further its economic interest through its connectivity projects and collaboration among private corporate players by providing a conducive environment to invest while dealing with larger security issues arising from terrorism threats. The organisation would remain relevant as a geopolitical and geo-economic vehicle to allow member states to pursue their common interests in an era of strategic flux.

The monsoon is a double-edged sword for the country, bringing blessings and hardships. On the positive side, the rains sustain agriculture, replenish vital water resources and support the livelihoods of millions in rural areas. However, the same torrential rains also unleash destructive floods and landslides, causing significant damage to life, property and infrastructure. The situation is often exacerbated by human-induced factors, such as unplanned urbanisation, deforestation and poorly managed infrastructure development, which obstruct the natural water flow and worsen the impact of monsoon-related disasters.In 2024, Nepal experienced record-breaking rainfall in September, surpassing a 50-year precedent. The heavy rains triggered severe floods and landslides across the country, with 26 of Nepal's 77 districts being severely affected. In response to the scale of the devastation, the government declared these districts disaster crisis zones, allowing for a faster mobilisation of resources and relief efforts. The floods damaged roads, destroyed bridges, disrupted drinking water supplies and crippled telecommunications networks, leaving thousands of people stranded and vulnerable. Moreover, 16 hydropower plants, responsible for generating 667.9 MW of electricity, were severely damaged, along with key transmission lines, further crippling Nepal's already fragile energy sector.The human toll of the disaster was profound. A total of 244 lives were lost, 19 people were reported missing, and 179 others were injured. Over 17,774 individuals were rescued by government and security forces, including the Nepal Army, Armed Police Force and local volunteers. Despite their efforts, relief distribution was slow, leaving many families waiting for essential assistance. The government pledged Rs200,000 in compensation to families who had lost loved ones, and financial support was directed to local units for disaster management. However, the sheer scale of the disaster overwhelmed the government's capacity to respond effectively.The economic consequences of the disaster were equally devastating. The estimated financial losses exceeded Rs17 billion, with damage of Rs6 billion in the agriculture sector alone. As agriculture is the backbone of Nepal’s rural economy, the disruption is expected to increase food imports, further widening the country's trade deficit. The energy sector, already under strain, suffered Rs4 billion worth of damages, which will likely force Nepal to import electricity from India to compensate for the loss in hydropower production. Additionally, tourism, another vital sector of the economy, was negatively impacted, and the increased budgetary pressure on the government will worsen an already delicate fiscal situation.As a result of the disaster, Nepal’s GDP is projected to contract by 1 percent, representing a loss of Rs57 billion. This will also reduce the country’s economic growth rate, which was previously estimated at 4.9 percent by the Asian Development Bank. With the increased debt obligations and a growing trade deficit, Nepal's economic outlook remains precarious.The international community responded swiftly to Nepal’s crisis. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed solidarity with Nepal, assuring that India would stand by Nepal in its time of need and offer all possible cooperation to help overcome the disaster. India, Nepal’s immediate neighbour, quickly dispatched essential supplies, including medicines, food, hygiene products and emergency equipment. India's significant role in Nepal’s disaster management has been recognised globally, particularly for its assistance during the 2015 and 2023 earthquakes in Jajarkot. China also expressed condolences for the human casualties and property losses caused by the disaster. Additionally, China provided emergency supplies, including blankets, rice, and other essential goods for those affected. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Russia, also expressed their grief. Beyond bilateral support, international organisations also played a critical role in disaster relief efforts. The World Bank approved $150 million in emergency funding to support victims affected by the floods and landslides. Numerous other donor agencies and countries offered financial aid, highlighting the global concern for Nepal’s plight.However, the disaster emphasised significant weaknesses in Nepal’s disaster preparedness. The damage was intensified by inadequate infrastructure and unregulated construction in vulnerable areas. The government’s short-term rescue and relief efforts weren’t that effective, and long-term planning to address disaster risk reduction remains largely underdeveloped.Monsoon-induced disasters are not a new challenge for Nepal; however, climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of such events. The 2024 floods underscore the urgent need for comprehensive disaster management policies that prioritise disaster preparedness, sustainable urban development, and environmental conservation.Moving forward, the Nepali government must focus on several critical areas. First, enhancing early warning systems is essential to ensure communities receive timely information about potential floods and landslides. Second, investing in flood management infrastructure—such as embankments, retention basins and better drainage systems—helps mitigate the effects of heavy rainfall. Third, construction activities should be regulated in flood-prone areas to prevent the uncontrolled development that often leads to increased disaster vulnerability.Additionally, Nepal must also focus on sustainable land-use practices. Reforestation initiatives and the promotion of sustainable agriculture can help restore ecosystems and reduce the risk of landslides while also improving the resilience of rural communities to future monsoon-induced disasters. Furthermore, long-term collaboration with international donors and organisations will be critical in rebuilding stronger and more resilient communities.Nepal can draw valuable lessons from past mistakes to inform proactive measures for the future. Prioritising disaster risk reduction and investing in sustainable development, Nepal can better prepare for the monsoon season and ensure that rainfall’s benefits are maximised while minimising the devastating consequences of floods and landslides.

In the digital landscape, children are regularly exposed to things that aren’t accessible in real life. While children are more tech-savvy than ever, there is a glaring lack of awareness on the potential dangers of the virtual world. According to a report by The Guardian, each year, more than 300 million children worldwide become victims of online sexual exploitation and abuse. In Nepal, in under two months of the fiscal year 2024-2025, the Cyber Bureau recorded 68 cybercrime cases involving children. It logged 635 cases in the previous fiscal year, 2023-24—a 260.8 percent rise from the 176 cases in the fiscal year 2022-23. This is concerning for a nation where per capita internet usage is greater than in some developed nations even as its digital literacy rates are low. Many Nepali parents do not hesitate to give their devices to their children to keep them engaged. This practice is hardly shocking in a country where most parents themselves are digitally illiterate. This exposes the children to harmful online spaces at a very young age. Children are naturally curious and seek validation, so people easily manipulate them online. Predators groom them into sharing nudes and personal information and even meeting in real life. The offences can turn into blackmail and threats or sextortion, where abusers demand money from the victim to keep images private, scarring the children for life. Usually, the number of crime reports does not reflect the reality as many children keep it to themselves and suffer silently. These days, children are often more comfortable making friends online than in real life. There are ample online dating and chatting sites, gaming apps and social media platforms where one can communicate with strangers. In many cases, online sexual abuse culminates in real-life sexual violence. According to a Post report, a 13-year-old girl was sexually abused online and later raped by a 20-year-old man whom she met through an online gaming app, FreeFire. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence, child sexual exploitation online is taking new heights with deepfake and other generative AI content. According to the Internet Watch Foundation, the amount of AI-made illegal content related to child sexual abuse over the past six months has already exceeded the previous year’s total. Moreover, it also states how the dark web isn’t the only problem, as almost all the content found was on publicly available areas online. While Nepal has implemented laws to combat online child abuse, these regulations are nowhere near enough to oversee the rapidly evolving technologies. The Electronic Transactions Act 2008 does not explicitly address online child sexual abuse. Moreover, the Act Relating to Children 2018 fails to define child pornography, grooming, sextortion or cyberstalking, which are recurring activities involved in online child sexual abuse. The Ministry of Women, Citizens and Senior Citizens in 2021 approved the Online Child Protection Procedure in 2021, where restricting children’s access to harmful content online was stated as the duty of internet service providers; however, that hasn’t been effective. This is why it is vital that our legal mechanisms are strengthened and simple and accessible child-friendly online safety resources created. Additionally, it is imperative to spread awareness of online abuse and sexual exploitation through school curriculums. As children are exposed to online risks, even within the comfort of their homes, parents must realise that safeguarding them in the physical world is not enough.

Such details should be sent to the National Vigilance Centre within 2 months. It is an old practice to publish such details.Section 50 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 2002 also states that people in public positions shall submit their property statement within 60 days of assuming public office and at the end of each fiscal year.“Whoever joins a public office shall, within 60 days from the date of joining the public office, and whoever is engaged in a public office on the date of commencement of this section shall, within 60 days from the date of commencement of this Act, and after that, within 60 days from the date of completion of each fiscal year, submit the updated statement of property in his/her name or the name of his/her family members, along with the sources or evidence thereof, to the body of authority,” reads the Act.However, subsection 50(4) of the same Act also states that the submitted property details may be confidential.Since the constitution protects a person’s property, disclosing it depends on personal discretion.

I want to assure you all that the government is now moving forward with a plan to process excess milk into powdered milk to avoid any future milk holidays,” he stated.The minister also admitted that while he initially aimed to prevent the conditions leading to milk holidays, he has since adjusted his stance. “From mid-August to mid-October, milk production increases significantly, and we reach a situation where we have to stop buying milk from farmers,” Adhikari explained, adding that such circumstances have forced the imposition of milk holidays.Adhikari criticised the current system where a state agency buys milk from farmers on credit, sells it for a profit of Rs30–35 per litre in cash, and yet fails to pay the farmers promptly. “It’s disheartening that farmers are left without payment while consumers are charged in cash. How can my words carry weight in such a situation?” he lamented. However, he assured that the Ministry of Agriculture is now quite conscious to prevent such malpractice in the future.Chitwan alone produces 350,000 litres of milk daily, with 40,000 farmers engaged in the dairy business and 110 dairy cooperatives operating in the region.

Additionally, 142 people have sustained various degrees of injury, and more than 4,222 others have been taken to safe places, the Home Ministry said on Monday evening. Doctors warn that the risk of water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne disease outbreaks increases in the aftermath of disasters. Nepal’s past experiences suggest the same.“People are already contracting cholera and other water-borne diseases,” said Dr Pun. “As displaced people mostly live in temporary shelters, the chances of spread of air-borne and vector-borne diseases remain high.”At least 95 people from various districts, including from Kathmandu and Lalitpur, have tested positive for cholera since the start of the monsoon in June. The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Thousands of others were also infected with diarrheal infections after the start of the monsoon season. Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health issue, usually triggered by unsafe food and water or hygiene issues. Likewise, six people died, and 12,644 others were hospitalised this year due to dengue, which has spread to 76 out of 77 districts across the country. Hundreds of people are contracting seasonal flu, but health authorities have no records of these cases.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are bracing for tough days ahead, as the floodwaters not only contaminate drinking water sources but also create breeding grounds for various disease-spreading vectors.“We expect a surge in water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases in the coming days, as it takes a few days for these illnesses to incubate,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have alerted all agencies concerned to step up vigilance and prepare to deal with any adverse situations.”Public health experts have warned that healthcare facilities in the disaster-hit districts could witness an uptick in cases of viral fever cases and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning—and snakebites.Health Ministry officials say that they are aware of the risks and have directed agencies concerned to prepare accordingly.“We have stockpiled essential medicines in districts, provinces and at the central level,” said Dr Roshan Pokhrel, the secretary at the ministry. “Responding to the looming outbreaks is not only the responsibility of the Health Ministry, but also of other ministries and agencies, and we have been coordinating with them as well.”In addition to stepping up surveillance measures, stockpiling medicines, and deploying medics at the health facilities in disaster-hit areas, public health experts emphasise the importance of health awareness in reducing infections.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining hygiene and sanitation, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the possible outbreaks of various ailments.The monsoon in Nepal is itself a season of epidemics with thousands of people across the country getting infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The country is one of the world’s most vulnerable to the climate crisis and has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that the maximum temperature in Nepal is rising at a greater rate (0.056 degrees Celsius per year) than the global average of 0.03 degrees Celsius per year.Experts say extreme weather events—excess rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.In recent years, scientists have gathered credible evidence linking the climate crisis to adverse health effects that impact the quality of life and kill people.

Even though prices have not increased in India, some opportunist traders have been taking advantage of the poor market monitoring to increase prices under different pretexts. For example, on September 14, India raised the basic import tax on crude and refined edible oils by 20 percent. Nepali importers seized this opportunity to hike their prices even though Nepal had not raised the import tax.Dhurba Prasad Adhikari, joint treasurer of the Nepal Retailers Association, said Nepali wholesalers and retailers have already raised the prices. “It has been a week since edible oil price was increased by Rs20 per litre and the price is expected to increase further as the festive demand kicks in,” he said. But he admits that market rumours and weak inspections make prices more unstable, especially during the festive season when demand is at its peak.According to the association, sunflower oil prices have increased from Rs190 to Rs210 per litre. Likewise, the per litre price of mustard oil has gone up from Rs350 to Rs370.Adhikari, who operates Adhikari Khadya Store, said the price of edible oil is expected to increase in Tihar due to high demand.Retailers said strict inspections in large trading houses could help stabilise prices during the festive season. Consumer rights activists say the current government inspections of the market are just for show and will not address issues related to price, quality, and quantity.“The government’s market inspection body is looking only at retail markets. They, too, know this will not change prices unless they also inspect the warehouses of large importers and traders,” Adhikari said. He said that the government inspecting body needs to check on the stock of goods held by traders.According to retailers, even with the new rice harvesting beginning soon, prices of the staple have increased by Rs100 kg for a 25 kg bag.Even the price of sona mansuli, which normally remains at Rs60 per kg, has now inched up to Rs70 to Rs75 per kg.Rice prices, however, are expected to decline after the arrival of the new harvest.Sugar is now being sold at Rs120 per kg and expected to rise further, retailers said.As private sector traders say they are out of sugar stock and both state supply utilities—the Salt Trading Corporation and the Food Management and Trading Company—have delayed opening the tender to import the sweetener, according to market insiders, the price is expected to cross Rs160 per kg by Tihar.However, retailers said the jeera (cumin seed) price has declined. But the price could still go up in the next two weeks.Last year during Dashain, the price of jeera, an indispensable spice, spiked from Rs1,400 to Rs1,500 per kg. The price has declined, and it is being transacted around Rs950 per kg this year, Adhikari said. Prices of lentils and legumes tend to fluctuate based on international production, but have remained high in recent months.According to the association, pulses have reached Rs180 per kg from Rs175 per kg.Adhikari said food prices have been increasing every year. “The rice prices are so high that people are buying only what they need in smaller quantities,” said Adhikari.“The government needs to intervene in the market, particularly inspect the large traders engaged in unscrupulous market activities,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum. “Proper inspection will help bring the prices down. It will also help the government bring in more revenues,” he said.As the government has started operating fair-price shops across the country, there might be some relief for consumers, Maharjan said. “But such subsidised shops should be operated year-round to control market prices.”    ","summary":"As the festive season approaches, prices of daily essentials like rice, edible oil, legumes, and lentils have increased.Retailers say food prices are expected to stay high throughout Dashain and Tihar, Nepal’s biggest festivals.In Nepal, food prices are heavily influenced by the Indian market.

Arriving here just before the 2022 elections, he has since closely observed Nepali politics and society. Umesh Chauhan and Biswas Baral recently sat down with Thompson to reflect on his time in Nepal, major US projects in the country including those under the MCC, geopolitical competition with China, trade, and a range of other issues.How have you seen Nepali politics evolve in the two years you have been in the country? What events stood out? I’ve seen a lot of Nepali politics. Obviously, there’s been a lot of changes. I got here right before the national elections in November 2022. It was really great to see the democratic process play out here, to see Nepalis turn out in such great numbers and make their choices known.Democracy is such a vibrant and colourful exercise anywhere in the world. Nepal did not disappoint on that front. It's been fascinating to watch it evolve, to watch the governments come in different formations.What’s been great is the commitment we’ve seen from successive groups in government to moving forward and carrying forward the [bilateral] partnership and building on projects. I’ve also been amazed at some of the innovative things happening in various sectors of the economy.There has been some very exciting work in the IT sector, for example, that runs the gamut from more traditional back-office type operations to cutting-edge AI research, to developing educational apps for school students, to things like what we have been sponsoring at our Content Creator’s Mela these past two years. It is great to see Nepalis show lots of creativity in expressing themselves and talking about their culture and their society in so many different ways. Across the board, I’d say the experience has been unique.How have the Nepal-US relations evolved over the past 77 years of diplomatic ties? What are the salient features of the relationship? What I would say is we’ve always tried to listen, to engage with the Nepali society. Based on that, I think one of the things that we’ve done is refine the range of products.The Peace Corps, the USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Development Finance Corporation, or other elements of our assistance and development commitments—these are different tools that can be employed. And Nepal has continually expanded its capacity to take advantage of them. The US has been able to increase the number of tools and assets, if you will, that Nepal can use to build its economy.I’m very proud of the fact that we have done this primarily through grant-based assistance, so that there is little in terms of downsides. At the same time, we have focused on different segments of the economy or society, for example, through the Development Finance Corporation, we’re now able to target and work with the financial sector to create more opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly women-run enterprises. Through the USAID, we can use more of the traditional mechanisms of assistance.The Millennium Challenge Corporation kind of speaks for itself. It targets large-scale, massive infrastructure type projects that aim to be transformative in terms of Nepal’s economy. It has helped grow the road and infrastructure network and show new technology that can help expand that network and make roads safer, more reliable, and easier to maintain. It has helped build an electricity infrastructure that allows Nepal, first and foremost, to internally use the green hydropower that's at its disposal, but there will be excess capacity even to export it to the region to earn additional income. So I’m pretty excited about what I’ve seen happen over the past 77 years, and where we are today. I’m also extremely positive about building on where we are now. Can you give us a status of the implementation of projects under the Millennium Challenge Account Nepal? In the MCC, energy, obviously, is a high-priority area and so is transportation. Where we are with the projects themselves is we have let out the contracts for the sub-stations, for the 18-kilometre cross-border transmission line, and we have reissued the tender for the 297-kilometre broader transmission line package that had to be revised due to some cost changes over the time it took to implement that piece of the package.But we’re pretty positive about getting that back on track by the end of the year and putting the project firmly on the right footing for a five-year completion timeline. But there have also been hurdles, right? Do you still expect the transmission lines and road projects to be completed in five years?I expect there to be more hurdles. The biggest challenge was when the bids came back for the 297-kilometre transmission line. We had a number of delays there from Covid to worldwide inflation, to supply chain shifts that I don’t think people had foreseen completely. I’m not surprised. But the MCC has had a lot of experience around the world with these projects.It builds into this assumption that there will be challenges, there will be situations that need to be rethought and overcome. The real trick is making sure we move forward in a way that’s smart and focused on keeping things on time and on track. We're fortunate in the case of Nepal because we have a partner that has so heavily invested its own resources into the project.We have our $500 million grant and Nepal is putting in almost $200 million. It’s been made a national pride project. Look, other things will inevitably come up. But we believe that we have a good team that’s ready to tackle those types of challenges and press forward.At the end of the day, this can serve as a really positive model for how development assistance and how large-scale infrastructure projects can be implemented in a partnership that is largely the result of an internal domestic process. Don’t forget, Nepal requested the MCC project. The government of Nepal, through a consultative process, developed the idea, designed the project, and is now its lead implementer.We’re a financier and a partner but it is very much a Nepal-owned effort. Talking about challenges, there are many local governments and we have to deal with them every 10 to 15 kilometres in the project areas. Different communities have different concerns and priorities. This can add to some difficulty.What do you think will happen to the project if it cannot meet the five-year deadline?The fate of the project is to be completed in its entirety in five years. I can't speak to whether there’s going to be a particular challenge to delay it by six months or seven months or something like that. Right now, in our planning and projection, we hope that we can move it forward within the timeline.If it needs to go beyond that, we’ll work closely with our partner and figure it out. I’m confident that the $500 million that the US government is providing will be spent within the five years and it will lay a firm foundation for the completion of the project.But coming back to your scenario, indeed, you have different communities. A lot of people are affected by this. Now, on the one hand, that's why we encourage and insist on a consultative process, on everything being as transparent as possible so people know exactly what’s going to happen, that they know what the money is being spent on, what the effects will be in terms of how many trees will have to be cut down or what roads will be built where. That’s very important to us: no surprises for the communities that are out there.I think that we will rely on a lot of that effort to help us propel the project forward if things do get challenging on other fronts as well.Like you said, the project does need to be completed by a deadline of five years. Just in case it doesn’t, what happens?Look, it is an ambitious undertaking. There’s no question about it, right? And the Millennium Challenge Corporation is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. The MCA Nepal is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. But they’re also working closely together to make sure that it’s being done in a proper way, in a transparent way, and I’m confident that we will be able to complete what we need to complete. I’m also sure there’s a firm commitment from the government that if there’s a little piece left over here or there, to make sure it goes forward.I don’t worry about the ultimate completion of the project. I’m more focused on how we get it going as quickly as possible, because just the implementation of the project itself should employ close to 10,000 Nepalis, right? I really want communities to start to see the benefit of the project as soon as possible, because that’s where the transformative nature of it comes into play. Part of it is building it. Part of it is implementing it. Part of it is learning from that process. But then having this infrastructure in place, that’s what really changes the dynamic in Nepal and in the economic well-being of the country.Some fear that a failure to complete the project on time could even create rifts in our bilateral ties.I don’t think they should be fearful. We are partners in this, and if there’s any issue, if we're going to work through it together. What we should be doing is focusing entirely on implementing the project to its fullest potential as quickly as possible.Let’s move to geopolitics. What we see in the region is seemingly an exclusivist India-China geopolitical competition. Indians appear reluctant to work with the regimes that work closely with China. It's almost like they are saying, it's either the Chinese or us. How do you see this geopolitical dynamics playing out in Nepal? And where do the Americans fit in this picture?Yeah, it’s a good question in terms of the dynamic that’s in play today and where things are headed. We have of course been watching the India-China relationship and its development over the past few years with some degree of concern. Obviously, there was conflict there some years ago, and I think they’ve been trying to manage that since.And there’s no question that other countries in the region feel that very powerfully. From our standpoint, what we would like to see is the countries of the region—and particularly Nepal because that’s where I’m accredited and that’s where I have some level of knowledge—exercise their sovereignty and to have the space that they need to make decisions about they own future on behalf of their people in a positive way.We don’t believe countries should be asked to choose. We fully expect that Nepal is going to have good relations with India and China. They’re two neighbours. They’re large countries. They’re important countries in the region. It’s critically important for Nepal that it works with and benefits from both India and China.At the same time, we see no reason that should have any effect on our relationship with Nepal, and no reason Nepal should not be fully able to take full advantage of what the US has to offer. We will continue to watch and continue to work closely with Nepal as a partner and to encourage it to exercise its sovereignty and its decision-making in a way that benefits the Nepali people. The US-China relations are also very dicey at the moment. Surely this has some effect on how the US perceives the Chinese role around the world, including in Nepal.We had a recent high-level visit by our National Security Advisor [to China]. We’ve had recent visits by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Treasury. I think there’s a real effort to try to manage what we all acknowledge is as a competition that’s underway, in a way that’s positive and can maybe move us more towards some type of cooperative element.That channel should continue to be pursued by the US and China, but it’s not reflective of our relationship with Nepal, or our relationship with India. This is about what we can do together [with Nepal]. I’m not going to comment on what other countries may be saying about us, how they may be trying to influence us.I would commit to us remaining as transparent as possible so Nepalis can make their own decisions about what's happening by our relationship.Recently, the Americans were blamed for ousting Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh. The US is also often accused of meddling in the domestic affairs of other South Asian states, and in other parts of the world for that matter. How do you respond to this accusation?First off, I think you’ve got to take with a grain of salt anything that’s being said by someone who’s been forced to flee their country. The United States simply does not meddle in the internal politics of other countries. We work very hard to be as transparent as we possibly can about our relationships, about what we’re doing, about what we intend.That’s not to say that if we disagree vehemently with a country about a certain policy or a certain issue, we won’t raise it. But this idea that the US would find some benefit in enacting a change in government like that, it simply isn’t part of our repertoire of diplomacy. What we rather look to do is build the strongest relationships that we can.We love to do that primarily through people-to-people relationships and sponsoring as much development opportunity as we possibly can with our partner countries. So, I put no stock in these types of rumours and statements.There is also this sentiment that the Americans and the Indians are increasingly working together on strategic issues, and the same is seen even in South Asia.Certainly, there’s been a huge growth in the strategic partnership between the US and India. I think we want to see that continue to move forward in a positive way. At the same time, there have been disagreements between the US and India on various fronts, just as we have disagreements with many of our partners. And we try to deal with those in a proactive, professional and productive way.But, again, we see our relationship with each individual country through a bilateral lens. So if there are ways that the US and India working together can be beneficial, and another country agrees to such a cooperation, fine. But when it comes to Nepal, we’re going to base our relationship and our efforts first and foremost on our bilateral discussions and our bilateral relationship.Even as we speak, the US and Nepali armies are undertaking joint training in Nepal. How would you characterise the relations between the two armies?Yeah, the PAC ANGEL exercise is going on, focused on disaster relief, humanitarian assistance. The relationship between the two militaries has been strong, it remains strong, and I think it will continue to be strong primarily because we focus it on the areas Nepal wants to focus on—which is building a Nepal army that is capable of responding to disasters, providing humanitarian assistance, and then serving as part of the global peacekeeping network through the United Nations as the largest contributor force of peacekeepers. It’s in our interest to see Nepal continue to professionalise and develop its capacity on those fronts. That’s where our focus is, and that’s where we will continue to make efforts.There has also been a lot of debate in Nepal on the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and its applicability to South Asia. What is the current state of its application?The Indo-Pacific Strategy is a broad, big strategy by the United States government about how it looks at the entire region. And so it’s about how we create an open, independent, sovereign Indo-Pacific region for the benefit of all the people in the region.What we will continue to do is employ it to build relationships we have with each of the countries in the region. How can we continue to support democratic development? How can we continue to support economic development? Let’s not forget a huge portion, maybe 60 percent of the world’s commerce transits the Indo-Pacific corridor in some way, shape, or form every year.It’s in everyone’s interest for that to remain open and free. And for the countries of the region to be able to act in a sovereign way in their own interests.There is also a sizable section of Nepalis who believe that the IPS was brought with the intent of countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and that Nepal is struggling to find a balance between the two. What is your reading?The USAID, the MCC, the Development Finance Corporation, all of our development programmes have a singular purpose, which is to work with our bilateral partners to grow their economies, to make them more able to meet the needs of their people. That’s the goal. That's how they were designed. And that’s how we will continue to treat them.The BRI is China's initiative. It’s pushing that forward. It’s up to each country to decide how it wants to engage with others. We believe the model of, say, a USAID or an MCC is proving itself to be beneficial to countries, as they are grant-based and economic growth oriented. We’ll continue to push them because we think the data and historical experience we’ve had support them.I think it’s incumbent on us to try to help all of our partners relate to us as equals in any realm that we’re working together. That’s critically important and something we have to acknowledge and something we have to make sure that they’re able to acknowledge.It's about building trust, about showing that our intent is correct, that we have the best interest of our partners in mind, and that we’re applying the same and transparent standards universally.For example, on the MCC, we’ve published everything on the internet. If anybody in Nepal has a question about any aspect of the project, they can go to the website, they can read about the project, they can see the blueprints, they can know exactly what it’s going to involve. That's how I think we build relationships.I think if I came to Nepal and said, hey, I want to do X project because I want to counter this country, I don’t think I would get very good reception. We just don’t look at the world that way. It’s not a healthy approach in the long run.But a bilateral focus that seeks to empower the people of a country—that’s where I think we have the best chance of moving forward. Nepal’s Parliament has finally passed an amendment to the transitional justice law. How does the US see this development? How do you see the transitional justice process progressing?I think this is a really important step in the process. I would say that we remain positive about the way it's going and we are looking to see how we can help. You noted, I’m sure, that we joined a number of other partner countries in issuing a statement of support after the Parliament passed it.We all know bringing a conflict of this scale to conclusion is always going to be a challenge. The TJ legislation has passed, which was a tough hurdle, but implementation will also be difficult.We’re looking forward to figuring out how we can be supportive, and how other partners can be supportive. Some of that may be through bilateral means. Some of it may be through multilateral means.But what I remain encouraged about, in particular, is, we’ve always said this needs to be a Nepali-run process. It has been. That it needs to be victim-centric. I believe that it is. And so we need to make sure the consultative piece of this remains alive as you move to implementation, so that the victims groups, so that the child soldier groups, so that other entities that have been involved continue to have a voice and continue to work together to figure out how to resolve this, to make reparations work, to bring justice in those cases. And so, we are positive.Thousands of Nepali youths are leaving the country every single day in search of better jobs. In this light, do you see the prospect of greater American FDI helping Nepal build a more robust economy that can create enough good jobs?I do. At the beginning of the interview, I talked about some sectors of the economy that are quite exciting right now. I think you’re seeing a lot of interest from the US in the IT sector, the tourism sector, in the health sector, and in the energy sector as it continues to develop.We’re very keen to look for ways to bring more US investment here, whether it’s through equity sort of vehicles, or direct bilateral investments. I think that can also be positive. I think Nepal did a good job in setting up that April Investment Summit. That sent a really positive signal. You’ll recall that we had a representative from the US Chamber of Commerce, Atul Keshap, come out for that. We’ve had a great run of senior US visitors out here over the last year and a half.I think the key right now is for Nepal, through its private sector, through its government, to figure out how to make the environment for investment in Nepal as attractive as it can possibly be. In this interview, we’ve talked about the idea of competition between countries. One place where I will absolutely acknowledge there’s competition is in trying to attract investment.And so Nepal needs to figure out how to make itself as attractive as possible, and how to make it as easy as possible to do business. That helps not only investments that come from other countries, but makes it easier for Nepalis to start businesses, right? It makes it easier for Nepalis to operate and do what they want. And so, in addition to welcoming, say, US companies or British companies or Canadian companies, we would also love to see Nepalis who have gone abroad come back and start to help in building the economy here.We’ve seen how capable and how dynamic they are in building other people’s economies. Let’s do the same here at home.I mentioned that the trade and investment framework talks that we have with Nepal are in their seventh round. I look forward to, in the rest of my tenure here, to continue to build the momentum that will allow investment to take shape and the economy here to thrive. ","summary":"Dean Richard Thompson recently completed his two years as the American ambassador to Nepal. Arriving here just before the 2022 elections, he has since closely observed Nepali politics and society. Umesh Chauhan and Biswas Baral recently sat down with Thompson to reflect on his time in Nepal, major US projects in the country including those under the MCC, geopolitical competition with China, trade, and a range of other issues.How have you seen Nepali politics evolve in the two years you have been in the country? What events stood out? I’ve seen a lot of Nepali politics. Obviously, there’s been a lot of changes. I got here right before the national elections in November 2022. It was really great to see the democratic process play out here, to see Nepalis turn out in such great numbers and make their choices known.Democracy is such a vibrant and colourful exercise anywhere in the world. Nepal did not disappoint on that front. It's been fascinating to watch it evolve, to watch the governments come in different formations.What’s been great is the commitment we’ve seen from successive groups in government to moving forward and carrying forward the [bilateral] partnership and building on projects. I’ve also been amazed at some of the innovative things happening in various sectors of the economy.There has been some very exciting work in the IT sector, for example, that runs the gamut from more traditional back-office type operations to cutting-edge AI research, to developing educational apps for school students, to things like what we have been sponsoring at our Content Creator’s Mela these past two years. It is great to see Nepalis show lots of creativity in expressing themselves and talking about their culture and their society in so many different ways. Across the board, I’d say the experience has been unique.How have the Nepal-US relations evolved over the past 77 years of diplomatic ties? What are the salient features of the relationship? What I would say is we’ve always tried to listen, to engage with the Nepali society. Based on that, I think one of the things that we’ve done is refine the range of products.The Peace Corps, the USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Development Finance Corporation, or other elements of our assistance and development commitments—these are different tools that can be employed. And Nepal has continually expanded its capacity to take advantage of them. The US has been able to increase the number of tools and assets, if you will, that Nepal can use to build its economy.I’m very proud of the fact that we have done this primarily through grant-based assistance, so that there is little in terms of downsides. At the same time, we have focused on different segments of the economy or society, for example, through the Development Finance Corporation, we’re now able to target and work with the financial sector to create more opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly women-run enterprises. Through the USAID, we can use more of the traditional mechanisms of assistance.The Millennium Challenge Corporation kind of speaks for itself. It targets large-scale, massive infrastructure type projects that aim to be transformative in terms of Nepal’s economy. It has helped grow the road and infrastructure network and show new technology that can help expand that network and make roads safer, more reliable, and easier to maintain. It has helped build an electricity infrastructure that allows Nepal, first and foremost, to internally use the green hydropower that's at its disposal, but there will be excess capacity even to export it to the region to earn additional income. So I’m pretty excited about what I’ve seen happen over the past 77 years, and where we are today. I’m also extremely positive about building on where we are now.

It’s not a healthy approach in the long run.But a bilateral focus that seeks to empower the people of a country—that’s where I think we have the best chance of moving forward. Nepal’s Parliament has finally passed an amendment to the transitional justice law. How does the US see this development? How do you see the transitional justice process progressing?I think this is a really important step in the process. I would say that we remain positive about the way it's going and we are looking to see how we can help. You noted, I’m sure, that we joined a number of other partner countries in issuing a statement of support after the Parliament passed it.We all know bringing a conflict of this scale to conclusion is always going to be a challenge. The TJ legislation has passed, which was a tough hurdle, but implementation will also be difficult.We’re looking forward to figuring out how we can be supportive, and how other partners can be supportive. Some of that may be through bilateral means. Some of it may be through multilateral means.But what I remain encouraged about, in particular, is, we’ve always said this needs to be a Nepali-run process. It has been. That it needs to be victim-centric. I believe that it is. And so we need to make sure the consultative piece of this remains alive as you move to implementation, so that the victims groups, so that the child soldier groups, so that other entities that have been involved continue to have a voice and continue to work together to figure out how to resolve this, to make reparations work, to bring justice in those cases. And so, we are positive.Thousands of Nepali youths are leaving the country every single day in search of better jobs. In this light, do you see the prospect of greater American FDI helping Nepal build a more robust economy that can create enough good jobs?I do. At the beginning of the interview, I talked about some sectors of the economy that are quite exciting right now. I think you’re seeing a lot of interest from the US in the IT sector, the tourism sector, in the health sector, and in the energy sector as it continues to develop.We’re very keen to look for ways to bring more US investment here, whether it’s through equity sort of vehicles, or direct bilateral investments. I think that can also be positive. I think Nepal did a good job in setting up that April Investment Summit. That sent a really positive signal. You’ll recall that we had a representative from the US Chamber of Commerce, Atul Keshap, come out for that. We’ve had a great run of senior US visitors out here over the last year and a half.I think the key right now is for Nepal, through its private sector, through its government, to figure out how to make the environment for investment in Nepal as attractive as it can possibly be. In this interview, we’ve talked about the idea of competition between countries. One place where I will absolutely acknowledge there’s competition is in trying to attract investment.And so Nepal needs to figure out how to make itself as attractive as possible, and how to make it as easy as possible to do business. That helps not only investments that come from other countries, but makes it easier for Nepalis to start businesses, right? It makes it easier for Nepalis to operate and do what they want. And so, in addition to welcoming, say, US companies or British companies or Canadian companies, we would also love to see Nepalis who have gone abroad come back and start to help in building the economy here.We’ve seen how capable and how dynamic they are in building other people’s economies. Let’s do the same here at home.I mentioned that the trade and investment framework talks that we have with Nepal are in their seventh round. I look forward to, in the rest of my tenure here, to continue to build the momentum that will allow investment to take shape and the economy here to thrive.

He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well.

However, years later, thousands of people from across the country are getting infected with diarrheal diseases, including scores from cholera.Rautahat is among the nine districts reporting cholera outbreaks this year. Ward 4 of Rajpur Municipality has reported over 100 cases of diarrheal infection and hospitalisation. However, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said only 12 people from the municipality had so far contracted cholera.“Over 100 diarrheal patients from the municipality’s ward 4 have been hospitalised,” Khusid Ahmad, a health worker at the municipality, told the Post over the phone from Rautahat. “Contaminated drinking water could be the culprit for the cholera outbreak there. Samples of drinking water collected from affected areas have been sent for lab tests.”Apart from Rautahat, eight other districts—Lalitpur, Kathmandu, Kailali, Pyuthan, Makawanpur, Rolpa, Sindhupalchok, and Achham—have also reported cholera outbreaks this year. So far, the number of diarrheal patients who have contracted cholera is 95. Interestingly, most of the districts that have witnessed outbreaks of deadly cholera this year had years ago been declared open defecation-free.The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Doctors say that detected cases of cholera infection could be just the tip of the iceberg, as most positive cases are being reported from the districts with active surveillance.Public health experts say outbreaks of cholera in multiple districts, even five years after the country was declared open defecation-free, show a huge gap between official declarations and progress on the ground.They say outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, including cholera, are directly linked to drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, and the country was declared open defecation-free without improving water and sanitation conditions.“Without ensuring the quality of drinking water and sanitation, among other things, authorities rushed to declare the entire country free from open defecation,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Instead of improving basic water and sanitation infrastructure, we’ve focussed too much on outbreak management, and this is the wrong approach.”Even though toilets have been built in most households, open defecation is still widespread in many places. Drinking water samples collected from various parts of the country, including from the districts of the Kathmandu Valley, have been found contaminated with faecal coliform, which means the water the public uses for drinking is unsafe. The presence of faecal coliform, a microscopic organism that thrives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces, indicates sewage contamination in the drinking water, according to doctors.A previous study had shown that 81 percent of water samples collected in the Kathmandu Valley were contaminated with deadly microbes.“We only focussed on expanding coverage of drinking water but did not pay attention to ensuring its safety,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Authorities concerned must also focus on improving the quality.”Experts say improving public hygiene is essential to ensuring water quality and avoiding diarrheal ailments. Awareness drives and health education play a crucial role in changing behaviours, which requires years of investment and continuous efforts.Along with investment in health education, attention should go to building climate-resilient infrastructures for drinking water and sanitation, as water resources have been contaminated by floodwaters in many districts. The effects of climate change have increased adverse events, including floods, which in turn have contaminated the source of drinking water, making people vulnerable to infection with diarrheal ailments.“Multiple agencies of the three tiers of government and non-governmental sectors have to make more effort to prevent diarrhoea outbreaks,” said Sherpa. “But there seems to be a lack of coordination among government agencies.” The World Health Organisation also stresses on a multifaceted approach as a key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths.

They all shared the goal of using art to promote and preserve the unique beauty of Mustang.","summary":"Though born in Manaslu, India, and raised in Chitwan, Nepal, artist Dhwoj Gurung chose to base his career in Mustang, painting landscapes and architecture.Now, for the first time, the International Mountain Art Festival has brought artists from around the world—Thailand, Poland, Romania, Bhutan, Indonesia, and Taiwan—to Mustang to capture the same beauty.“Sharing is beautiful, especially among artists,” Dhwoj says. “I know all of the locations, culture and people, so sharing with other artists is a beautiful feeling.”Tripple P Gurung, a former pilot and Jomsom hotel owner, has been planning the week-long IMAF since June with the help of his friends and colleagues. In addition to painting, the festival, which concluded on Thursday, featured sound healing, fossil hunting, and traditional dances.For years, Tripple P has organised gatherings of Nepali artists in Mustang, but he wanted to go bigger by bringing in artists from around the world.“The whole idea of this is to promote a destination through art and at the same time give a platform to the artists,” he says.Originally from Manang, Tripple P saw his community’s economy suffer due to a lack of tourism during the Maoist insurgency. With a background in marketing, he has worked for decades to promote Mustang as a tourist destination.“My village is all dependent on tourism,” he says. “If there are no tourists, the economy will be bad.” While in Mustang, the 16 painters—nine Nepal-based and seven international—who gathered in Kagbeni had the opportunity to focus solely on their work while drawing inspiration from fellow painters.Kathmandu-based artist Shreejan Rajbhandari came to Mustang once before, 25 years ago, to go trekking with friends, but he didn’t have the opportunity to paint.“It was my dream to come here again, and this is a great opportunity to work with fellow artists,” Rajbhandari says. In addition to producing his work, he learned from the other artists’ techniques at the IMAF.“Artists from different places have their style and are influenced by their land and culture,” Rajbhandari says. “I can see their perceptions of nature–their colour and composition choices.”Thailand-based artists Direk Kingnok and Ekaraj Ohn experienced Mustang for the first time during the festival. “Thailand has a hot climate, which is very different from here,” Ohn says. “I’ve never seen (this region) before in my life; it inspires us.”With 15 years of experience in Mustang, Dhwoj Gurung has, in part, focused on the threat to village life in his work as an artist. He has taken a particular interest in painting the architecture of Mustang because heavy rainfall associated with climate change threatens the mud-based construction materials that hold up many of the buildings in Mustang’s villages. “I’m a little bit afraid we might not be able to see these beautiful buildings in the next generation,” he says. “I’m trying to convey documentation through my paintings.”Kathmandu-based artist Wang Lama also tries to preserve stories through his art. Lama is originally from Humla, Nepal, though his recent exhibition in Kathmandu, titled ‘In Search of Vanishing Identities’, displayed many paintings from Mustang. One of the paintings that he produced at the IMAF captured a nearby apricot tree from the valley surrounding Kagbeni. “Because of globalisation and market demands, people are planting more apples, but before [apricots] were local food for local people,” he says. “I want to spread the message of the importance of our traditional life.”In addition to live, outdoor painting in Kagbeni, the IMAF hosted the Travelling Kathmandu International Mountain Film Festival for four consecutive nights in Jomsom. Festival Director Ramyata Limbu says the KIMFF has travelled to more than 50 districts across Nepal but never to Mustang or another mountain region due to costs and challenging logistics.Limbu, married to Tripple P Gurung, appreciated the screening of films among a gathering of artists. “Artists, filmmakers, dancers, and creative people are all ambassadors for their respective cultures,” she says.On the opening night of screenings in Jomsom, attendees watched three short films. The first film, ‘Dhye Dreams’, focuses on the story of three women in the village of Dhye in Upper Mustang, only three hours north of the film’s screening.“It’s very important to me that the film is shown to the people from this area,” Director Shanta Nepali says. “I want to show people their own experience.” Gurung intends to host a similar event next year and establish the IMAF as an annual tradition in Mustang. “I’m doing this to promote this place, the mountain visit,” he says. “When anything is empty, even in a beautiful place, you can feel it.”Even though the artists who gathered in Mustang came from many different places, they found commonalities between their cultures and communities in their shared passion for art.Emmy Go, who travelled from the island of Papua in East Indonesia for the IMAF, said that Nepal and Mustang were unlike any other place she had been. “It’s a dream country, like a little heaven in the world,” she says.Despite the distance from her home, among a community of artists, Go found similarities between her home country and Nepal. She notes that the ammonite fossils in the Mustang region were the same as her home, and the ladders leading from the courtyard to the roof were constructed the same.Rajbhandari wasn’t surprised by the group’s ability to find commonalities across cultures. “There is a mutual understanding between the artists,” he says.

But other leaders, mainly from opposition parties, have strongly objected to the government’s alleged plans to introduce it. They have publicly criticised the government for what they called plans to ease the criteria for splitting parties in order to help dissident groups in various political parties. These groups have been waiting for an opportune time to form new outfits or defect to bigger ones.As Oli seems determined to bring the ordinance, Congress leaders are either divided or indecisive, according to multiple leaders the Post spoke with.The issue was extensively discussed during the opposition parties’ meeting convened by CPN (Maoist Centre) on Friday. Almost all the leaders in attendance proposed to strongly oppose the government plan. However, Oli looks determined to press ahead with a revision of the Act. He also briefed his party’s top leaders on the issue during a meeting of the party’s central secretariat on Sunday. After Prime Minister Oli also talked about the plan to soon introduce the ordinance, CPN (Unified Socialist) chair Madhav Kumar Nepal warned of consequences on Monday. Addressing a Lumbini Province-level meeting of the Unified Socialist in Kapilvastu on Monday, party chair Nepal warned Prime Minister Oli against bringing such an ordinance. Nepal said Oli will face backlash if he tried to split other parties. “The government will have to face the consequences. Be careful; those who think they can finish others will ultimately finish themselves. World history shows this. Hitler, who dreamed of conquering the world, was alone when he died. Therefore, abandon the Hitler style,” Nepal said while addressing the meeting.“During the brief meeting of the party secretariat, Oli had discussed the ordinances related to political parties,” a UML leader confided to the Post. However, the party's vice chair, Yubraj Gyawali, denied this. The secretariat meeting was focused on the party's internal matters, Gyawali said.“If there were any discussions about the ordinance with the leader of the main coalition partner, we are unaware of it,” Gyawali told the Post. “But during the party’s secretariat meeting, there was no discussion on it.” Soon after the party’s secretariat meeting, Oli met Sher Bahadur Deuba, the president of the Nepali Congress, the senior coalition partner, on Sunday evening. The two leaders also reportedly discussed the ordinance. Congress spokesperson Prakash Saran Mahat also said that the ordinance issue might have come up during the meeting between the two leaders. “However, the Congress is not ready for it,” he said. “If the ordinance related to the political parties is to be brought, it should be done with consensus among the major parties,” Mahat told the Post. “The chances of bringing an ordinance without a broad consensus are low.”Some provisions of the Political Parties Act-2017 that were nullified through an ordinance three years ago have not been revived or replaced, thereby creating a legal void over registering a new outfit by splitting a party.The Act has a provision that defines criteria under which dissidents of a political party can split the organisation and form a new outfit if they can prove the support of a certain number of central committee members and lawmakers of the mother party.Before the introduction of the ordinance in 2021, the Act had a provision that made it mandatory for a dissident group to show support of 40 percent of central committee members and 40 percent of lawmakers from the mother party to split to form a new one.But the Congress-Maoist Centre government led by Deuba issued an ordinance easing the process to split a party. The ordinance said a dissident group having support of 20 percent of central committee members or 20 percent of the party’s lawmakers could quit the mother party and register a new one.The then UML leader Madhav Kumar Nepal split the mother party and formed the CPN (Unified Socialist) based on the same provision of the ordinance. Also, a group led by Mahantha Thakur of Janata Samajbadi Party followed suit.Three years after the party’s formation, a group of leaders from the Unified Socialist are said to be waiting for an opportune time to return to the mother party, the UML. The party’s former secretary Ram Kumari Jhakri, lawmakers Krishna Kumar Shrestha, among others, are reportedly in favour of rejoining the UML, the second-largest party in the House of Representatives. The Nepal-led party has 10 seats in the lower house.Some leaders from the party accused Oli of trying to split their party by helping dissident groups to split the organisation through ordinance. The Unified Socialist has witnessed a serious factional feud following the election of office bearers and politburo members in August. Although the party concluded its general convention on July 5, the election of office bearers and politburo members was conducted later, only to create new rifts. “To cash in on our internal problems, some forces want to split our party.\" Unified Socialist spokesperson Jagannath Khatiwada told the Post. “For that, the government may bring an ordinance related to the political parties.” There are also rumours in the political circles that the UML leadership might also be working to merge into the UML the group of seven lawmakers of the Janata Samajbadi Party, led by Ashok Rai, which was formed in May after splitting with the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal. This will make the UML the largest party in the House of Representatives. The Election Commission gave the Rai-led splinter group recognition as a new party, but the decision has been challenged in the court and the case is sub judice. And the party has been unable to expand its organisation due to the legal question about its recognition. Currently, the Congress is the largest party in the House with 88 seats, while the UML has 78 lawmakers (excluding the Speaker). If the dissidents from the Unified Socialist and Rai-led group join the UML, it may become the largest party surpassing the Congress. “How can Congress allow the government to bring the ordinance to make UML the biggest party in Parliament?” Mahat, the Congress spokesperson, questioned. “There are indeed discussions on the ordinance, but it is not necessarily that these discussions yield concrete results.” The Political Party (Second Amendment) Bill was sent to the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee in February. After discussion in the committee, the bill was forwarded to the House for the endorsement. However, the then deputy prime minister and home minister Rabi Lamichhane withdrew the bill from the House, said the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee chair, Ram Hari Khatiwada.Khatiwada, a Congress lawmaker, also thinks the ordinance is unlikely to be introduced. Khatiwada said Prime Minister Oli might have discussed ordinance-related issues with Congress President Deuba, and the UML might have also held internal discussions at its secretariat meeting on Sunday. “But it is unimaginable to think a coalition formed for political stability will create chaos by introducing the ordinance and splitting political parties,” Khatiwada told the Post. “Further, if the ordinance is brought, it should be tabled by the Minister of Law, and I don’t think the minister wants to do so.” Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, Ajay Chaurasiya, also denied the possibility of bringing such an ordinance. “If the ordinance is to be introduced, the ministry I am leading should take the agenda to the Cabinet,” Chaurasiya told the Post. “No one till date has suggested that such an ordinance be brought.” The regular Cabinet meeting on Monday was expected to discuss the ordinance related to the political parties. However, the meeting was cancelled at the last minute.Meanwhile, leaders of five opposition parties, while submitting a memorandum to the prime minister on Monday evening, have warned Oli “not to issue any ordinance with a plan to split other parties” with the goal of “imposing a totalitarian two-party system”.Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Unified Socialist chair Nepal, Rastriya Prajatantra Party chair Rajendra Lingden, vice-chair Dol Prasad Aryal of Rastriya Swatantra Party, and Aam Janata Party chief Prabhu Sah submitted the 13-point memorandum. The prime minister had tried to allay their concerns by assuring them that he had no plans to introduce such an ordinance, according to Lingden.

However, evidence suggests he may have been involved.","summary":"After the Nepal Police arrested Rabi Lamichhane, the president of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and the former deputy prime minister, on Friday for his alleged involvement in the misuse of cooperative funds, people are now asking what will happen to Nepali Congress Vice President Dhanaraj Gurung and CPN-UML lawmaker Rishikesh Pokharel, who are also accused in similar offences.Supporters of Lamichhane took to the streets in Kathmandu and Pokhara, calling for the arrest of Gurung and Pokharel. They held placards with the names of Lamichhane, Gurung and Pokharel, questioning whether the ruling party lawmakers would also be arrested. Lamichhane is currently in the custody of the District Police Office, Kaski after a complaint was lodged against him for allegedly misusing funds from the Suryadarshan Cooperative in Pokhara. He is also being investigated for organised crime.However, the Department of Cooperatives has said no complaints have been filed regarding the alleged misuse of cooperative funds by Gurung and Pokharel. “Our department has not received any complaints against the cooperatives involving Gurung and Pokharel,” Tol Raj Upadhyaya, the spokesperson of the Department of Cooperatives, told the Post. “Complaints related to cooperatives are reported at the provincial or local level as well, so if there are complaints against them, they may have been filed there.” The information officer of the Ministry of Industry, Agriculture, and Cooperative of Koshi Province, Lila Ballav Chapagain, said no complaints have been registered against Pokharel and his wife, Anjala Koirala, at the provincial level. Chapagain also said that the cooperative organisation concerned is currently not functional.UML leader Pokharel, who chairs the Federal Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, has also been accused of embezzling cooperative funds. His wife, Anjala, previously served on the board of Umagauri Agricultural Cooperative as a director. She is accused of embezzling Rs140 million from the organisation located at Karsiya Baza in ward 4 of Dhanpal Nath Rural Municipality in Morang. The cooperative is now defunct.Pokharel has been denying any wrongdoing by himself or his wife. “My wife was merely a witness when some other people from the cooperative took out loans, but this fact has been distorted to cover up the wrongdoings of others,” Pokharel claimed.“I will defend myself when the new session of the Parliament starts. However, I am also open to an investigation if the state agency wants.” Pokharel said that he, as the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, raised concerns about corruption in various sectors and claimed that those under investigation have orchestrated a false narrative against him and his wife. He claimed that the CPN (Maoist Centre) was orchestrating the schemes against him and his wife. Pokharel’s claim holds some water, as he was targeted by the CPN (Maoist Centre) amid escalating tensions within the government. In July, the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) cut off power to six industrial firms that failed to pay the tariff for using a specialised feeder and trunk line for electricity. For days, despite a written order from the Electricity Regulatory Commission and the verbal instructions from Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, NEA chief Kulman Ghising refused to restore power to the six firms. After a conflict arose between NEA chief Ghising and Prime Minister Oli, the Public Accounts Committee, headed by Pokharel, raised the issue of corruption at the NEA. In response, leaders of the Maoist Centre leaders brought up allegations of cooperative fraud, suggesting that Pokharel was attempting to deflect attention away from him.However, Maoist Centre chief whip Hitraj Pandey says that Pokharel and his wife's involvement in cooperative fraud did not come out of nowhere in the media.“But we fear that as the current government intends to take action against those not in its favour, it might protect those close to it,” Pandey told the Post. “Regarding Pokharel and his wife’s involvement in the cooperative fraud case, the parliamentary special probe committee, which submitted its report last month, also mentions them.”However, the report does not explicitly name Pokharel and his wife. “Since there were no complaints against them, our committee did not investigate Pokharel and his wife,” UML lawmaker Sarita Bhusal, who served as a member of the parliamentary special probe committee on cooperatives scam, told the Post.With no complaint lodged against UML lawmaker Pokharel and his wife, the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police has began investigating the alleged fraud involving the Miteri Savings and Credit Cooperative, which is connected to Congress Vice President Dhan Raj Gurung and his former wife, Jyoti Gurung. CIB spokesperson Hobindra Bogati said they are thoroughly reviewing the complaint against the Miteri Cooperatives. “We are investigating the complaint against Miteri Cooperative, where Dhanraj Gurung and his former wife are allegedly involved,” Bogati told the Post.After the cooperative’s chairman, Kumbharaj Gurung, filed a complaint with the Department of Cooperatives in August, alleging that Jyoti Gurung, the general manager, embezzled Rs12.5 million, Congress Vice-President Gurung also came under scrutiny. Jyoti Gurung is Dhanaraj Gurung's former wife.Gurung has denied his involvement in the scam, arguing that his former wife, with whom he no longer has a relationship, misappropriated the money, so he cannot be held accountable. Despite Gurung’s claim that he separated from his wife in 2019, Miteri Cooperative chair Kumbharaj reported he had registered a complaint against the Gurung duo and informed law enforcement agencies that the lawmaker continued to pay off the debts in his wife’s name until last year. Various copies of the vouchers Dhan Raj Gurung reportedly used to deposit money into the cooperative’s account have surfaced in various media outlets.After being charged with embezzling the cooperative's funds, Dhan Raj Gurung, speaking in Parliament on September 10, called for a proper investigation to clear his name. A parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate the crisis-ridden cooperatives submitted its report last month. The committee also recommended investigating Gurung and his former wife for misusing the cooperative’s funds.  "},{"hash":"3bfcd396aa210715d74e5ff3a437534af064c40e8a516609c03fce9e235de375","title":"swatantra-party-chief-lamichhane-remanded-to-six-days-in-custody","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/10/21/swatantra-party-chief-lamichhane-remanded-to-six-days-in-custody","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/Untitled13-1729480945.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1729468800000,"source":"kp","category":"politics","content":"The Kaski District Court on Sunday remanded Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane in custody for six days for further investigation on charges of cooperatives funds embezzlement and organised crime.According to Suraj Adhikari, the information officer at the district court, the single bench of district judge Nabaraj Dahal granted the District Police Office in Kaski the permission to keep Lamichhane in custody for six days effective from Friday, when a team of the Central Investigation Bureau detained the RSP chief from his party office in Kathmandu.District attorney Kamala Kafle, assistant district attorney duo Shanti Devi Sharma and Bipin Raj Tiwari and advocate Bed Bahadur Bista argued in court seeking the six-day remand order. Senior advocates Sushil Panta and Narayan Ghimire argued on behalf of Lamichhane.Lamichhane was arrested in Kathmandu on Friday and was subsequently brought to Pokhara, where he was presented before the court on Sunday. Lamichhane, along with several other individuals, is accused of misappropriating funds from the Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Savings and Credit Cooperative. The arrest followed a parliamentary probe which linked him and others to the embezzlement of millions of rupees from the cooperative.The court on Friday had issued arrest warrants against 14 individuals, with investigations being conducted into their involvement. So far, over 60 people have been implicated in misusing the deposits of Suryadarshan Cooperative, with six, including Gorkha Media Network’s director and former DIG of Nepal Police, Chhabilal Joshi, held in custody for investigation.RSP activists hit the streetsProtests were staged both in favour of and against Lamichhane in Pokhara, with RSP supporters rallying for his release and cooperative victims demanding his detention for further investigation into the fraud allegations. The police remained on high alert to prevent possible clashes and any untoward incident as parallel demonstrations continued.RSP members and supporters staged protests at Sahid Chowk, demanding Lamichhane’s unconditional release. Terming Lamichhane’s arrest a political vendetta, the protesters claimed that the government was protecting the leaders of the ruling parties who are “actually involved” in the cooperative scam.The protesters clashed with police as the security personnel tried to remove the demonstrators from Sahid Chowk which had earlier been declared a prohibited area.The police personnel and the demonstrators shoved one another for some time. The police lobbed a teargas canister and used a water cannon to disperse the protesters for some time.The protesters accused the government of using excessive force to suppress their peaceful agitation. “The government used force to suppress the protest. Today, it used canes and water cannon against us. Tomorrow, it could use bullets,” said Manish Jha, the RSP spokesperson. RSP cadres and supporters had gathered at Sahid Chowk, which is around 100 metres from the district court, before the administration declared it as a prohibited area.All senior RSP leaders and lawmakers including DP Aryal, Swarnim Wagle, Shishir Khanal, Manish Jha, Chanda Karki, Toshima Karki, Sumana Shrestha, Hari Dhakal, and Nisha Dangi participated in the protest rally. They chanted slogans against the government. The RSP activists and supporters staged demonstrations in Pokhara on Saturday as well. They chanted slogans against Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. Stating that the government is hell-bent on protecting its tainted leaders, the activists marched with photos of Nepali Congress Vice President Dhanraj Gurung and CPN-UML leader Rishikesh Pokharel. Gurung along with his ex-wife are also accused of misusing cooperative funds, while Pokharel, who chairs the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, along with his wife, is facing similar charges.Prohibitory order imposed around district administration officeTo prevent possible clashes and unrest, the Kaski District Administration Office on Sunday issued a prohibitory order in certain areas of Pokhara. Chief District Officer Bharat Mani Pandey issued the order, which bans protests, rallies, and gatherings in Sahid Chowk and Palikhe Chowk areas.The order came into effect from 11:45 am on Sunday and will remain in place until further notice, the district administration said.The order restricts gatherings of more than five people and prohibits protests, sit-ins, demonstrations, and public assemblies. Anyone violating the order will face legal action as per existing laws, the administration said.The restrictions were imposed after protests erupted following Lamichhane’s arrest on Friday evening. Demonstrations have continued in Pokhara since Saturday, with RSP leaders and supporters protesting the detention. Additionally, victims of cooperative scams are also protesting near Rastrabank Chowk, raising concerns of possible clashes between the two groups. There is a heavy deployment of police in and around the protest sites.Victims of cooperative scam take to the streetPeople defrauded by various savings cooperatives also staged demonstrations at Mustang Chowk in Pokhara demanding action against those involved in embezzling public deposits. They had initially planned demonstrations at Rastrabank Chowk but later shifted the protest venue after the district administration imposed a prohibitory order in various places, including Rastrabank Chowk.The depositors united under the banner of the Cooperative Depositors Victims Struggle Committee and Surya Darshan Depositors Victims Struggle Committee staged the demonstrations. They demanded immediate return of the money misused by the Gorkha Media Network and a fair probe into the involvement of board members of Gorkha Media Network for their alleged involvement in cooperative fraud.Even elderly people and women carrying babies participated in the demonstration. Asha KC of Bindhyabasini in Pokhara attended the demonstration with her four-year-old son on her back. According to her, she had deposited Rs6.4 million in Suryadarshan Savings and Cooperative after selling her house.“We heard that Rabi and GB took the money we had deposited. We don't care who took it, we want our money back,” said KC. ","summary":"The Kaski District Court on Sunday remanded Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane in custody for six days for further investigation on charges of cooperatives funds embezzlement and organised crime.According to Suraj Adhikari, the information officer at the district court, the single bench of district judge Nabaraj Dahal granted the District Police Office in Kaski the permission to keep Lamichhane in custody for six days effective from Friday, when a team of the Central Investigation Bureau detained the RSP chief from his party office in Kathmandu.District attorney Kamala Kafle, assistant district attorney duo Shanti Devi Sharma and Bipin Raj Tiwari and advocate Bed Bahadur Bista argued in court seeking the six-day remand order. Senior advocates Sushil Panta and Narayan Ghimire argued on behalf of Lamichhane.Lamichhane was arrested in Kathmandu on Friday and was subsequently brought to Pokhara, where he was presented before the court on Sunday. Lamichhane, along with several other individuals, is accused of misappropriating funds from the Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Savings and Credit Cooperative. The arrest followed a parliamentary probe which linked him and others to the embezzlement of millions of rupees from the cooperative.The court on Friday had issued arrest warrants against 14 individuals, with investigations being conducted into their involvement. So far, over 60 people have been implicated in misusing the deposits of Suryadarshan Cooperative, with six, including Gorkha Media Network’s director and former DIG of Nepal Police, Chhabilal Joshi, held in custody for investigation.RSP activists hit the streetsProtests were staged both in favour of and against Lamichhane in Pokhara, with RSP supporters rallying for his release and cooperative victims demanding his detention for further investigation into the fraud allegations. The police remained on high alert to prevent possible clashes and any untoward incident as parallel demonstrations continued.RSP members and supporters staged protests at Sahid Chowk, demanding Lamichhane’s unconditional release. Terming Lamichhane’s arrest a political vendetta, the protesters claimed that the government was protecting the leaders of the ruling parties who are “actually involved” in the cooperative scam.The protesters clashed with police as the security personnel tried to remove the demonstrators from Sahid Chowk which had earlier been declared a prohibited area.The police personnel and the demonstrators shoved one another for some time. The police lobbed a teargas canister and used a water cannon to disperse the protesters for some time.The protesters accused the government of using excessive force to suppress their peaceful agitation. “The government used force to suppress the protest. Today, it used canes and water cannon against us. Tomorrow, it could use bullets,” said Manish Jha, the RSP spokesperson. RSP cadres and supporters had gathered at Sahid Chowk, which is around 100 metres from the district court, before the administration declared it as a prohibited area.All senior RSP leaders and lawmakers including DP Aryal, Swarnim Wagle, Shishir Khanal, Manish Jha, Chanda Karki, Toshima Karki, Sumana Shrestha, Hari Dhakal, and Nisha Dangi participated in the protest rally. They chanted slogans against the government. The RSP activists and supporters staged demonstrations in Pokhara on Saturday as well. They chanted slogans against Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. Stating that the government is hell-bent on protecting its tainted leaders, the activists marched with photos of Nepali Congress Vice President Dhanraj Gurung and CPN-UML leader Rishikesh Pokharel. Gurung along with his ex-wife are also accused of misusing cooperative funds, while Pokharel, who chairs the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, along with his wife, is facing similar charges.Prohibitory order imposed around district administration officeTo prevent possible clashes and unrest, the Kaski District Administration Office on Sunday issued a prohibitory order in certain areas of Pokhara. Chief District Officer Bharat Mani Pandey issued the order, which bans protests, rallies, and gatherings in Sahid Chowk and Palikhe Chowk areas.The order came into effect from 11:45 am on Sunday and will remain in place until further notice, the district administration said.The order restricts gatherings of more than five people and prohibits protests, sit-ins, demonstrations, and public assemblies. Anyone violating the order will face legal action as per existing laws, the administration said.The restrictions were imposed after protests erupted following Lamichhane’s arrest on Friday evening. Demonstrations have continued in Pokhara since Saturday, with RSP leaders and supporters protesting the detention.

A team of Nepal Police’s Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) arrested Lamichhane from the RSP’s headquarters in Banasthali, Kathmandu on Friday evening.Lamichhane was apprehended to investigate his alleged involvement in cooperative fraud and organised crime. He was subsequently taken by road to the District Police Office in Kaski.A seven-member parliamentary special committee formed in May to investigate the cooperatives scam recommended legal actions against Lamichhane and three other individuals for their involvement in cooperative frauds. He faces allegations of misappropriating funds from a cooperative while serving as the managing director of the Gorkha Media Network that ran now-defunct Galaxy 4k Television before joining politics in June 2022.While leaders of ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML have remained silent on his arrest, there has been a mixed reaction among other party leaders.Speaking with the Post, Nepali Congress spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat said that the investigation agencies arrested Lamichhane as per the finding and recommendation of the parliamentary probe committee.“The report is public now and it was signed by a member of the RSP too,” Mahat said. “Besides the report of the parliamentary committee, the investigating agencies might have collected additional evidence and that must have created a ground for the police to arrest Lamichhane.”Meanwhile, Surya Thapa, who led the parliamentary special committee to probe the crisis-ridden cooperatives, has criticised the RSP leadership for their reaction after Lamichhane’s arrest. RSP leaders have said that Lamichhane’s arrest was motivated by political vendetta. Likening their reaction to ‘an artless drama’, Thapa writes on Facebook, “After the ‘Clean Chit ra Safaai film’ flopped everywhere within a few days, a new artless drama is being staged—‘Vendetta!’”Thapa had earlier come down heavily on Lamichhane and other RSP leaders when they claimed that the committee’s probe could not establish his involvement in cooperative scams.After the Thapa-led committee submitted its report, Lamichhane and RSP leaders had claimed that the parliamentary committee had given a clean chit to him and his involvement in cooperatives fraud could not be established. But Thapa kept on challenging the claim.In the wake of Lamichhane’s arrest, RSP cadres staged protests in Kathmandu, Pokhara and other parts of the country on Saturday. Addressing the protests, the RSP leaders attacked the leadership of the present government. Some RSP leaders like vice-president Swarnim Wagle and acting spokesperson Manish Jha, among others, condemned Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, and Foreign Minister Arzu Rana, among others.Meanwhile, Deputy General Secretary of CPN (Maoist Centre) and former minister Barsha Man Pun has demanded the arrest of Nepali Congress vice-president Dhanraj Gurung and UML lawmaker Rishikesh Pokhrel, who is also the chair of Public Accounts Committee of the House of Representatives, two leaders who are also alleged to be involved in the cooperatives scam.Speaking with reporters in Rolpa, Pun said that Gurung and Pokhrel should not be exempted and there should not be double standards in arresting the alleged in the cooperatives scam. “Whatever is happening with Rabi Lamichhane should also happen with Gurung and Rishikesh,” Pun said, according to a statement issued by his private secretariat.Mahat, the Nepali Congress spokesperson, said that they are always open for any kind of investigation on Gurung. “Our party has never blocked any kind of investigation against him,” he said.Former Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai, who is also the chairman of Nepal Samajbadi Party, said that Lamichanne should cooperate in the police investigation but he has full sympathy for him.He said Lamichhane has to go through the investigation process even if there is no truth in the accusation he has faced. “I have my full sympathy for him as he himself has said that he would help in the investigation process,” Bhattarai said. “I think he has to help duly end the investigation process.” The former prime minister stated that because there is rule of law in a democracy, whoever is found guilty, big or small, should be punished.The Kaski district police will produce Lamichanne in court on Sunday.

Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways.

Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” ","summary":"The rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance.

If yes, it would have insured all the structures it has built.And when those infrastructures got damaged, for instance in floods and landslides, insurance would cover their rebuilding, said Surya Prasad Silwal, chairman of Nepal Insurance Authority, speaking at the press meeting following the 20th International Conference on Inclusive Insurance, organised in Kathmandu on Tuesday.Experts say that insurance absorbs the shock of a loss and reduces dependence on loan sharks, external aids, or relief from donor agencies.They said Nepal needs micro insurance to bring the people out of poverty and for sustainable economic development.“In a country like Nepal, there is a need for microinsurance as more than 20 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, and they need protection,” said Silwal.Insuring poor people can save them from getting poorer.Silwal said the insurance claim in the aftermath of the September-end disaster, which claimed hundreds of lives and damaged properties worth billions, was insufficient.The five-day conference commenced on Monday, bringing together 500 national and foreign participants, such as experts from non-government organisations, development organisations, regulatory bodies, policy experts, and the insurance industry.As the impact of climate change has started to become visible in the Himalayas, with glacial outbursts damaging lives, property, and agricultural land, insurance can be an important tool to protect against damage, said Silwal. The most vulnerable groups need to be insured, and they need insurance support from the government and insurance companies.According to insurance companies, hardly 10 percent of the Nepali population is insured. In recent flooding and landslides, nearly 250 people died, but not even 10 percent came to claim insurance. “So inclusive insurance is important, and more awareness is needed for it,” said Silwal.The conference will host various discussions and plenary sessions, including agendas on climate risk insurance, digital innovations in microinsurance, and strategies to overcome barriers to scaling inclusive insurance.Experts from more than 50 countries will discuss and identify ways of accelerating growth and economic viability in inclusive insurance for emerging markets, the organiser said.The Nepal Insurance Association, Life Insurance Association Nepal, Nepal Microinsurance Association and the Nepal Insurance Authority hosted the conference in cooperation with the Munich Re Foundation and the Microinsurance Network.“Empowering over 2 billion people in South Asia with accessible insurance is not just a goal; it's a necessity,” said Dirk Reinhard, vice-chairman of Munich Re Foundation.“Now, of the 2 billion people in Asia, we may reach 10 percent, maybe more, but not a lot,” he said. “Of those with some sort of insurance, only a few have access to truly reliable and affordable safety nets that really cover all major risks.”Asia is the largest market for migrant insurance and inclusive insurance. Nepal is perfectly located next to the migrant markets of India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, with a strong interest from Bhutan. Reinhard said about 50 percent of the participants and over 25 percent of the speakers are from those countries. “I'm very proud to see Nepal bringing participants from countries together despite political challenges.”“We, as insurance experts, development experts, government representatives and regulators, and many stakeholders, have an important role to play in the fight against poverty and in achieving sustainable economic development. And we are part of the solution,” said Reinhard.“We want to promote the development and proliferation of good value insurance in emerging countries, raise awareness of the demand for insurance in local income segments and its potential, and provide opportunities for insurers, insurance and government experts to create new partnerships,” said Reinhard.Heat waves, flooding, droughts, wildfires, and rapidly intensifying tropical cyclones caused havoc, affected life for millions of people and inflicted billions of dollars in economic losses. “Though one might view extremes in weather and climate as the root cause or simply as a contributory factor, the resulting damage and displacement in vulnerable populations is a real and major concern for all of us,” said Lorenzo Chan, chair of the Microinsurance Network's Board of Directors.“The impact of these and other man-made challenges undermines resilience and creates protection risks in the vulnerable populations we seek to serve and include,” said Chan.Risk management is necessary, especially for those at the lower end of the pyramid, to continue sustainable growth and economic development, said Chan. The role of insurance in mitigating risks and enabling individuals and families to rebuild their homes, restore their businesses, and resume their lives after a calamity, death, or illness cannot be underestimated, he said.

Speaking at the closing ceremony, Ambassador of the European Union to Nepal, Véronique Lorenzo, said the TIP has been instrumental in enhancing Nepal’s trade and investment capacities and reiterated the EU’s commitment to continue supporting Nepal’s graduation to a middle-income country.“Our cooperation wishes to strengthen Nepal in the multilateral trade system,” Ambassador Lorenzo said. “However, we must be aware that the graduation may affect Nepal’s trade, particularly exports to European and other markets.”This is because the EU’s Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme will not be available for duty-free exports to Europe after the three-year transition period following its graduation in 2026. The Ambassador also stressed the need for creating employment in Nepal, and said she wished to see more Nepali products in European shops. Lorenzo added that the EU offers Nepal access to the Generalised Scheme of Preference Plus (GSP+). For trading under GSP+ Nepal would need to make an application and ratify the required international conventions on human rights, labour rights, environmental protection, climate change and good governance. Most importantly, the conventions will need to be implemented.The Ambassador also spoke about some achievements of TIP.Under the trade component, TIP supported the development of a National Pashmina Sector Export Strategy, the establishment of a Pashmina Fibre Processing Centre, and the training of over 2,500 coffee and pashmina producers and exporters. For sustainable graduation from LDC status, TIP supported enhancements in trade negotiation skills for government officials and collaborated with private sector associations and other civil society organizations to review the policy framework with a gender lens. It also facilitated public-private dialogues and developed recommendations for gender-friendly policies.Similarly, the investment component was instrumental in supporting Nepal’s efforts to improve the investment climate and attract foreign direct investment (FDI). “We identified green projects for all four sectors of priority— IT, agriculture, tourism, and renewable energy,” said Claudius Preville, team leader of TIP.“One of the important work that we have done is the use of technology in modernising the trade infrastructure in Nepal. In that connection we did two major interventions—development of an FDI toolkit and development of an FDI automatic route,” said Preville.“These two applications together have proven to be very effective in the country.”TIP has three objectives: increased trade and participation in regional and global value-chains, improved investment climate for attracting FDI and improved trade and investment.TIP supported the drafting of and consultations on six policies and strategies aimed at addressing different bottlenecks faced while investing in Nepal, including Nepal Trade Integration Strategy (NTIS 2023).“NTIS 2023 was a huge project for us and it has already been more than 10 months of implementation. We resourced more than 200,000 euros for the project,” said Perville.TIP supported consultation on the Micro, Cottage and Small Industry Promotion Policy 2023 and National Start-up Enterprise Policy 2024.“The project has significantly increased the percentage of women engaged in events involving investment and trade,” Perville said.“We have also seen a significant uptick in FDI through the automated route. A total of 139 companies were registered through the automated FDI process in the last few months, he said.In terms of improvement of FDI in Nepal, Preville said that there is a need to reform the business visa regime as EU countries found this to be very problematic. There is a need to address the issue of profit repatriation for foreign investors and work-related earnings, he addedAccording to TIP, EU imports from Nepal grew by 87 percent to 101 million euro since the project inception in 2020.Coffee exports surged by 89 percent since the project started, reaching Rs150 million in the fiscal year 2023-24. Coffee production increased by 33 percent since project inception, reaching 395 tonnes in the last fiscal year.The export of knitted pashmina products grew 75 percent since the project inception, reaching Rs3.1 billion in 2023-24.“Nepal has untapped export potential of $9.2 billion than of current $1.2 billion,” said Preville.

However, they say that most of the health facilities that provide burn care only provide minor treatment which does not ensure patient safety. Due to the lack of dedicated centres and specialised care at the health facilities, most patients are brought to Kirtipur Hospital in Kathmandu, which offers expert care.“Decision to provide free care to burn victims is a very positive thing,” said Dr Shankar Man Rai, a senior consultant at the Department of Burns at Kirtipur Hospital. “Authorities concerned should also think about providing advance care, which could ensure patient’s safety.”Nepal is among the countries with the highest incidence of burn injuries. It is the second most common injury in rural Nepal, accounting for 5 percent of disabilities, according to the World Health Organisation.The Ministry of Health and Population estimates that each year, 55,000 people throughout the country suffer burn injuries.A study carried out in the past shows that over 40,000 people suffer from burns [minor or severe] every year in Nepal. Among them, about 1,500 to 2000 die because of them.The Kirtipur Hospital alone provides treatment to around 800 victims each year.The number of patients with burn injuries rises during the winter, as people make bonfires to stay warm. Elderly women and under-age children are more vulnerable to fire incidents, as they remain in the house or near fires most of the time. They have a weaker immune system compared to adults and that makes the recovery process even more complicated, according to doctors.The country, however, is miserably ill-equipped to treat burn patients. The government has neither upgraded or increased facilities nor run any awareness programmes to deal with the situation in the immediate aftermath of a burn incident.Experts say providing minor care does not ensure patient safety, and a multidisciplinary team of experts is needed to provide specialised care to victims. For that, highly trained medical professionals with years of training, advanced equipment and advanced facilities are needed, which requires a huge investment. They say a huge investment in many hospitals at once is impossible.“We have been working to make the Kirtipur Hospital a specialised facility in the country for around a decade,” Rai said. “We at least need one such centre that provides advanced treatment. If the government also offered financial help, it would be easier for us to bring such a centre into operation as soon as possible.”Doctors say awareness alone can substantially increase the chances of survival of burn patients. ","summary":"Impoverished burn victims and their families need not worry about costly medical expenses now as the government has decided to cover all treatment costs for those who cannot afford it.A meeting of the Council of Ministers held on Friday took the decision to this effect.As per the decision, along with Kirtipur Hospital, state-run health facilities Bir Hospital of Bagmati Province, BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences of Koshi Province, Narayani Hospital in Madhesh Province and Pokhara Institute of Health Sciences of Gandaki Province will provide free care to burn victims who cannot afford to pay medical bills.Likewise, the government will reimburse the treatment cost of poor burn victims at Bheri Hospital of Lumbini Province, Surkhet Provincial Hospital of Karnali Province and Seti Provincial Hospital of Sudurpaschim Province.Experts have welcomed the government’s decision. However, they say that most of the health facilities that provide burn care only provide minor treatment which does not ensure patient safety. Due to the lack of dedicated centres and specialised care at the health facilities, most patients are brought to Kirtipur Hospital in Kathmandu, which offers expert care.“Decision to provide free care to burn victims is a very positive thing,” said Dr Shankar Man Rai, a senior consultant at the Department of Burns at Kirtipur Hospital. “Authorities concerned should also think about providing advance care, which could ensure patient’s safety.”Nepal is among the countries with the highest incidence of burn injuries. It is the second most common injury in rural Nepal, accounting for 5 percent of disabilities, according to the World Health Organisation.The Ministry of Health and Population estimates that each year, 55,000 people throughout the country suffer burn injuries.A study carried out in the past shows that over 40,000 people suffer from burns [minor or severe] every year in Nepal. Among them, about 1,500 to 2000 die because of them.The Kirtipur Hospital alone provides treatment to around 800 victims each year.The number of patients with burn injuries rises during the winter, as people make bonfires to stay warm. Elderly women and under-age children are more vulnerable to fire incidents, as they remain in the house or near fires most of the time. They have a weaker immune system compared to adults and that makes the recovery process even more complicated, according to doctors.The country, however, is miserably ill-equipped to treat burn patients.

The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.Of late, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley have reported an upsurge in the number of dengue infection rates.At least nine deaths and over 20,000 infections have been reported from all 77 districts across the country. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms.With a recent surge in the infection rates, the number of pregnant women contracting this deadly virus is also rising alarmingly. Maternal health experts are particularly concerned as viral infections during pregnancy can lead to severe complications that increase the risk of maternal and newborn deaths.“Although we have not yet recorded any maternal and newborn deaths due to dengue infection, we have seen several cases of premature births and low birth weight,” said Adhikari. “Due to low platelet counts, we have transfused blood to several patients.”Maternal health experts say that due to weakened immunity, the chances of pregnant women getting severe increase manifold, and the risk of mortality rate also increases. Compared to normal people, pregnant women are at high risk of getting severe dengue infections, according to them.“Pregnant women could have a prepartum haemorrhage, which can lead to preterm delivery,” said Dr Sunil Sharma Acharya, a physician at the maternity hospital, Thapathali. “Effects on the liver could be exacerbated by dengue. Dengue infection during pregnancy also increases the risk of miscarriage.”Experts say that high-grade fever and medicine used for the treatment of fever could lead to preterm labour, contractions and preterm birth. Excessive bleeding during delivery or within 24 hours after childbirth transmission of infection to newborn babies also increases the risk of maternal and newborn deaths.Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 239 per 100,000 births in 2016 to 151 per 100,000 in 2021, according to the national census carried out by the National Statistics Office. Earlier, the country had reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award. The health target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030.The rise in dengue infection rate, from which pregnant women are also getting infected, alarmed the experts. They warned that the rise in dengue infection rate could increase maternal mortality. They asked pregnant women to consult doctors if they got infected with the dengue virus and cautioned them not to take over-the-counter drugs. The post-monsoon period is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease since the beginning of the year and across the pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons.“Hundreds of people in the Kathmandu Valley might have been infected with dengue virus in recent days,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Shukraraj Hospital. “As the post-monsoon period is the peak dengue season, neither the general public nor the authorities have taken the issue seriously, and the rise in infection rate was obvious.”As there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms, including platelet-rich plasma transfusion.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives.

According to Basaula, the number of patients with severe stomach pain, vomiting, and bleeding from nose, gums, and stool is increasing.“We transfuse platelets to the patients whose platelets count is too low,” said Basaula. “We advise those suffering from severe dengue not to wait at home for too long and to seek hospital care as soon as possible.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes.

We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. ","summary":"I can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide.

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream?

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  ","summary":"The noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built.

But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. ","summary":"“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words.

Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley ","summary":"Mundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution.

They had beaten Afghanistan 13-0 and Pakistan 12-0 during the group stage of the inaugural SAFF Women’s Championship in 2010 in Bangladesh. India hold the record for the biggest win of the competition, having defeated Bhutan with a scoreline of 18-0, also in the 2010 edition.The win against the Maldives is also a clear message that coach Rajendra Tamang’s team, who were held to a 0-0 draw by Bhutan in their opening match, are still favoured to win their maiden trophy after reaching final in five of the six previous editions.Coach Tamang made five changes in the squad that played a goalless stalemate against Bhutan, resting captain and goalkeeper Anjila Tumbapo Subba and star forward Sabitra Bhandari, who arrived in Kathmandu from France on Monday morning. Second choice goalkeeper Anjana Rana Magar, Rekha Paudel, Bimala BK, Bimala Chaudhary and Nisha Thokar started against the Maldives.Hira Bhujel and Dipa Shahi, who were stretchered off during the Bhutan clash due to injuries, are set to miss the rest of the SAFF championship.Nepal women were under a huge pressure after going winless against Bhutan for the first time in their SAFF history.The presence of Bhandari was also badly missed and there were doubts whether Nepal could deliver against the Maldives.But Paudel did not let the absence of Bhandari gloom the crowd again.Nepal were totally dominant from the start, pushing the Maldives to a frantic defending from early on.The pressure immediately paid off as Rai started the goal rush when her low shot from the left astonishingly beat two defenders before squeezing past Maldives goalkeeper Aminath Leeza in the 5th minute.The early setback woke up Leeza and the goalkeeper put all her effort to deny Paudel twice and Rashmi Ghising once to keep Nepal from scoring further.But Sabita Rana Magar undid Leeza in the 29th minute with a well-measured left-footed long ranger, which suddenly opened the floodgates. Paudel smelled blood and scored twice before the break—first flicking a cross from Ghising in the 32nd minute and then tapping in a pass from Sabita in the 42nd minute. The goal fest continued after the break as well. Paudel then completed her hat-trick three minutes into the restart smashing the roof of the net from close range after Aminath Zaahiya failed to clear her first attempt from a tight angle.Paudel got her fourth in the 63rd minute after Saru Limbu, who also engineered Nepal’s fifth goal earlier, put her through with a clever pass.Rai scored a screamer in the 65th for her individual second, arrowing from the edge of the box after Paudel cut back for her.Anita KC got Nepal’s eighth in the 69th seconds after coming off the bench after running into substitute Anita Basnet’s pass that collected a bit of luck off a deflection from Hawwa Haneefa. Paudel got her fifth goal of the game in the 78th after KC set her up.Rai scored her hat-trick in the 87th through a penalty after MSB Ahmed Ali handled the ball inside the area, and substitute Karki wrapped up a big victory a minute later converting a pass from Sabita.Nepal had a total of 35 shots at attempt—22 of them were on target—to the Maldives’ none.“Our first match was unexpected. The coach told us to play an attacking game and try to score more. Our objective was clear and I am happy that I was able to score,” player of the match Paudel said during the presentation. “It was a team effort. Thanks to my teammates,” she added.Nepal climbed to the top in the Group B standing on goal difference despite being level on four points with Bhutan, who thumped Sri Lanka 4-1 earlier on the day.Nepal take on Sri Lanka in their final group game on Thursday. Sri Lanka have three points and lie in the third position.The Maldives crashed out after two straight losses and will play for pride against Bhutan on Thursday.Tournament’s most successful side and five-time champions India and defending champions Bangladesh, who beat Nepal in the 2022 final to break India’s iron grip on SAFF throne last edition, are in Group B. India, who beat Pakistan 5-2 in their opening match, have already progressed into the last four. Bangladesh have one point after a damaging draw against Pakistan and face off against India in their last group game on Wednesday. ","summary":"Rekha Paudel scored five goals and Preeti Rai netted a hat-trick as Nepal demolished the Maldives 11-0 in a total domination in their second Group B match of the SAFF Women’s Championship at the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu on Monday.Sabita Rana Magar, Anita KC and Amisha Karki were also on target for Nepal.The victory margin is Nepal’s third biggest win in the SAFF Women’s competition, and fourth overall. They had beaten Afghanistan 13-0 and Pakistan 12-0 during the group stage of the inaugural SAFF Women’s Championship in 2010 in Bangladesh. India hold the record for the biggest win of the competition, having defeated Bhutan with a scoreline of 18-0, also in the 2010 edition.The win against the Maldives is also a clear message that coach Rajendra Tamang’s team, who were held to a 0-0 draw by Bhutan in their opening match, are still favoured to win their maiden trophy after reaching final in five of the six previous editions.Coach Tamang made five changes in the squad that played a goalless stalemate against Bhutan, resting captain and goalkeeper Anjila Tumbapo Subba and star forward Sabitra Bhandari, who arrived in Kathmandu from France on Monday morning. Second choice goalkeeper Anjana Rana Magar, Rekha Paudel, Bimala BK, Bimala Chaudhary and Nisha Thokar started against the Maldives.Hira Bhujel and Dipa Shahi, who were stretchered off during the Bhutan clash due to injuries, are set to miss the rest of the SAFF championship.Nepal women were under a huge pressure after going winless against Bhutan for the first time in their SAFF history.The presence of Bhandari was also badly missed and there were doubts whether Nepal could deliver against the Maldives.But Paudel did not let the absence of Bhandari gloom the crowd again.Nepal were totally dominant from the start, pushing the Maldives to a frantic defending from early on.The pressure immediately paid off as Rai started the goal rush when her low shot from the left astonishingly beat two defenders before squeezing past Maldives goalkeeper Aminath Leeza in the 5th minute.The early setback woke up Leeza and the goalkeeper put all her effort to deny Paudel twice and Rashmi Ghising once to keep Nepal from scoring further.But Sabita Rana Magar undid Leeza in the 29th minute with a well-measured left-footed long ranger, which suddenly opened the floodgates. Paudel smelled blood and scored twice before the break—first flicking a cross from Ghising in the 32nd minute and then tapping in a pass from Sabita in the 42nd minute. The goal fest continued after the break as well. Paudel then completed her hat-trick three minutes into the restart smashing the roof of the net from close range after Aminath Zaahiya failed to clear her first attempt from a tight angle.Paudel got her fourth in the 63rd minute after Saru Limbu, who also engineered Nepal’s fifth goal earlier, put her through with a clever pass.Rai scored a screamer in the 65th for her individual second, arrowing from the edge of the box after Paudel cut back for her.Anita KC got Nepal’s eighth in the 69th seconds after coming off the bench after running into substitute Anita Basnet’s pass that collected a bit of luck off a deflection from Hawwa Haneefa.

But he said it remained to be seen what they would be doing there.“There is evidence that there are DPRK troops in Russia,” Austin told reporters, using North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.Speaking to reporters later on Wednesday White House spokesperson John Kirby said the United States believes at least 3,000 North Korean troops are undergoing training at three military bases in eastern Russia.The US determined the North Korean soldiers were transported by ship in early-to-mid October from North Korea’s Wonsan region to the eastern Russian city of Vladivostok before being taken to three military training sites in eastern Russia, said Kirby.“If they do deploy to fight against Ukraine, they’re fair game,” he said. “They’re fair targets and the Ukrainian military will defend themselves against North Korean soldiers the same way they’re defending themselves against Russian soldiers.”In Seoul, South Korean lawmakers said that Pyongyang had promised to provide a total of about 10,000 troops, whose deployment was expected to be completed by December, the lawmakers told reporters after being briefed by South Korea’s national intelligence agency.“Signs of troops being trained inside North Korea were detected in September and October,” Park Sun-won, a member of a parliamentary intelligence committee, said after the briefing.The Ukraine conflict broke out when Russia invaded its neighbor in February 2022 and has since developed into a war of attrition largely fought along front lines in eastern Ukraine, with huge numbers of casualties on both sides.The United States said the alleged North Korean deployment could be further evidence that the Russian military was having problems with manpower.The Kremlin has previously dismissed Seoul’s claims about the North’s troop deployment as “fake news” and a North Korean representative to the United Nations in New York called it “groundless rumors” at a meeting on Monday.Both Moscow and Pyongyang have also denied weapons transfers, but they have pledged to boost military ties and signed a mutual defense treaty at a summit in June.The latest numbers came after Seoul’s National Intelligence Service said on Friday the North had sent some 1,500 special forces personnel to Russia by ship and they were likely to be deployed for combat in the war in Ukraine after training and acclimatization.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has also accused Pyongyang of preparing to send 10,000 soldiers to Russia. On Tuesday he called on his allies to respond to evidence of North Korean involvement in Russia’s war.NATO allies are consulting on the North Korean deployment to Russia, a NATO spokesperson said.A Biden administration official said Moscow might send the North Koreans to eastern Ukraine or to its own Kursk region, where Russian troops have been fighting to dislodge Ukrainian forces holding a chunk of territory that they seized in an incursion that began in August.Mike Turner, the chair of the US House of Representatives intelligence committee, said in a statement that US President Joe Biden should allow Kyiv to respond with US-supplied arms if North Korean troops “attack Ukraine from Russian territory.”“If North Korean troops were to invade Ukraine’s sovereign territory, the United States needs to seriously consider taking direct military action against the North Korean troops,” Turner added.FAMILIES ISOLATEDLee Seong-kweun, a lawmaker on the South Korean committee, said Pyongyang authorities had tried to keep news of the deployment from spreading.“There are also signs of North Korean authorities relocating and isolating those families (of the troops) in a certain place in order to effectively control them and thoroughly crack down on the rumours,” Lee said, citing the spy agency.Lee also said the agency confirmed that Russia had recruited a large number of interpreters for the North Korean soldiers, while training them in the use of military equipment such as drones.“Russian instructors are assessing that the North Korean military has excellent physical attributes and morale but lacks understanding of modern warfare such as drone attacks,” he said.“Therefore, there could be many casualties if they are deployed to the front lines.”US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, say Russia has suffered more than 600,000 killed or wounded troops in the war in Ukraine.On Tuesday the South’s presidential office urged an immediate withdrawal of the North’s troops from Russia, warning that it may consider supplying lethal weapons to Ukraine if military ties between them went too far.

Israel’s evacuation orders this week have for the first time encompassed swathes of Tyre, right up to its ancient castle.“We are better off dying with dignity than living on the street,” said Batoum Zalghout, 25, who fled the latest evacuation zone for another part of the city.

A day earlier it confirmed it had killed Hashem Safieddine, the militant group's heir apparent leader after Hassan Nasrallah's death in a September 27 Israeli airstrike.Israeli strikes on Lebanon over the past month have killed nearly the entire leadership of Hezbollah, blows without precedent in the four decades of Israel’s battles against the group. Killing Sinwar last week in Gaza caps that with a major blow to its other big foe, Hamas.Arriving in Lebanon for talks on how to end hostilities, Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said providing arms to Israel posed a dilemma: “On the one hand, Israel is attacked every day and not supporting it would mean that people are not (being) protected ...

","summary":"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken pushed on Wednesday for a halt to fighting in Gaza and a diplomatic solution to conflict in Lebanon, but Israeli strikes on an historic Lebanese port city proved there was no respite yet.Huge clouds of smoke billowed above residential buildings in Tyre, a UNESCO-listed port city in south Lebanon, which Israel began bombing hours after issuing an order online telling residents to flee central areas.Tens of thousands of people have already fled Tyre as Israel steps up its campaign to destroy Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, both close allies of its arch Middle East enemy Iran.The port is typically bustling - with fishermen, tourists and even UN peacekeepers on a break from deployments. Israel’s evacuation orders this week have for the first time encompassed swathes of Tyre, right up to its ancient castle.“We are better off dying with dignity than living on the street,” said Batoum Zalghout, 25, who fled the latest evacuation zone for another part of the city.

The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” ","summary":"Chaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread.

If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” "},{"hash":"7ea85e731597bdeb1671d95bca3078159d53ed7499444aaf8b71b7db12d28349","title":"the-kumari-tradition-lives-on-balancing-ancient-and-modern-values","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/08/01/the-kumari-tradition-lives-on-balancing-ancient-and-modern-values","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/news/kumari-1722472781.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1722470400000,"source":"kp","category":"national","content":"In 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina.

Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. ","summary":"What animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo.

Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) ","summary":"Nepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic.

What’s more, there are takers of the ‘blessing’ who see the act as an opportunity to prove allegiance to the president, prime minister or head of an institution. The practice of subservience of receiving tika from bosses (who may not necessarily be elders) now has extended to even the head of a small bureaucracy or security apparatus unit.This Dashain, Nepali royalists who dream of restoring the monarchy deposed 16 years ago compared the queue-length of the people vying to receive tika from former King Gyanendra Shah and President Ram Chandra Poudel. They not only interpreted the larger turnout at Shah's residence as the growing popularity of the former King but also extrapolated the political possibility of restoration of the monarchy as the alternative to widespread governance failure under the current federal republican system.Governance failureLately, irrespective of the tika barometer, political discourse with apparent right-tilted traction has intensified in different shades and manifestations.

However, even the basics of the information are enough to counter this anti-federalism tirade.The Panchayat system divided the country into five ‘development’ regions. In addition, there were 14 zones as active units headed by the zonal commissioner directly appointed by the king. There were 75 district administrative offices and nearly 4,000 municipal and village panchayats as local politico-administrative units. The zonal structure has been liquidated, much of the functions of the district offices have been devolved to local governments, and the number of municipalities/rural municipalities has now been reduced to seven hundred and fifty-three. Therefore, the prognosis of an exorbitant rise in public expenditure just because of the transition from unitary to federal polity is not immediately evident. A comparative cost-benefit analysis in public service delivery warrants a systematic evaluation before resorting to sweeping political conclusions.The fundamental premise of the rightists’ argument that a unitary system of governance led by an absolute monarch is better than the federal system with extensive power of public functions devolved to the local levels is preposterous. Whether we call it a federal, devolved or decentralised system, the importance of extending the arms of the state closer to the beneficiaries of public services can hardly be overemphasised.'Hindu' politicsHindu state (rashtra) and Hindu kingdom are not the same politically. But Nepali royalists interpret the campaign to revert the constitutional provision of secularism—a campaign which also has the participation of many republican-minded politicians—as also the movement for restoring the Hindu monarch. Buoyed by the Bharatiya Janata Party's agenda of making India a Hindu-rashtra, Nepal's monarchists pushing beyond a step or two are keen to customise this Hindutva politics to suit their interest of reinstating the king.Though not very explicit, the overall tilt of new political forces like the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and 'independent' politicians like Balendra (Balen) Shah (mayor of Kathmandu metropolis) and Harka Sampang Rai (mayor of Dharan sub-metropolitan city) is essentially rightist and, therefore, regressive.The RSP is vocally against the federal constitution.

These incidents have left countless passengers stranded at airports, both at home and abroad.Technical disruptions are nothing new to Nepal Airlines, but these recent problems have compounded the carrier’s woes. Such failures have inconvenienced passengers, raised concerns about their safety, tarnished the corporation’s image and burdened it with huge losses. For instance, a high-profit route like Kathmandu-Narita (Japan) has been disrupted, which would otherwise have brought in around Rs20 million for the airlines on normal days. Moreover, due to the grounding of the Makalu aircraft in Italy, the airlines is losing Rs20 million daily in its business. It also has the added burden of accommodating passengers whose flights were delayed and whose tickets to connecting flights had to be rebooked at exorbitant prices. If this state of affairs continues, it is only a matter of time before the inevitable question arises: Why do we need this white elephant of an organisation? The problems don’t end with technical issues. As concerning is the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal’s (CAAN) dereliction of duty, which has pushed Nepal further back on the EU Air Safety List.

It seems like our government stakeholders in aviation are simply uninterested in having safe skies or in increasing the quality of service of our national flag carrier. Nepal Airlines came into operation in 1958, two years before Thai Airways. The former is barely functional with a juddering fleet of six while the latter is thriving with a fleet-footed fleet of 79.

Misusing the funds of hundreds of thousands of poor depositors, most of whom occupy the lowest rungs of the national economic ladder, is the most dastardly crime. We thus hope that those named by the committee, including Lamichhane, are brought to book. But that is not enough. Following Lamichhane’s arrest, his supporters have been blaming the government of being motivated by personal vendetta against the RSP chair. As evidence, they point to Nepali Congress vice-president Dhanaraj Gurung and CPN-UML federal lawmaker Rishikesh Pokharel, who, they allege, are being let off the hook despite their involvement in similar scandals.Gurung is accused of abetting the misappropriation of funds from a Lalitpur-based cooperative. He reportedly helped his ex-wife, Joyti Gurung, embezzle around Rs12.5 million. Similarly, there are accusations that Pokharel, the CPN-UML leader who is also the chair of Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee, helped his wife, Anjala Koirala, embezzle as much as Rs120 million from a Morang-based cooperative. Apparently, the Congress-UML government is using all its power to save them from prosecution. Whether that is the case, these critics of the government do have a point. To show that the government machinery is not targeting a single person or party, the allegations against the top Congress and UML leaders should also be thoroughly investigated and the respective parties must help with such probes. The larger goal here is not only to punish particular people like Lamichhane or GB Rai, Lamichhane’s partner-in-crime at Galaxy 4k TV run by the Gorkha Media Network. It is rather to clean up the cooperative sector, one of the three pillars of the national economy. Moreover, the prosecution of Lamichhane will seem credible only if there is also an impartial investigation of the allegations against top leaders affiliated with the ruling coalition. Thankfully, at least in Gurung’s case, the Central Investigation Bureau of the Nepal Police is already looking into his involvement in the Lalitpur-based cooperative. But what is the Congress doing on the matter? In the case of Pokharel, it would be wise of the UML to conduct an internal investigation. The law enforcement agencies can then take over. Such an initiative of the prime minister’s party would buttress the public image of both the UML and the country’s executive head. Given the widespread cynicism with the state machinery, it has become vital to restore some public faith in it. That is difficult when the prime minister himself accepts gargantuan donations to establish a party office. Such gestures signal that PM Oli considers himself above the law. There is growing skepticism of the government representatives’ commitment to the people, or of their ability to work impartially. If some people are prosecuted while others facing similar charges are spared, even genuine cases of cooperatives frauds like those involving former home minister Lamichhane will seem a suspect. Prime Minister Oli and his coalition partners know that well, don’t they?   ","summary":"Given the mountain of evidence piled up by the special parliamentary probe committee to establish his involvement in the misappropriation of funds of various cooperatives, the arrest of Rabi Lamichhane, the Rastriya Swatantra Party chief and former deputy prime minister and home minister, was inevitable.

Similarly, there are accusations that Pokharel, the CPN-UML leader who is also the chair of Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee, helped his wife, Anjala Koirala, embezzle as much as Rs120 million from a Morang-based cooperative. Apparently, the Congress-UML government is using all its power to save them from prosecution. Whether that is the case, these critics of the government do have a point. To show that the government machinery is not targeting a single person or party, the allegations against the top Congress and UML leaders should also be thoroughly investigated and the respective parties must help with such probes. The larger goal here is not only to punish particular people like Lamichhane or GB Rai, Lamichhane’s partner-in-crime at Galaxy 4k TV run by the Gorkha Media Network. It is rather to clean up the cooperative sector, one of the three pillars of the national economy. Moreover, the prosecution of Lamichhane will seem credible only if there is also an impartial investigation of the allegations against top leaders affiliated with the ruling coalition. Thankfully, at least in Gurung’s case, the Central Investigation Bureau of the Nepal Police is already looking into his involvement in the Lalitpur-based cooperative. But what is the Congress doing on the matter? In the case of Pokharel, it would be wise of the UML to conduct an internal investigation. The law enforcement agencies can then take over. Such an initiative of the prime minister’s party would buttress the public image of both the UML and the country’s executive head. Given the widespread cynicism with the state machinery, it has become vital to restore some public faith in it. That is difficult when the prime minister himself accepts gargantuan donations to establish a party office. Such gestures signal that PM Oli considers himself above the law. There is growing skepticism of the government representatives’ commitment to the people, or of their ability to work impartially. If some people are prosecuted while others facing similar charges are spared, even genuine cases of cooperatives frauds like those involving former home minister Lamichhane will seem a suspect. Prime Minister Oli and his coalition partners know that well, don’t they?   "},{"hash":"e43124c8affc6db621340f33492a02fea3e43480500d33d0e89e4c8f0e69cd76","title":"unfruitful-labour","link":"https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/10/17/unfruitful-labour","imageLink":"https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/opinion/thumb34-1729171715.jpg&w=900&height=601","date":1729123200000,"source":"kp","category":"editorial","content":"The mountainous regions of Nepal are famous for their succulent apples. For farmers in these areas, especially in Karnali Province, apple cultivation is their primary income source.

About the same quantity is expected this year. Yet, as promising as this sounds, it is disheartening that much of this produce never reaches intended markets due to the poor state of roads and other logistical challenges. After living in the shadows for several decades, even the far-flung places of Karnali have in recent years been connected to the roads; however, these roads are unreliable as monsoon-related natural disasters often make them impassable, especially during the apple harvest season. Last year, Dolpa district produced 3,696 tonnes of apples, but only 50 tonnes reached the lowland markets. Simikot, in the same year, harvested 4,224 tonnes, but none could be taken to other places due to transportation failures. The situation in Simikot is no better this year, as vehicles have not plied these roads for over three months. Poor roads are victimising the farmers in many ways. While the fruit is sold at Rs250 per kg in Kathmandu, farmers in Karnali’s Jubetha, for instance, get a meagre Rs45 for the same quantity. When the roads close, the price of transporting apples to lowland markets in Nepal rockets, further squeezing the farmers who are already at a disadvantage. Then come middlemen and traders, who reap the benefits of the farmers’ haplessness, charging extra to transport the apples. Seeing the fruits of their labour rot, some farmers resort to traditional store methods but still lose half of their produce. Others rely on air transport and mules, often resulting in more loss than profit.Hundreds of families have invested their time, money and labour in commercial apple farming, which has enhanced the reputation of Nepal’s apples abroad. They deserve more state support. There is an urgent need to improve farmers’ access to logistics, including bigger-storage facilities and efficient packaging methods, in the Karnali Province in particular. It is as important to expand the scope of subsidies in transport and storage. Given the recurring road blockages on the Nepali side of the border, exploring alternative nearby markets in Tibet could also be an option. Moreover, apples can be turned into value-added products to prevent waste, extend their shelf life and sell them in local and international markets. Farmers can be trained to ferment apples to make juice and local apple raksi (apple brandy). Many farmers also air-dry or sun-dry apples to increase their shelf life. These alternative products could open up new markets and prevent waste and loss.But above all, authorities should prioritise building disaster-resilient roads and routine maintenance to ensure year-round operation of vehicles.

He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isn’t possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the country’s largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oli’s acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We can’t say anything about the government agencies’ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies can’t enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSP’s concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperatives’ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhane’s case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepal’s development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal can’t progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them weren’t built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people aren’t brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individuals’ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies can’t take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai—were not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers weren’t prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the party’s transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our party’s agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesn’t mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party can’t accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our party’s present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance.

But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance.

At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies.

Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. ","summary":"Nepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back.

It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential.

The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority.
